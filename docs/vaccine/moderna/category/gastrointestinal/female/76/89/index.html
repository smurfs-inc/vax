                                                VACCINE received on Friday 1/15/2021 afternoon; Monday evening 1/18/2021 felt slight chills; early to bed. Tuesday AM awoke with severe &#39;bed-rocking&#39; chills, nausea and fever 100-101 degrees. recommended I go to Hospital ER.  At ER, temperature increased to 102 degrees.  Covid test was negative, but cost X-ray showed reasons to suspect pneumonia. No one suggested I was just suffering acute reaction to vaccine.  Returned home w/ prescription for doxycycline hyclate and request that I return to the ER the next day if I continued to feel ill.  The next morning, 1/19/21, I again awoke with intense, somewhat frightening chills, vomiting and a mild fever.  As instructed I returned to the ER.  Assuming the COVID Test may have been a false negative, a second one was given; it too turned out to be negative, but I remained at the ER and then admitted to Hospital to remain under observation.  Im the hospital the chills, nausea and fever came to an end, but acute headache and utter fatigue lasted until I was released on Jan 22.  My discharge papers indicated no further signs of pneumonia or any other infection; my attending doctor, concluded that my experience was an unusually strong (and delayed) reaction to the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine.

Since Saturday I have been trouble with my stomach which isn&#39;t anything unusual. It seems like it is upset.

I took a baby aspirin because I was afraid I was having a stroke. This lasted about 5 hours. Then I developed a head ache just behind my nose. The headache subsided in the mid afternoon, but I was wiped out and slept most of the day. Today (the next morning) I feel fine, just a little tired.

                                                My arm wasn&#39;t sore right away but I think I laid on it and the next morning it was sore. It felt like a bee sting I took some medicine and it went away.  On the 27th I had bad gas. I did try a new cereal and thought it was cereal. On the 28th I still gas and upset stomach like flu like symptoms  and felt light headed but not bad. On the 29th still an upset stomach and had diarrhea, I was still light headed and really shaky. I was really weak. I was shaking a lot at arms (hands) and legs were both shaking  and made it hard to walk. On the 30th I still really light headed and my legs and hands were still shaky, still having difficulty walking, still had an upset stomach and still felt weak. On the 31st my stomach was a lot better, I was still shaky and light headed, and I had a weak feeling. My head felt like when you feel like you have a head cold (pressure in my head). Today my stomach is better, I am still lightheaded and still shaky but not as bad. I still feel pressure in my head, but no runny nose or any other cold symptoms.   These were symptoms I had in March when I was sick for 3 weeks. I was negative for COVID but didn&#39;t get back to my normal self until the June.   Doctor was a private practice and recently closed so I do not see my new doctor till the 24th.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I was sitting in a well organized waiting area I started feeling flames in my throat. My throat was literally on fire. I raised my hand as I was instructed to do. I asked for water, they brought me a bottle water, I started to drink it. My throat was having a difficult time swallowing. They brought me over to nursing area. I went into this area and the nurses were there. They made me take my mask off, they took my blood pressure was way lower then normal (110/30). Then they gave me 50MG Benadryl. They called EMS and I refused to go. I had to wait at the clinic until the Benadryl took effect. The &#34;flame&#34; feeling began to lessen. When I got home I took another dose of Benadryl.  The &#34;flame&#34; feeling went away but then I was left with a sore throat for the rest of the night and the following morning. It felt like there was an actual fire in my throat that the Benadryl put out but then it felt as if the after effects of a burn in my throat.    I do have a call in to my primary care provider and still waiting for a call back.

                                                I had Covid on 25 Nov. 2020.  I had extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, aching, headaches and abdominal pain. I have IBS which flared up during this time.  It took me December and January to finally get over the fatigue part. When I received my vaccination on Feb. 12, 2021 (Moderna) by that evening I began to run a temp. of 102-103. I had chills, headache, abdominal pain (worse than in Nov.), fatigue, some dizziness, and short of breath. I felt like I had Covid all over again!  I was down for 5 days. On Sunday afternoon, Feb 14 I went to the Clinic to see the doctor on call.  I was told they could not test me since I had Covid November 25 and it hadn&#39;t been 90 days and I would still have the antibodies.

                                                On Wednesday afternoon she had a fever of 103, was very fatigued.  Got up in the middle of the night and had dry heaves, went back to bed and was okay.  Her arm got really red, hot and blisters all over it like a sunburn.  It is down to about the size of a half dollar today.  The blisters burst and have made places, is still warm and sore and looks like it is drying up.  Did look like a severe sunburn.  She ran a little fever until Thursday night 2/18/21.  The arm is still sore to touch today, 2/22/21.  She took some Tylenol the night her fever was 103, then it went to 101.   The fatigue is diminishing, she has slept a lot, but wonders if her arm is ever going to be right.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

By 7pm I was dizzy and nauseated, and it got worse, I got chills and shook and shook and shook, I had a fever and the next day I tried to get out of bed, and I fell to the floor and couldn?t stand up, I had no energy or appetite. I had covid in August 2020 and the wasn?t made aware of the possible side effects if you had covid. They didn?t ask if I had covid in the past and the pharmacist told me later that people who has had covid has reported having bad side effects. I had gone a couple weeks ago to see if I had the covid antibodies and I was positive for antibodies and the injection works against the antibiotics. This part of the procedure was overlooked. I have no one else to help me and going through this alone, it would have been better to have been made aware of this ahead of time.

The area does not really itch, but is just red.  For the first two days, the rash didn&#39;t move.  Then over the next several days, the rash starting spreading down the upper arm. On February 18, the patient experienced bad diarrhea.  On February 21, the patient put a cold damp cloth over the area to soothe the area.  Some areas within the rash are improving, but the redness continues to spread down the arm.  The area felt like a bad sunburn, and the patient put some salve on it one day, but did not notice a difference.

Felt pretty much over it by Feb 21 but still some weakness and fatigue.  Also a very sore arm that turned pink and feb 22 is still sore and pink and itchy but not as bad as the previous days.  I have always gotten a sore arm with flu shots but not as bad as this time so I didn&#39;t consider that a bad reaction.

                                                Was napping the day after receiving the vaccine and woke up about 3:00 pm to severe chest pain on the right side radiating deep into the shoulder blade.  It would last about 5 - 10 min., stop for the same amount of time, then start up again.... on &amp; off until close to 11:00 pm.   Since someone else I know had the same thing happen the day after her shot, I assumed I had the same symptom, tho&#39; it was very frightening.  A week later after going to bed on Friday night, I woke at 2:00 a.m. to the same pain only this time on my left side.  Thinking I could be having a heart attack, I went to the hospital where I was admitted after having a series of tests.  I was there for 2 days during which time I also began to have un-controllable diarrhea.  Altho&#39; they could find nothing wrong with my heart,  after scans, x-rays, a stress test, numerous blood tests etc., they cannot say positively whether or not it was from the Covid vaccine.  I tho&#39;t it best to report this in case others have similar events.  I had the MODERNA vaccine

                                                A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 80-year-old, female patient who suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia).                                                                                                                      The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided/unknown by the reporter.    On 01-FEB-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 007M20A)  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 01-MAR-2021, the patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Batch number: 023M20A) in her left (dominant) arm.   On 02-MAR-2021, she experienced a side effect which was not listed in the sheet she was given. She wanted to call and report the side effect. She said that she was at the stove cooking and suddenly felt very weak and felt that her vision started to flip. She called for her husband to come over who seated her on a chair. After that she says she doesn&#39;t remember what happened, but her husband told her that her whole body was shaking, her head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds. When she came back, she could hear a rushing sound coming out of her left ear. She was also drenched in perspiration. She felt very nauseated and cold the whole afternoon.  On 03-MAR-2021 she felt better. She had a low grade fever of 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events, suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia) was considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.   The out come of the event, head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I understand that there may or may not be a link between my mother&#39;s symptoms and the vaccine, but I want to make sure that it is looked into.  Three days after dose, my mother woke up with shortness of breath.  Over the last week, the shortness of breath has lingered and she has also had stomach issues.   She has now been hospitalized since yesterday.  These are not uncommon symptoms with her, but she  has definitely been worse since the vaccine.  Assuming she recovers, I am concerned about her taking the second dose, scheduled in two weeks.  Her symptoms are very similar to those of a Physician in an article I read today.

She went to bed, and all night and into the next day had fever/chills.  She got up during the night to get some water she collapsed and could not get up as she was so weak.  Her husband found her and helped her back to bed.  Today, 2/22/21 she is better today and feels almost to normal.   She took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea.   Tylenol/Ibuprofen did not take the headache, but it did finally go away.   The headache was on the top of her head.

As of today, the following Friday the 12th, she is still weak and unsteady at times, where she was previously ambulating fine with adequate energy.  Still feels like she has no strength.

                                                Patient reported feeling weak, fatigue, fever (102), and loss of appetite. Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine I had racing heartbeat for 2 hours. I was short of breath over the next few days. I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

Back in the middle of February the patient had a high-grade small-bowel obstruction ended up with laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.  She was extremely deconditioned.  She came to swing bed here and states here for about 2 weeks.  She thought she was ready to go home and be successful at that time.  Unfortunately, she has gotten home and found that she can barely take care of herself.  She is extremely deconditioned.  She thinks she just needs to be built up for another week or 2 and then could be very successful at home.  She does have a friend that is helping her, but is worried about getting so weak that she end up hurting herself.  I saw her yesterday in the office and thought that another swing bed stay a might be in order.

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Treatment information included was acetaminophen for headache. The patient was hospitalized with coivd in January and had 5 days of Remdesivir. The patient also had problem with a lymph node in that arm. She had a Lumpectomy. They took at a lymph node in the left side of that armpit to see if it had spread. It was sensitive when she had a breast exam and was sent to get a mammogram. Got the breast exam last week in February.  Based on the current available information a temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded. Headache, fatigue, myalgia, nausea and injection site lymphadenopathy are consistent with the product safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information a temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded.

                                                The injection did sting, but didn&#39;t think anything about it. For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

She was eating breakfast after at home and complained to a neighbor that her teeth hurt and she was nauseated after eating. In the afternoon, she felt dizzy and had diarrhea accompanied with blood. Close to 9 PM, her son went to check on her. The patient was found on the floor--she was unresponsive and had purple lips. Her son called an ambulance and started chest compressions. The patient passed away at the hospital. The doctor has ordered an autopsy, and the results are pending.

Felt like her face was drawn and tight. This morning, she has been very shaky, sounds like some congestion in her chest (cough), very tired, very dry mouth. She is never sick, so this is alarming to her and to me.

                                                The following day, food did not taste as it should and water tasted like metal.  By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

She was sick to her stomach, really tired and lost her appetite.   On the 22nd I called her doctor again... no response, on the 23 I called again.  On the 24th finally someone spoke to me.. they stated they had called my mom and spoke with her.  They are suppose to call me, my mom could not remember by the time she would hang up.  They said to let her rest and give her electrolytes and Vit. B6.  On the 26th when I called the doctor and said she is lethargic they said to take her to the ER.  She flat lined at the hospital and her body went into shock.  She ended up having Kidney, Heart and Liver Failure.  She was still driving and doing all of her cooking, banking, shopping, showering, walking every day on Feb 18th.  She died on March 5th.

                                                Got shot on Wed. 2/10/2021. Started feeling ill within a few hours. Next day, was &#34;sick&#34; and needed to vomit (but didn&#39;t).  Temperatures for 3 days was less than normal.  95.6 to 96.1.  FridayI I started vomiting and had incidents of a pain in my stomach area and by that night became sicker and dehydrated.  Was so sick I couldn&#39;t get out of bed to get water (I live alone).  By midnight Friday (12:00) Feb. 13 I was so sick I called daughter to take me to hospital.  Went to ER and then did blood work.  Blood work showed  liver enzymes were over 500 and eventually reached over 600, when normal is under 100.  Was admitted to hospital.  My electrolytes were out of &#34;whack&#34; too.  My doctor told me in 11 years practice she had never seen a liver enzymes reading over 600.  I am scared to take another vaccine shot at this point.  Note:  I had blood work done Friday, March 5, 2021 and my liver enzymes was 26 -- normal but I am not interested in getting that sick again and I have concerns about my liver.

                                                Though patient was experiencing pain due to her arthritis, soon after the vaccination (1-2 hours) she experienced increased knee pain in both legs. Since the vaccination, she has also had bad diarrhea. Lastly, the worst symptom she experienced was light headedness and fatigue. At around 8:30pm on the day of the vaccination, she got up from dinner to go to bed a bit early. She was feeling tired and started to fade. She fell backwards against the wall, hit her head and landed on her bottom. Thankfully, I was there to help her up and was able to stay up with her to ensure she didn&#39;t have a concussion. Admittedly, she did not drink much water that day so it&#39;s possible this exacerbated the side effects of the vaccine. Maybe the clinics can offer people water bottles or other hydrating beverages to ensure things like this don&#39;t happen?

                                                throat closure three weeks after second dose; has lost the ability to swallow.; hernia; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning an 88-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced throat closure three weeks after second dose/obstruction, hernia, and lost ability to swallow/dyphagia.  The patient&#39;s medical history included an aortic valve replacement. Concomitant medications were not provided by the reporter.   On 13 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 01120A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 10 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 007M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection  On an unknown date, the patient had lost the ability to swallow. Patient was taken to the ER and ER doctors thought it was a hernia and suggested a surgery. This was three weeks post dose of the vaccine. The reporter reported that the patient was taken to the hospital on 4 Mar 2021. The doctor diagnosed hernia, but they didn&#39;t explain the throat closing. They told him to take the patient to a GI doctor. The GI didn&#39;t think it was necessary to do a surgery and scheduled a colonoscopy.  The reporter disagreed with the colonoscopy because it didn&#39;t address the throat swelling. The hospital had put the patient on IV fluids but didn&#39;t have a lot of answers. On 8 Mar 2021, the hospital prescribed antibiotics and speech therapy.   Treatment activities reported by the reporter included IV fluids, antibiotics, and speech therapy .  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of events, obstruction, hernia, and dysphagia were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events were consistent with increased risk of complications associated with elderly age of patient. Company assessed the events to be unlikely related to company product.

Has had diarrhea for the last 3 days, nausea and generally feeling bad.  The first week had a lot of drowsiness, had fogginess as far as thinking.   The first few days took Tylenol and did not take anymore as her daughter said it contained aspirin for the pain.  Still having the headache, feeling like she is not thinking real good.  About a month ago had blood work and everything was perfect, no problems.  Due to the fact that she is still having these reactions 2 weeks from the injections wanted to report it.

Patient verbally reported to me that about 4 hours after the shot, she began experiencing severe shocks all over her face and into her left neck and chest area.  This quickly worsened to include her left arm.  That all resolved after a nap.  But when she woke up, and went to the mirror, she noted that her left face was slow and drooping.  She went to the ER.  It was noted that she was having a severe problem with swallowing.  She also was noting severe pain in left external ear canal.  She had obvious severe breakout in the left ear canal - and the immediate area.  She was sent home - and came to my office the next day.  By that time, the symptoms had become much much worse.  She was unable to swallow.  The outbreak in the left ear was much more pronounced.  And her entire left face and left tongue were paralyzed.  She was diagnosed with the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome - she was unable to talk or swallow.  She was readmitted back into the hospital.
