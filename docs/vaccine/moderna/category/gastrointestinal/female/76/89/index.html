The symptoms I&#39;ve had from the shot are pretty much the same as when I was sick.  I was fortunate not to have any respiratory symptoms either time as confirmed by my oximeter.  I had two Antibody tests.  One on Nov. 23rd, which was positive for both  IgG and IgM.  I had my second anti-body test on 1/17/2021, the day of my injection which was positive for IgG and negative for IgM.  I have not contacted my doctor concerning this and I am taking Advil for the fever and ached and pains.  Today i feel better than yesterday.

                                                VACCINE received on Friday 1/15/2021 afternoon; Monday evening 1/18/2021 felt slight chills; early to bed. Tuesday AM awoke with severe &#39;bed-rocking&#39; chills, nausea and fever 100-101 degrees. recommended I go to Hospital ER.  At ER, temperature increased to 102 degrees.  Covid test was negative, but cost X-ray showed reasons to suspect pneumonia. No one suggested I was just suffering acute reaction to vaccine.  Returned home w/ prescription for doxycycline hyclate and request that I return to the ER the next day if I continued to feel ill.  The next morning, 1/19/21, I again awoke with intense, somewhat frightening chills, vomiting and a mild fever.  As instructed I returned to the ER.  Assuming the COVID Test may have been a false negative, a second one was given; it too turned out to be negative, but I remained at the ER and then admitted to Hospital to remain under observation.  Im the hospital the chills, nausea and fever came to an end, but acute headache and utter fatigue lasted until I was released on Jan 22.  My discharge papers indicated no further signs of pneumonia or any other infection; my attending doctor, concluded that my experience was an unusually strong (and delayed) reaction to the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine.

It has stayed sore since then, Yesterday it was bothering me so I looked and noticed there was knot about the size bigger the a dime but smaller then a quarter.  Slightly red area the injection site and has been itching. Feels warm to touch. I haven&#39;t really bad or anything. Since Saturday I have been trouble with my stomach which isn&#39;t anything unusual. It seems like it is upset.

I took a baby aspirin because I was afraid I was having a stroke. This lasted about 5 hours. Then I developed a head ache just behind my nose. The headache subsided in the mid afternoon, but I was wiped out and slept most of the day. Today (the next morning) I feel fine, just a little tired.

                                                My arm wasn&#39;t sore right away but I think I laid on it and the next morning it was sore. It felt like a bee sting I took some medicine and it went away.  On the 27th I had bad gas. I did try a new cereal and thought it was cereal. On the 28th I still gas and upset stomach like flu like symptoms  and felt light headed but not bad. On the 29th still an upset stomach and had diarrhea, I was still light headed and really shaky. I was really weak. I was shaking a lot at arms (hands) and legs were both shaking  and made it hard to walk. On the 30th I still really light headed and my legs and hands were still shaky, still having difficulty walking, still had an upset stomach and still felt weak. On the 31st my stomach was a lot better, I was still shaky and light headed, and I had a weak feeling. My head felt like when you feel like you have a head cold (pressure in my head). Today my stomach is better, I am still lightheaded and still shaky but not as bad. I still feel pressure in my head, but no runny nose or any other cold symptoms.   These were symptoms I had in March when I was sick for 3 weeks. I was negative for COVID but didn&#39;t get back to my normal self until the June.   Doctor was a private practice and recently closed so I do not see my new doctor till the 24th.

There was some blood at the site and I still have a black and blue mark)

I went to Clinic Saturday 2/13, for being unbalanced and weak, but not so dizzy. Sunday 2/14 I was extremely weak with low blood pressure and fast heart rate.  Monday  2/15, in the morning,  my left arm started hurting, swelling, was feverish, red, itchy and I had a rash at the injection site. I went to my doctor on 2/19 and he stated that maybe I should not get the 2nd vaccine shot. He stated that he was not certain that everything that happened was a result of the vaccine, but that he couldn&#39;t say that it wasn&#39;t.

She went to bed around 8:00 PM and then she couldn&#39;t sleep all night.  She kept trying to drink liquid, running fever, hot and opened a window with temp being 30 outside.  She could hardly walk to the bathroom due to the muscle weakness and fear of falling.  She tossed and turned all night long.  She got up and her temp was 99.8, and she was told not to go to PT this morning.  She is being treated for a frozen shoulder.   She feels dehydrated and is drinking water, and going to drink Ginger ale and crackers due to the nausea.

Stayed in bed with head flat for 2 days. Had to be helped to the bathroom. No walking capabilities. Gradually started coming out of it on the third day, still not able to have head up while trying to eat and drink. 4th day better in the morning with head up and walking. Seemingly gone by evening. Horrible episode.

The next morning I woke up and the rash was there, and spread over the different areas of body. I was sweating bad, muscle pain, joint pain, and nauseated for about 3 days. I had knots in my arms. I went to the doctor last week, and she gave me a shot in the hip, it helped with the swelling.  Then I called her back and she called in a cream for me.  The other symptom remaining is the rash at the injection site, I have been putting the cream on it twice a day, taking Benadryl and Tylenol for pain

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I was sitting in a well organized waiting area I started feeling flames in my throat. My throat was literally on fire. I raised my hand as I was instructed to do. I asked for water, they brought me a bottle water, I started to drink it. My throat was having a difficult time swallowing. They brought me over to nursing area. I went into this area and the nurses were there. They made me take my mask off, they took my blood pressure was way lower then normal (110/30). Then they gave me 50MG Benadryl. They called EMS and I refused to go. I had to wait at the clinic until the Benadryl took effect. The &#34;flame&#34; feeling began to lessen. When I got home I took another dose of Benadryl.  The &#34;flame&#34; feeling went away but then I was left with a sore throat for the rest of the night and the following morning. It felt like there was an actual fire in my throat that the Benadryl put out but then it felt as if the after effects of a burn in my throat.    I do have a call in to my primary care provider and still waiting for a call back.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.  2:00 am 1/28/2021- woke up feeling queasy, joints in legs were achy. My left  knee replacement felt like it was in a vise,  This  was a  short lived event with some residual feeling in the knee in the morning.   3 days after injection  10:00 pm 1/30/2021- I noticed a small rash on my left abdomen near the navel, this rash moved quickly to the left and soon covered entire left abdomen, moving to the groin area then down left inner thigh.  I took a Benazepril and went to bed. During the night I woke up several time with a strong pressure in left bowel area. Changing position seemed to help and went back to sleep. woke up about 5 am and checked the rash which was mostly gone except for the original spot where it began.  The rash and pressure seemed to be restricted to front left side below waist area. It is now 11:00 am 1/31/2021 and I am feeling fine, very little residual rash at initial site.   I had not read anything about delayed reactions as late as 3 1/2 days after the injection so wanted to report this event.

                                                I had Covid on 25 Nov. 2020.  I had extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, aching, headaches and abdominal pain. I have IBS which flared up during this time.  It took me December and January to finally get over the fatigue part. When I received my vaccination on Feb. 12, 2021 (Moderna) by that evening I began to run a temp. of 102-103. I had chills, headache, abdominal pain (worse than in Nov.), fatigue, some dizziness, and short of breath. I felt like I had Covid all over again!  I was down for 5 days. On Sunday afternoon, Feb 14 I went to the Clinic to see the doctor on call.  I was told they could not test me since I had Covid November 25 and it hadn&#39;t been 90 days and I would still have the antibodies.

                                                On Wednesday afternoon she had a fever of 103, was very fatigued.  Got up in the middle of the night and had dry heaves, went back to bed and was okay.  Her arm got really red, hot and blisters all over it like a sunburn.  It is down to about the size of a half dollar today.  The blisters burst and have made places, is still warm and sore and looks like it is drying up.  Did look like a severe sunburn.  She ran a little fever until Thursday night 2/18/21.  The arm is still sore to touch today, 2/22/21.  She took some Tylenol the night her fever was 103, then it went to 101.   The fatigue is diminishing, she has slept a lot, but wonders if her arm is ever going to be right.

                                                Started out with waking the next day a fullness in her head, but kind of a headache, and very tired.  Then a couple of hours later she got a severe case of the chills.  She laid down and slept on and off for about 5 hours.  When she got up she took her temperature and it was 101.  She also had body aches in her back and her legs felt very heavy.  She then noticed a rash on her body from a line that went underneath her breast, and redness on the left side of her breast to her belly button, all red around the belly button.   When she realized she had a fever she took Tylenol.  The rash by Saturday was fading and she also had diarrhea on Saturday, persistent diarrhea.  She felt almost normal except that she was tired.  Today, 3/1/21 she has the returned diarrhea, doesn&#39;t k now if it was related to the vaccine.  She spoke to a nurse yesterday, and she told that she had a typical side effect from the vaccine.  She was not sure if the diarrhea was from the vaccine.

At 9:15 pm, I had chills and fever for 3 hours  and during that time, my right forearm, wrist and hand became very, very sore.  I  couldn&#39;t even flex my fingers the pain was so bad.  Pain throughout my body continued during the night, including stomach cramps, back and leg pain and then I took another 200 mg of Advil at 9:15 am on 3/4.  I feel I am 20% improved 25 hours after my second shot.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

                                                The morning after receiving the vaccine, I woke up and was pretty dizzy which made me nauseous. I had to try a few times to get out the bed. It went off and on on Sunday then it went away.  (felt like I was suffering from vertigo) I do not think I have suffered from it since then.

                                                The first day felt fine, the next day when she got up in the morning she didn&#39;t feel well, but felt well enough to put a roast in the crockpot.  Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

The patient&#39;s medical history included Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included levothyroxine sodium.   On 08 Jan 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J20-2A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Jan 2021, the reporter states the patient went into a sharp decline, diarrhea, nausea, headache and sleeping 24 hours a day.   A few days later, the patient was not eating much and did not recognize her husband or family.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol, emergency room visits, and nursing care center placement.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed diarrhea, nausea, headache, sleeping 24 hours a day, not eating, and didn&#39;t recognize husband or family, were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 78-year-old, female patient with a medical history of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, who experienced unexpected events of diarrhea, hypersomnia, decreased appetite, confusional state and expected events of nausea and headache. The events of diarrhea, nausea, headache and hypersomnia occurred 5 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J20-2A) and, the events of decreased appetite and confusional state occurred unspecified number of days later. Treatment for the event included paracetamol, emergency room visits, and nursing care center placement. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Alzheimer&#39;s disease is a confounding factor too. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information has been requested.

By 7pm I was dizzy and nauseated, and it got worse, I got chills and shook and shook and shook, I had a fever and the next day I tried to get out of bed, and I fell to the floor and couldn?t stand up, I had no energy or appetite. I had covid in August 2020 and the wasn?t made aware of the possible side effects if you had covid. They didn?t ask if I had covid in the past and the pharmacist told me later that people who has had covid has reported having bad side effects. I had gone a couple weeks ago to see if I had the covid antibodies and I was positive for antibodies and the injection works against the antibiotics. This part of the procedure was overlooked. I have no one else to help me and going through this alone, it would have been better to have been made aware of this ahead of time.

Then was fine for 7 days.  On 2/5/2021, I went to get my B12 shot and asked the doctor to check left arm where Moderna shot was given as it was itching and a bit sore at the same time.  He told me I was having reaction.  By evening, a third of my arm around injected area was swollen an had red rash.  Then same symptoms of fatigue, etc. came back and I was in and out of bed for the next three days....then at end had a bout of diarrhea.

She took 2 Tylenol, and went back and laid down.  She then awoke the next day starting to have some chills but not as bad as the night before.  She covered up with an electric  blanket in a chair and finally passed over.  She noticed  Saturday that she had nausea and dizziness.  She then had  tenderness in her mouth, used warm salty water which seems to be helping.  She cannot eat any hard food on it due to the discomfort.  She has continued nausea in the evenings.  No problems with the arm where she got the vaccine.  She feels it it getting some better, but the dizziness and nausea is the worst issue.  She did call her doctor and they told her that they could not give her anything for the rash in her mouth, and the chills. They told her that it had to run it&#39;s course.

                                                About 9 days after my 1st dose of Moderna vaccine, I began to have itching on my right upper arm in the area of the injection.  That continues today.  Two days after I noticed the itching, the upper arm was hot to the touch, red, and swollen.  The area is about 6&#34; in diameter.  I did not have an elevated temperature, but I felt slightly nauseous and light-headed on March 5.    I had no reaction to the shot until a week and a half to two weeks after the injection.   I still have a red, itchy area on my right arm.  It seems to be slowly improving.

Next morning, diarrhea, fever, and was unable to stand up, even with aid of a walker and my husband&#39;s help. Muscle weakness, which  lasted about  24 hours. . After 24 hours, took 2 Tylenol,  Next day problem was gone. And no further problem with muscle weakness. Did read CDC recommendations, not to take 2nd dose if there were problems. And I will not be t aking the second one on 03-03021. Did call Health Dept and reported it but not sure what staff member I visited with, but it was not the nurse who gave injection nor the Administrator.

The area does not really itch, but is just red.  For the first two days, the rash didn&#39;t move.  Then over the next several days, the rash starting spreading down the upper arm. On February 18, the patient experienced bad diarrhea.  On February 21, the patient put a cold damp cloth over the area to soothe the area.  Some areas within the rash are improving, but the redness continues to spread down the arm.  The area felt like a bad sunburn, and the patient put some salve on it one day, but did not notice a difference.

Felt pretty much over it by Feb 21 but still some weakness and fatigue.  Also a very sore arm that turned pink and feb 22 is still sore and pink and itchy but not as bad as the previous days.  I have always gotten a sore arm with flu shots but not as bad as this time so I didn&#39;t consider that a bad reaction.

                                                Really tired on Monday the 22nd and I felt fatigued. I began to get nauseated and then I began to vomit. I vomited 5-6 times even though I had not eaten anything. I also had diarrhea. I had chills. Some point during the night I spiked a fever, I woke up and drenched. Yesterday  the 23rd I  had a fever, my stomach still does not feel settled. I have not ate much since Sunday but have been trying to stay hydrated with lots of water.  I also developed a cough yesterday. Tuesday night my temperature 100.6 and I think it got higher because I woke up once again drenched in sweat. This morning my temperature was 99.  I am achy today with muscle and joint pain,  my stomach feels better but I still leery of  eating. I did eat some Ginger ale and eat some saltine crackers.  I also feel horse.  I called my doctor yesterday and still have not heard back. I will call again today.  It feels like I feel better in the morning but as the day goes on I get worse and start feeling worse. I have been resting a lot in bed.

It would last about 5 - 10 min., stop for the same amount of time, then start up again.... on &amp; off until close to 11:00 pm.   Since someone else I know had the same thing happen the day after her shot, I assumed I had the same symptom, tho&#39; it was very frightening.  A week later after going to bed on Friday night, I woke at 2:00 a.m. to the same pain only this time on my left side.  Thinking I could be having a heart attack, I went to the hospital where I was admitted after having a series of tests.  I was there for 2 days during which time I also began to have un-controllable diarrhea.  Altho&#39; they could find nothing wrong with my heart,  after scans, x-rays, a stress test, numerous blood tests etc., they cannot say positively whether or not it was from the Covid vaccine.  I tho&#39;t it best to report this in case others have similar events.  I had the MODERNA vaccine

This lasted about 5 minutes and then subsequently resolved.  She then got up to leave and again began feeling the left chest pain, diaphoresis, and again lasting about 5 to 6 minutes and then subsequently resolving.  She does state a history of anxiety but did take Xanax this morning preventatively.  However, she states she has had similar pains in her chest over the past month.  She states these are not necessarily associated with any exertion and seemed to be somewhat better after antacids.  She notes she has not had anything to eat or drink this morning which is not unusual for her and her blood sugar was 117 this morning.

                                                A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 80-year-old, female patient who suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia).                                                                                                                      The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided/unknown by the reporter.    On 01-FEB-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 007M20A)  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 01-MAR-2021, the patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Batch number: 023M20A) in her left (dominant) arm.   On 02-MAR-2021, she experienced a side effect which was not listed in the sheet she was given. She wanted to call and report the side effect. She said that she was at the stove cooking and suddenly felt very weak and felt that her vision started to flip. She called for her husband to come over who seated her on a chair. After that she says she doesn&#39;t remember what happened, but her husband told her that her whole body was shaking, her head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds. When she came back, she could hear a rushing sound coming out of her left ear. She was also drenched in perspiration. She felt very nauseated and cold the whole afternoon.  On 03-MAR-2021 she felt better. She had a low grade fever of 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events, suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia) was considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.   The out come of the event, head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I understand that there may or may not be a link between my mother&#39;s symptoms and the vaccine, but I want to make sure that it is looked into.  Three days after dose, my mother woke up with shortness of breath.  Over the last week, the shortness of breath has lingered and she has also had stomach issues.   She has now been hospitalized since yesterday.  These are not uncommon symptoms with her, but she  has definitely been worse since the vaccine.  Assuming she recovers, I am concerned about her taking the second dose, scheduled in two weeks.  Her symptoms are very similar to those of a Physician in an article I read today.

She went to bed, and all night and into the next day had fever/chills.  She got up during the night to get some water she collapsed and could not get up as she was so weak.  Her husband found her and helped her back to bed.  Today, 2/22/21 she is better today and feels almost to normal.   She took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea.   Tylenol/Ibuprofen did not take the headache, but it did finally go away.   The headache was on the top of her head.

When we were going home they told me I was swerving, all over the road and they told me to stop, they would drive, I said no, i don&#39;t trust anyone with my car. We got home, I remember changing into my nightgown and was texting someone and I suddenly I stopped. After that I was unresponsive. I would not answer anyone, they said I looked pale and stared into the air. They called my children and they came and emergency personnel was called. I was taken to a hospital and they transferred me to another hospital. I stayed there for 3-4 days. After going home it took me some days to be able to walk without assistance. I wanted to say I had covid in May (1st time) and September (2nd time) . I still do not have taste or smell back from the covid. I can only eat 3 or 4 bites and then I am done.

                                                Patient reported feeling weak, fatigue, fever (102), and loss of appetite. Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine I had racing heartbeat for 2 hours. I was short of breath over the next few days. I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

It is hard to describe.  I did not think I could drive home safely, so I sat back down and told the girl. She let me sit quietly and than took my blood pressure which was either 185 or 189.  She let me rest and then took it again.  This time it was 167.  I left there about 8:30a.m., came right home and went to bed.  Got up after a long nap and B.P. was 165/82 61 at 6:45p.m. My face is still flushed, have chills and slight headache, took aspirin.  At 9:45 B.P. was 150/92 64, felt the same.

Back in the middle of February the patient had a high-grade small-bowel obstruction ended up with laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.  She was extremely deconditioned.  She came to swing bed here and states here for about 2 weeks.  She thought she was ready to go home and be successful at that time.  Unfortunately, she has gotten home and found that she can barely take care of herself.  She is extremely deconditioned.  She thinks she just needs to be built up for another week or 2 and then could be very successful at home.  She does have a friend that is helping her, but is worried about getting so weak that she end up hurting herself.  I saw her yesterday in the office and thought that another swing bed stay a might be in order.

                                                The patient received her FIRST dose of Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/26/21 and SECOND dose on 2/23/21. On 3/8, she first started to experience shortness of breath, which was attributable to cardiac etiology and diastolic heart failure at the time, but which in retrospect may have been her earliest symptom of new onset myasthenia gravis, which is the AE I am wanting to report. She was hospitalized from 3/8-3/13, and underwent extensive cardiac workup that was negative. She again developed shortness of breath on 3/17/21 and was re-admitted to the hospital on 3/18/21 for diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure exacerbation, received diuresis from 3/18-3/22/21 but then developed new onset diplopia, at which pint I evaluated her in neurological consultation on 3/22. Her brain MRI disclosed an UNrelated incidental  small left cerebellar infract, but her neurological exam showed a new R lateral rectus palsy and new moderate to severe left eyelid ptosis, suspicious for myasthenia gravis. Anti-acetylcholineseterase antibodies--- binding, blocking, and modulating, were all sent off and came back all strongly positive on 3/26-27/21. The patient then called stating she had developed recurrent shortness of breath, new onset dysphagia, and worsening double vision. I urgently re-evaluated her in outpatient follow-up in my office on 4/2/21 and sent her immediately to the hospital to be readmitted, where she remains as of this reporting date and she has been receiving IVIG with improvement in her symptoms. She did NOT have any previous known history of eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, diplopia, or muscle weakness. In retrospect, the patient states that her current symptomatology began around 3/7/21 with the benefit of hindsight. I am reporting this event because it is very unusual for an 82 year old WOMAN to develop new onset of myasthenia gravis, and it is a known autoimmune disease, and a vaccine would be a plausible trigger for its development, or trigger for its first symptomatic manifestation. I was also especially concerned because my fellow neurologist, ALSO had a patient develop myasthenia gravis about 2 weeks or so following their second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. It would be an EXTRAORDINARY coincidence for two instances of new onset myasthenia gravis to occur 2 weeks post- vaccination at essentially the same time in an institution of our size, so we both felt obliged to report both cases ASAP to the VAERS. I was not able to reach the patient in her hospital room today to get additional specifics about where she got the vaccine, its lot number etc., however she is a retired and has indicated her willingness to provide you with any and all additional information you need, and I am also personally very willing to provide any additional information about her eventual outcome.

I became extremely weak, I started vomiting, my blood pressure was 196/117 BP, and I was sweating. My grandson called 911 and  I was taken to the hospital Cardiologist said heart was fine. I did NOT have a heart attack. He thinks it is due to the vaccine. Advised that I take the second shot.

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Treatment information included was acetaminophen for headache. The patient was hospitalized with coivd in January and had 5 days of Remdesivir. The patient also had problem with a lymph node in that arm. She had a Lumpectomy. They took at a lymph node in the left side of that armpit to see if it had spread. It was sensitive when she had a breast exam and was sent to get a mammogram. Got the breast exam last week in February.

                                                The injection did sting, but didn&#39;t think anything about it. For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

                                                Bad headache, very stuffy nose, I couldn&#39;t breathe and almost went to the hospital. Ears were ringing, my eyes were ready to pop out of my head. Temples hurt, lymph glands were swollen, sore throat. Mostly in upper part of anatomy above collar bone. It made me very weak, I had trouble getting out of rocking chair to answer phone. So I took another Tylenol. I usually only take 1-2 Tylenol a day and that was my second one by the middle of the day. I had to lay down and I live alone so I was nervous and had phone beside me and debated calling 911 which I have never done. I dozed and when I woke up about a couple of hours later it was much better. Still had headache and a little stuffiness but anybody can handle that. Also, I was very nauseated and couldn&#39;t eat but I did drink water.

The following day she woke up with a headache, some nausea but nothing came up.  She also had diarrhea and her arm was sore.  She felt weak, and since she had COVID she has had shortness of breath.   She stayed in the bed all day unless she had to as her arm felt like it was made of metal and was extremely tired.  She was moving around upstairs and somewhere around 8:00 PM she went to the bathroom, was sweating profusely and wiping herself with tissue, and apparently turned out the light and apparently passed out as she woke up on the floor in the hallway and could not get up right away.   She could not use the left arm, was able to get herself up with the help of the door to stand on her feet.  She walked into her room and sat on the bed, and did not lay back down and greatful that she did not fall down the steps.  She went back to bed, but in the morning she was terrified and her family heard her talking to the doctor on call who told her to go to the ER.  In the ER they told her that she had syncope, seen by Dr. at Health Care.  She was admitted at 11:11 AM on 2/27/21.  She was given IV, had a CAT scan of her head, told her that it did not reveal any blood.  After several hours they discharged her.  She called her doctor and she has an appointment tomorrow morning.   She is feeling tired, not sleeping well.

In addition, I had wheezing and a feeling of &#34;bubbles&#34; in my chest. My arm was very hot and tender at the injection site.  I slept through the rest of the night but awoke feeling extremely weak and confused. As a result, I spent the day in bed. I had no appetite, as well. The next day, I had coughing bouts off and on and still don&#39;t feel myself.

She was eating breakfast after at home and complained to a neighbor that her teeth hurt and she was nauseated after eating. In the afternoon, she felt dizzy and had diarrhea accompanied with blood. Close to 9 PM, her son went to check on her. The patient was found on the floor--she was unresponsive and had purple lips. Her son called an ambulance and started chest compressions. The patient passed away at the hospital. The doctor has ordered an autopsy, and the results are pending.

                                                The morning after vaccine was administered my mother woke up in the morning blacked out resulted in a fall on her left arm that caused a fractured clavicle. The dizziness and vertigo continue through the day Along with chills and nausea throughout the day. My biggest concern was the dizziness which has never happened before. I took her to the emergency room which resulted in a diagnosis of a fractured and displaced clavicle . The dizziness was the most concerning part and they ruled out any cerebrovascular causes. A meclizine 25 mg was given and also prescribe for her when she was discharged. I am a registered pharmacist and is a healthcare provider I looked into the side effects listed. Vertigo and dizziness is not commonly communicated as a adverse effect. This is so concerning for the elderly patients regarding  potential falls which can lead to fractures and be detrimental to their health.That?s exactly what happened to my mother

I very suddenly became light-headed and felt like I could pass out .  I sat down on a chest and put my head down on the foot of the bed and hoped it would pass.  About a minute later I became very nauseated and thought I would vomit.  I  waited about 15 min and did not do so.   I went back to bed and stayed quiet for the rest of the night.  The 24th I was extremely tired and slept most of the day.  When I did get up briefly I ached all over.  This gradually ceased by the next day.   These symptoms did not return. I am very active and know no other reasons for the reaction.

By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

                                                At 11:30 pm the patient, my mother, experienced extreme rapid heart beat, pain in her chest and neck, and  nausea. She stated it was intense and severe but can&#39;t say how long it lasted.  She was about to call 911 when her symptoms subsided.  She fell asleep and didn&#39;t tell anyone until the next day.  She has felt ok since then but we will be following up with a doctor next week.

She had a hard time sitting up, trying to lift her arms, had a hard time articulating how she felt and what was wrong, her speech seemed a little slurred, and she felt nauseated. Her daughter denied facial droop and localizing weakness. She continued to be &#34;out of it&#34; and weak until her daughter put her in bed about 7 hours later. She slept well and got up twice during the night to use the bathroom and seemed ok. She is feeling better today. Pt reports she kept hearing the telephone ringing all night and thought she heard someone yelling about the phone.

                                                She got sick, pain in the arm and neck the day after the vaccine.  I called her doctors office on the 19th of Feb and I did not get a call back.   She was sick to her stomach, really tired and lost her appetite.   On the 22nd I called her doctor again... no response, on the 23 I called again.  On the 24th finally someone spoke to me.. they stated they had called my mom and spoke with her.  They are suppose to call me, my mom could not remember by the time she would hang up.  They said to let her rest and give her electrolytes and Vit. B6.  On the 26th when I called the doctor and said she is lethargic they said to take her to the ER.  She flat lined at the hospital and her body went into shock.  She ended up having Kidney, Heart and Liver Failure.  She was still driving and doing all of her cooking, banking, shopping, showering, walking every day on Feb 18th.  She died on March 5th.

                                                She was fine the first day, on Wednesday she noticed her arm was red, and had difficulty breathing, but has COPD and used her medications.  About 5:00 PM her mouth started watering and she got the drive heaves, and then about 15 minutes and then started having them bad.  She laid down and after 15 minutes she could not breath, couldn&#39;t get any air.  When she was able to get some air, her throat was sore and she was really hoarse.  Later in the evening she laid down again and the breathing difficulty happened again and it was worse.  She was scared to the point that she was afraid to lie down.   She is fatigued.  She finally fell asleep during the night and didn&#39;t sleep much and today is very tired.  She called her doctor this morning, and talked to the nurse.   They told her if it got worse to go to the ER.  Told her to call the CDC.

                                                Received call from patient on 3/3/2021. She reports that approximately 1.5hrs after receiving her COVID vaccine, she began having pain in the top of her head, neck, between her shoulder blades, down both arms to her fingertips, and down her spine.  Reports also began having swelling in her feet. Reports having nausea and pain in her chest with walking. She reports she already had trouble with ambulation prior to vaccine, but it has been worse since receiving the vaccine. She reports as of 3/3/21, the pain is still occurring and not getting better.  She has not seen her primary doctor since being vaccinated. I encouraged her to speak with her doctor or schedule a visit with them as her pain is not improving.

                                                Got shot on Wed. 2/10/2021. Started feeling ill within a few hours. Next day, was &#34;sick&#34; and needed to vomit (but didn&#39;t).  Temperatures for 3 days was less than normal.  95.6 to 96.1.  FridayI I started vomiting and had incidents of a pain in my stomach area and by that night became sicker and dehydrated.  Was so sick I couldn&#39;t get out of bed to get water (I live alone).  By midnight Friday (12:00) Feb. 13 I was so sick I called daughter to take me to hospital.  Went to ER and then did blood work.  Blood work showed  liver enzymes were over 500 and eventually reached over 600, when normal is under 100.  Was admitted to hospital.  My electrolytes were out of &#34;whack&#34; too.  My doctor told me in 11 years practice she had never seen a liver enzymes reading over 600.  I am scared to take another vaccine shot at this point.  Note:  I had blood work done Friday, March 5, 2021 and my liver enzymes was 26 -- normal but I am not interested in getting that sick again and I have concerns about my liver.

                                                Though patient was experiencing pain due to her arthritis, soon after the vaccination (1-2 hours) she experienced increased knee pain in both legs. Since the vaccination, she has also had bad diarrhea. Lastly, the worst symptom she experienced was light headedness and fatigue. At around 8:30pm on the day of the vaccination, she got up from dinner to go to bed a bit early. She was feeling tired and started to fade. She fell backwards against the wall, hit her head and landed on her bottom. Thankfully, I was there to help her up and was able to stay up with her to ensure she didn&#39;t have a concussion. Admittedly, she did not drink much water that day so it&#39;s possible this exacerbated the side effects of the vaccine. Maybe the clinics can offer people water bottles or other hydrating beverages to ensure things like this don&#39;t happen?

                                                On 2/1/2021, the patients daughter, who claims is a nurse, reported this incident to me.  She stated that the evening after the patient received the vaccine, she felt some mild injection site pain.  The morning after, the patient reported severe abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting.  The patients daughter then called her physician to report these symptoms and attributed them as an adverse reaction to the vaccine at that time.  These symptoms were intermittent for one week and no other adverse reactions were noted.  In the early morning hours of 1/27/2021, the patient was toileting and had expired while doing so.  An ambulance was called and cause of death was not found. An autopsy was not performed.

                                                throat closure three weeks after second dose; has lost the ability to swallow.; hernia; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning an 88-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced throat closure three weeks after second dose/obstruction, hernia, and lost ability to swallow/dyphagia.  The patient&#39;s medical history included an aortic valve replacement. Concomitant medications were not provided by the reporter.   On 13 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 01120A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 10 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 007M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection  On an unknown date, the patient had lost the ability to swallow. Patient was taken to the ER and ER doctors thought it was a hernia and suggested a surgery. This was three weeks post dose of the vaccine. The reporter reported that the patient was taken to the hospital on 4 Mar 2021. The doctor diagnosed hernia, but they didn&#39;t explain the throat closing. They told him to take the patient to a GI doctor. The GI didn&#39;t think it was necessary to do a surgery and scheduled a colonoscopy.  The reporter disagreed with the colonoscopy because it didn&#39;t address the throat swelling. The hospital had put the patient on IV fluids but didn&#39;t have a lot of answers. On 8 Mar 2021, the hospital prescribed antibiotics and speech therapy.   Treatment activities reported by the reporter included IV fluids, antibiotics, and speech therapy .  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of events, obstruction, hernia, and dysphagia were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events were consistent with increased risk of complications associated with elderly age of patient. Company assessed the events to be unlikely related to company product.

Came home, did not feel bad, day and half later started feeling bad, as  well as kind of like a cold with drainage to her throat, a little coughing.  Has had diarrhea for the last 3 days, nausea and generally feeling bad.  The first week had a lot of drowsiness, had fogginess as far as thinking.   The first few days took Tylenol and did not take anymore as her daughter said it contained aspirin for the pain.  Still having the headache, feeling like she is not thinking real good.  About a month ago had blood work and everything was perfect, no problems.  Due to the fact that she is still having these reactions 2 weeks from the injections wanted to report it.

Patient verbally reported to me that about 4 hours after the shot, she began experiencing severe shocks all over her face and into her left neck and chest area.  This quickly worsened to include her left arm.  That all resolved after a nap.  But when she woke up, and went to the mirror, she noted that her left face was slow and drooping.  She went to the ER.  It was noted that she was having a severe problem with swallowing.  She also was noting severe pain in left external ear canal.  She had obvious severe breakout in the left ear canal - and the immediate area.  She was sent home - and came to my office the next day.  By that time, the symptoms had become much much worse.  She was unable to swallow.  The outbreak in the left ear was much more pronounced.  And her entire left face and left tongue were paralyzed.  She was diagnosed with the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome - she was unable to talk or swallow.  She was readmitted back into the hospital.
