                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

I decided to take cold-warm shower, and Metamizole 1mg. The fever went down a couple of hours after. I continued with the medication the next day for the headache. At night of the next day, I had nausea. Three days after the shot, I have not taken any more medications, no more fever, sore arm, nor nausea, but still have a mild headache.

Fast forward to 1-6-2021 I started getting a reaction at injection site which consisted of being swollen, red, a hard knot under the red area, really warm and sensitive to touch. I also have pain going up the left side of my neck and down my armpits/lymph nodes.

I have a history of  inflamed lymph nodes that occurs 1-2 times a year under the arm and in the groin, and this felt similar to those episodes. The lymph node is hard to touch and the sensitivity continues today. Today (1/13/2020), I noticed an inflamed, red patch of skin that is hot to touch over the region where the injection occurred. Additionally, I have experienced diarrhea 1-2x/day for the past two days.

Then during the night at 1 a.m. I woke up and the same feeling of numbness was happening in both my left arm and leg. This then shifted to my right side, then just to my hands and feet. During this I was also experiencing the noted Covid vaccine side effects of fever, chills, headache, body ache, weakness, and nausea.

                                                Since 1/16/2021, starting in the late afternoon, I would go to the bathroom every few hours due to diarrhea, even when I?ve only drunk water for an afternoon. Even with water, the fluid only came out from my rectum with some wet and loose stools, the stool coming out as if liquid and not a solid. Even woke me up early morning to go to the bathroom.

                                                Extremely intense headache that lasted approximately 10 hours. Headache caused nausea, sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound.  I took naproxen 500mg and 1000mg tylenol and neither did anything for the pain.  I also tried ice and heat, neither of which helped with the pain either. Pain reached intensity of 7.5/10.  This was by far the worst headache I&#39;ve ever experienced.

Later that morning I was light headed, fatigued, sore throat, nausea. The fever continued to increase. By 2200 that day my fever was 104.7 and that was with Tylenol on board. I also iced my groins and axillary areas to help cool my body. Today is the second day out from the vaccine and I have recovered from the fevers. My fever early this morning was still 102.5 but has since passed and I am normothermic. I am very fatigued with some chest pains.

Important to note that I did NOT have facial weakness or drooping. Was advised to not get the 2nd dose of vaccine. Did not receive any prescription medications. Facial paresthesia resolved within two days.

At approximately 1:00 AM, I started experiencing a fever (101.3 F), chills, aches, and some heart palpitations. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen, which helped to reduce the fever and chills.  When I woke up, I was nauseous, had a serious headache, fatigue, minor chills, a fever (101.3 F) and more noticeable heart palpitations (when measured with my smartwatch, it reported bpm of 118-124). I had a virtual consult with a physician who advised me to be seen by urgent care immediately.

                                                At 3am (Wednesday) the following day after my shot, I began having chills and a fever. My fever started at 100.5 and continued through out the entire day, reaching 102. degrees Fahrenheit. At the same time I was extremely weak and could hardly walk. I had a pounding headache and could not sit up. I had to lay down. I was very nauseous and couldn&#39;t eat much. I was dizzy and couldn&#39;t even look at my phone. at 9pm on Wednesday I was able to finally eat a substantial meal and finally took some Tylenol. Around 10:30pm my headache lessened and I was able to sit up. My temperature was around 99 degrees. I went to bed, then woke up at 1am (Thursday) freezing again with chills, then the sweats. By 3:45am I was able to sleep until 7am. 7am on Thursday morning my temperature was normal (98.6) but my head was hurting. I had some weakness but was able to stand long enough to shower. The biggest symptom I had all day Thursday was a lot of body aches. Mostly in my hips and back, but all over. My right arm was also extremely red and swollen. Wednesday and Thursday I stayed home from work. Friday I returned to work, but I had a headache, would get over heated easily and had body aches. This is when the injection site and surrounding area began itching. Saturday I had a stomach ache and head ache and continued to feel sluggish. I did not move around much and was exacerbated trying to grocery shop. Sunday I had pressure in my head (top of the head) especially when I would bend down.  It is now Monday. My headache has cleared but my arm remains itchy, though there is no sign of swelling or redness. I do not have a history of Chronic Migraines and I have not had a cold/the flu in over a year.

Pain extends from wrist to metacarpals of bilateral hands; pain does not extend to joints in phalanges. Arthralgia is still present today, right has subsided slightly and L hand has increased slightly. Pain over the last two weeks has been significant enough that I cannot type or hold a phone with my R hand. Treated with ibuprofen with no relief.   2/1: Working in COVID ICU for first time since vaccine. At 1700, intense headache developed and hot flashes. That evening, I felt body aches, fever (unable to take temp at home, probably low grade), swollen tonsils, slight nausea, headache, joint pain, and continued arthralgia. Symptoms present on 2/2 but less intense. 2/3 persistent headache, body aches at times, joint aches at times, continued arthralgia. Today 2/4 slight body aches at times, continued arthralgia, though it is starting to subside in R hand.

                                                Roughly 10 hours after receiving the 2nd Moderna covid vaccine my hand turned red and swollen bilaterally and from the 2nd knuckle down to the end of the fingers they were completely pale and the nails began turning blue. The change in color was a very defined straight line border. It was not painful and there was no numbness or tingling. I had not been outside or done anything involving a change of temperature. Along with my second dose I also experienced severe chills/shivering , nausea, sweating, fatigue, and body aches. These also happened with the first dose. The change in color to my hands lasted about 2 hours. There does not seem to be any lingering issues since then.

Both symptoms seemed to have faded before I left the monitoring area. Proceeded to drive home (20 minute drive) and nausea returned, as well as increasing pressure and pain in chest. I decided to turn around and go back to the urgent care clinic. Arrived back at clinic by 0900am. Pressure in chest had receded but there was still some aching/occasional sharp chest pains and nausea. Clinic referred me to the ED for further workup. Most symptoms had stopped by 1000am when I went to the ED.

As soon as I felt queezy I passed out. I woke up they said within about 30 seconds and had full body sweats. Stomach ache, dizzy and head was tingly like I would pass out again. My calfs hurt like they had previously had muscle cramps. I went to ER, blood and urine tests were fine, heart and blood pressure was fine. Dr said he did not believe it was an allergic reaction, and that it was a stress response. I am not sure if it is because I had COVID in December.

                                                About 7:00 am - fatigue and chills, muscle aches. Starting around noon, my fever was getting higher and higher - to 103. At 2:00 pm, I tried to sit up in my bed - I proceeded to throw up and faint. I contacted doctor to see if I should take anything. I took an ibuprofen and drank fluid - but didn&#39;t drink as much as normal because of nausea. I was nauseated all day. It stayed about 102 until about 8:00 pm. At about 10:00 pm that night, I started feeling a bit better. The next day fever was 99.7 and with more ibuprofen it normalized to 98.6. If I didn&#39;t take ibuprofen for awhile it went back up to 99. something so I had to keep taking ibuprofen for the rest of that third day. Fourth day - mild fatigue and muscle aches. Everything was normal other than that. Fatigue and muscle aches were gone about Friday morning.

I switched to over heated quickly and vomited. At this point I had a severe head ache. For about the next 38 hours, I had no appetite, severe body aches and head ache and nausea. After that period (as of now), not really having any symptoms besides a slightly sore throat.

                                                I first started feeling very cold around 5:00 PM that day. Once I went home I went to sleep around 10:30 and work up at 2:30 AM with vomiting and 8/10 epigastric pain that radiated to my back. I went to the hospital. They gave me morphine and Zofran but within 5 minutes of the first dose of morphine, my pain returned even more intense and I still vomited 20 minutes after the Zofran. So they pushed another Morphine and Zofran. Zofran helped at this point but the Morphine did not. At this point they gave my three different oral liquids to help calm down my epigastric region, including mylanta, lidocaine and a third medication. I went home and slept the rest of the day but Wednesday night I got diarrhea and spike a fever of 102.7 around 8PM. Now it&#39;s thursday morning and I still have a 2/10 epigastric pain, physically exhausted and had a fever this morning as well.

                                                Starting with just 5 hours after the vaccine, I had a slight fever which reached up to 99.6F and began to have some nausea. I was able to eat, and I took Tylenol throughout the night, then had a fever the following morning of 99.9. Took more tylenol and was fatigued. Fever reached up to 100.3 during the day, took more Tylenol.  Just over 24 hours later, I noticed a large local injection site reaction on left arm where vaccine was administered. I felt it and it was a big bump on arm at injection site, intense pain and warmth at location.  This location had much inflammation and about 7cm in diameter for the lesion. I immediately started putting ice on the location for a few hours and also took some Advil.  I alternated with that and continued to take Tylenol and woke up during the night with a fever of 100.5, had night sweats. Woke up with a fever the next day again, but no more fever throughout the day after this. The lesion continued with pain at sight, and lesion has started to itch. It is 4 days after reaction appeared, and the inflammation and swollenness has now subsided. The location remains itchy, no more fever.

I ended up throwing up around 4 am on Thursday 12/31/20 at work. Then over the weekend I  felt very lethargic, had body aches, and the hot flashes continued. My left arm hurt as expected, but the soreness went up into the left side of my neck as well. Today (1/3/21) is the first day since I got the vaccine where I no longer have a headache and feel basically back to baseline.

I could hardly walk. In addition to this, I felt like I had the flu. Headache, fatigue, hot flashes, coughing. I vomited once in the evening. I received the vaccine on Friday, and Saturday was my worst day. I felt a bit better on Sunday, and back to normal on Monday.

I had nausea, chills, felt very lethargic and sore to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand at work, and had a pounding headache.  The site where I got the vaccine was also more tender and sore than usual after a vaccination.  I left work early around 3 pm, took 400 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and tried to get as much sleep as I could.  By 6 am on 1/13/21, all these symptoms had gone away, but now I&#39;ve noticed a very swollen lymph node just above my left clavicle.

                                                At 9:00 PM yesterday I had full body chills, body aches, and nausea. At 11:00 PM a fever of 100.4. About 20 minutes later my fever went up to 101.6. At this time I took Tylenol. With the fever came a head ache. My injection sight is very painful. I did not sleep very well. When I woke up at 7:00AM my fever was 100 degrees. It has stayed at 100 degrees until this point (1:30 PM). My headache became painful enough that I took 2 excedrin that have relieved most of the headache. My symptoms are improving as the day progresses. My injection site is still very painful. With the normal flu vaccine I get yearly I have never had any problems.

I pulled over to wait it out and my throat swelling got worse.

Had a very restless sleep and woke up with severe sweating around 3 AM. Woke up at 9:30 AM with severe, pounding headache. Attempted to walk around at 10 AM, pounding headache was a 10/10 pain scale when upright. Nausea set in as soon as I was standing, ran to lay down to avoid vomiting. At 10:30 AM I sat up attempted to drink water and the vomiting began. Severe vomiting for about 30 minutes, then intermittent vomiting throughout the day until 6 PM. Headache did not let up all day, no response to medication (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, rizatriptan, magnesium). Headache subsided around 8 PM and  I was able to sleep. No symptoms today 1/22/21.

These symptoms lasted for about 20 minutes and then they resolved. I did not have any of these symptoms since it initially happened on 1.8.21 at 230am. I did not seek medical care at the time since my symptoms resolved. I did contact my doctor on 2.1.2021 about this and he stated the symptoms I described aligned with symptoms of a panic attack, but if I felt it was related to the vaccine that I can report it.

At around 2AM, I had vasovagal syncope (I lost consciousness and then woke up covered in sweat). Directly after I regained consciousness, I vomited several times over the next couple of minutes. I drank water and took Tylenol to try and alleviate symptoms. After that, I no longer vomited or lost consciousness but I continued to feel feverish, had a severe headache, fatigue, chills off and on, nausea, and muscle and joint pain until around 4PM on 2/24/21.

He states I was unconscious for 10-15 seconds. After I wake up my headache and nauseous went always. I was fine the whole day.

Then about 3 hours after I received the vaccine I started having nausea and some hand tingling on and odd. The biggest limiting symptom was the excruciating shoulder pain on the left arm, no relief with ibuprofen, Tylenol, ice, changing position nothing. Worse pain I had in my life. I could not move my arm on its own at all and it was excruciating pain. Went to the ER and they gave me IV fluids and tramadol. The pain was better after that but I still could not move the arm and the pain was still present. They made me follow up with my PCP. I saw my PCP on a Tuesday after being on and off the phone with them on a Mondays.  Symptoms have improved but not back to normal.

I have not felt any major symptoms or side effects aside from pain at the injection site. This afternoon I noticed how sore my arm was and started looking up potential side effects of the vaccine to see how long I should expect pain. I was trying to practice lifting my sore arm and then started feeling light headed. My vision went blurry, my hearing was muffled, and I started to feel like I was going to faint and/or vomit. I tried drinking water to see if that would help and when it didn&#39;t I called over to my coworker to tell her I felt like I was going to pass out. She informed our boss, who called Employee Health. They both walked me downstairs to Employee Health.&#34;

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Dose 1  One hour after receiving injection- light headed, dizzy, trembling, hot flashes, extreme nausea, confusion, hard time speaking, skin numbness and tingling at injection site and on face/neck/arms. Took Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Acute symptoms dissipated after a couple hours. Continued to feel dizzy when standing/walking. Confusion/short term memory loss of entire afternoon evening (told by others- can?t remember actions, repeating myself and not remembering, can?t remember conversations). About two hours after injection, extreme muscle pain in left arm. Couldn?t lift or move arm and hurt even when not moving, took 440mg naproxen. Brought pain down to a more normal feeling of post shot soreness.

                                                Sudden extreme fatigue and mild nausea for about 2 hours. Then felt tachycardia and palpitations. Heart rate was checked by medical professional in household and was found to be 120 and irregular. This lasted approximately 2 minutes. At this time also felt shortness of breath which lasted 30 minutes. Once the tachycardia and shortness of breath ended, I was getting chills and continued to have nausea and extreme fatigue. Since the vaccination my arm has continued to be very sore. When I woke up on 1/8/2021 I am still very fatigued and still have a sore arm.

I required epinephrine and diphenhydramine. Approximately 3.5hrs following the first dose of epinephrine / diphenhydramine, I had a rebound reaction and new dysphagia and went to the emergency department where I required another dose of epinephrine, IV famotadine, IV diphenhydramine, IV dexamethasone, and IV odanestron to bring the symptoms under control.   No local reaction at the injection site. Angioedema, urticaria, and dysphagia were all solely focused to the head, face, and mouth.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning her co-worker, a 28 year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced anaphylaxis reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Dec 2020, within five minutes of vaccine administration, the patient experienced anaphylaxis reaction. The patient had symptoms of throat tightness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and increased heart rate. Treatment for the event included an epinephrine pen  On 29 Dec 2020, the nurse reported that the patient was still having some of the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and weakness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, anaphylaxis reaction, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the event, anaphylaxis reaction, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred apparently 5 min after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# unknown) vaccine administration. She was treated with epinephrine pen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:40 am on January 8th, 2021. My arm was a little sore that night, but nothing too bad. I took some ibuprofen before I went to bed (400mg, I think). I felt fine the morning of January 9th; I went and bought some groceries and then took a walk in the neighborhood. I did get pretty chilled while walking since it was so cold. When I got back to my apartment around 2:00 I took a nap, then took a very hot shower trying to get warm again. Around 3:00 pm my arm started to become noticeably more sore so I took ibuprofen (600mg). Between 3:15 pm and 3:30 pm I suddenly started to feel warm and nauseous. I felt light-headed and while I was upright (standing or moving around) I would get some black spots in my vision. I went and lay down around 4:00 pm. I stayed in bed that whole evening with a fever (at its highest, 102), I was pretty nauseous, my arm hurt to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it and my wrist and hand felt very weak. I took some more ibuprofen (maybe another 600mg?) sometime after 8:00pm. The next day, Sunday January 10th, I mostly stayed in bed and ran a light fever (99.9) and was very fatigued. Arm was very sore and I had limited use of it until the latter part of the day. Monday, January 11th, I felt mostly fine, I could use my arm with no issue, but I stayed home from work due to the fatigue. By Tuesday I was fairly normal, just tired.

                                                I am a MD student who got the first dose of the moderna vaccine on 1/4/2021. I had no immediate reaction other than arm soreness. A couple weeks after my first vaccine, I had a reaction when drinking miralax. Within ~5 minutes of having a few sips of a 17g solution, I had throat tingling/tightening, sense of impending doom, cough, dyspnea, nausea, fecal urgency, and intense chills with shivering. I stopped drinking the solution and my symptoms eventually resolved on their own (the chills and nausea took the longest, about 1.5 hours) - I didn&#39;t even think to take benadryl because it wasn&#39;t clear to me at the time if I was really having an allergic reaction (no hives, no vomiting - but in retrospect I&#39;m concerned). I&#39;ve had miralax in the past without any issues. I&#39;ve never had a vaccine adverse reaction. I have no history of atopy.

                                                In the evening of the same day (Monday around 7 pm), I began to feel severe fatigue and soreness at the injection site along with moderate muscle aches. At about 9 pm I felt chills and decided to take a warm bath. After the bath, I was not able to warm up and began shivering, the muscle aches increased as well. I took my temperature with a digital thermometer which read 102 degrees.  At around 11 pm I then experienced nausea and vomiting which continued until 3 am that same night. By Tuesday morning, all symptoms had decreased from severe to moderate, and no longer febrile. At night my fever rose again to 99.8 degrees with some mild nausea. The soreness at the injection site remained between moderate to severe with new pain at my underarm (same arm of injection). Today, Wednesday morning I continue to have pain and sensitivity on my underarm and at the injection site.

The patient&#39;s medical history included anxiety and allergy to latex. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 12-Jan-2021, 15 minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received one of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (026L20A) intramuscularly in an unknown injection site for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   12-Jan-2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced a severe allergic reaction which made her face puffy, red, and covered with hives.  She took 50 mg of diphenhydramine.  She was also having trouble pronouncing words because her tongue was swelling and she couldn&#39;t swallow water, so she used epinephrine  and go to the emergency room.  On 14 Jan 2021 she felt weak and tired.   On 13 Jan 2021follow up information was received and per source document/call -  In addition one day later, on 13Jan2021 around 5:30 pm, patient reported that she went to the bathroom and noticed that her &#34;face was still red&#34; and &#34;swollen&#34; and had a &#34;little bit of difficulty swallowing&#34; and took another unknown dose of Benadryl and felt better.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events,severe allergic reaction, difficulty swallowing, face was still red, swollen and felt weak and tired was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female with medical history of anxiety and allergy to latex who experienced serious medically significant unlisted event of severe allergic reaction described as her face puffy, red, covered with hives, tongue swelling and difficulty swallowing within 15 minutes after the first dose of the study medication administration (LOT:026L20A). Patient also experienced additional reported events of non-serious listed events of &#34;face was still red&#34; and &#34;feeling tired&#34; and non-serious unlisted events of &#34;face swollen&#34;, had a &#34;little bit of difficulty swallowing&#34;, and &#34;feeling weak&#34;. Patient was treated for the severe allergic reaction with initially Benadryl 50 mg and then with epinephrine pen and was sent to ER. Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the event of severe allergic reaction is possibly related to vaccine. Additional reported events of non-serious listed events of &#34;face was still red&#34; and &#34;feeling tired&#34; and non-serious unlisted events of &#34;face swollen&#34;, had a &#34;little bit of difficulty swallowing&#34; and &#34;feeling weak&#34; are possibly related to vaccine.

                                                Experienced chills, arm soreness, and fatigue initially, which worsened over the rest of the evening. Around 6:00 pm, I measured my temperature and it was 95.0 degrees Fahrenheit. I could not get warm for and experienced tingling and numbness in first my feet, then arms and hands, and finally my face. This passed and I was left feeling nauseous and still extremely cold. After tossing and turning for most of the night, so of these side effects have resolved, but I have a splitting headache and muscle and joint pain throughout my body. No treatment has been undertaken. Some side effects have resolved while others continue.

Thought she needed food, then got the headache and chills.  For the entire night she did have the cold chills.  She went to work the following day and her skin started feeling tingly.  By the time she got home on 2/3/21 she felt nauseous, had temp of 101.8.  The whole night she pretty much swim in sweat.  She went to work and was sent home due to the fever, nonstop sweating, and fatigue feeling like she was going to pass out.  Around 12:00 PM on 2/4/21 she couldn&#39;t keep anything down, she lost 5# since this vaccine.   She took an Ibuprofen 800 which didn&#39;t do much.  She took Pepto-Bismol, Advil and could not hold anything down.   The brain pounding headache that didn&#39;t want to go away yesterday.  She is still having a headache, she feels like every step she takes she has to use the restroom due to diarrhea episodes.  She has been at home trying to sleep through the symptoms and has not seen a doctor as when she called with her first vaccine reactions they did not have any information to tell her since the side effects are so new.  She only gets up today only when she has to use the restroom.  She has been in the bed since she went home on 2/3/21.

All of my skin, back and spine hurt, in the way that your body is sensitive and extra painful when you have a fever but I checked and I haven&#39;t had a fever yet. All of the day on 02/28/2021 I experienced skin and back pain, headache, fatigue, and brain fog (difficulty focusing and making decisions) as well as swollen and tender lymph nodes in my left armpit and under the left side of my jaw. On 03/01/2021 I woke up and felt better in the morning, I went for a walk around 3 pm and around 4 pm when I got back and sat down I started to experience headache, severe nausea which turned into chest pain and chest tightness and I still have swollen lymph nodes.

                                                Following the administration of the 1st dose I felt soreness on my arm. 2 hours later felt a sore throat, body aches, headache, fatigue set in.  No  skin reaction as of yet. The sore throat, body aches, and headaches resolved in 24 hrs.  The sore arm and fatigue persisted. 4 days after receiving the shot (1/4/21) I woke up to an itch on my right arm in the exact location where I received the vaccine. The itch persisted and grew over the following days. I also felt fatigue, soreness in my right side of my body and poor appetite throughout the week. The redness and swelling set in 1/7/21 a few days after first noticing the itch.  1/8/21 was the peak with the redness, swelling and itching being at its height. I spoke with my PCP on 1/8/21 who suggested I used an over the counter allergy medicine to treat the swelling. I took Claritin. The fatigue, soreness in my right side of my body and poor appetite continued until 1/10/21 when I began to feel more ok. The swelling, redness and itching is slowly resolving. Today 1/12 the area is not swollen, redness is very minimal and itching minimal as well.

I took Tylenol and Ibuprofen, and it took me 3 hours until I could have some relief and feel asleep. Chills fever and body aches I had for 3 days and it reached 100.7 on Christmas day. By Saturday no more fever but the pains were still there. Sunday I was fatigued and all those days I had pretty bad night sweats (about 5 nights). My nausea was so bad that one of the doctors I work with prescribed me some Phenergan that I took Christmas eve and day to help me be able to hold something in my stomach.

                                                After receiving the vaccination the same day I was nauseous all day. The very next day my face was slightly swollen in areas where I?ve had fillers in my lips and around my lips. Three days after the vaccination I woke up with my face completely swollen one eye was swollen shut and my upper lip was extremely heave and yet icing my face the swelling went down a lot about two weeks after the vaccination I started slowly losing taste but ONLY with salty foods.

                                                I received the first dose of the COVID 19 (Moderna) on 01/15/2021 in the evening. The next morning I woke up at 05:45am with a sore arm, which I was told was one of the side effect. However I was sore and aching all over my body. As my day continued, I became tired and feeling flushed within the face. I felt my heart rate beating faster than normal. I began having cold chills and the aching within my body progressed through out the day (12 hr shift). When I clocked out at 07:08 pm and got home from work, I was unable to hardly move with out hurting and I felt like I had a fever. My husband checked my temperature and I had a low grade temp of 99.4 with an increase work of breathing and had ,a difficult time catching a breath. My husband took me to the hospital ER and before arriving to the ER I was having a stridor episode and when the nurse checked my temperature it read 102.3. I could not complete a full sentence and began vomiting. I was given epinephrine nebulized, solumedrol, benadryl, zofran, lidocaine nebulized. I had a CT with contrast of my neck and a chest xray. All images came back normal, I had been treated for an allergic reaction from the COVID vaccine and discharged home once the symptoms and stridor subsided.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/19/2021 at my place of employment. Upon getting the vaccine approx 30 minutes after receiving i became very itcy, and my lips were burning/tingling. The itching continued to get worse, forming red rash on my chest. I called my MD at this point. I was told to take benadryl and to go to er if it became worse. I took benadryl. the itching continued for 2 days. i also experienced pain at injection site, headache, nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness. on 2nd day after vaccine i woke up and my muscles continued to be very sore. like i had just completed a marathon. I also have this sensation that started with the increased muscle pain. The only way i can explain it is that it feels like how a TENS unit feels, but its coming from the inside. especially in my back and thighs. this continues. i feel like i could just start shaking at any time. i cannot sleep but i am so tired. i was seen at dr today and i was told to report this to you guys. this sensation has not went away and has actually cause my muscles to spasming. MD said the vaccine effected my muscles and possibly neurologically as well.

Dizziness and severe nausea started and blood pressure decreased. Trouble concentrating and tingling in hands and feet. I was taken to the Emergency Room and hooked up to an IV and Heart Monitoring. I was given IV Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid, and Zofran. I was going to get an injection of Epinephrine but my heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly after the first batch of IV meds and they were concerned that the Epinephrine may have made things worse. I was monitored for 4 hours and then discharged with instructions to take Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for 5 days, Prednisone 60mg every day for 5 days, Pepcid 40mg twice a day for 5 days and given a prescription for an Epi-Pen. I remained very nauseous and dizzy foe the next 48 hours. My injection site became swollen, red, and tender 48 hours after my injection and then re-flared up 11 days after my injection on 01/17/21.

                                                Nausea, feverishness and chills started on Sunday morning, January 24th at around 2:30 AM. I was very pale and felt clammy, and the muscles in my upper arm, shoulder and neck were hurting more than just the normal ache from the shot. I had a hard time falling back asleep until I took more ibuprofen until the fever was gone. When the ibuprofen started to wear off I started to feel nauseous and fevered again, until I was able to take my next dose. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen every six hours for 24 hours to make the fever down to 99 degrees F. (My average body temperature is about 97.6 degrees F) At the time of this form I am still experiencing muscle pain, but it is more of a sore pain than the stabbing pain is had been on Sunday the 24th.

Around 1:00am on 1/23/21 I felt a stabbing pain at the site of injection as well as an aching numbness from my left shoulder down to my left pinky finger.  The morning of 1/23/21 I was weak and could barely walk, and I had a fever of 100.9. I got chills and would feel inexplicable cold and have goosebumps despite my fever. I had no appetite and was extremely fatigued. When sleeping on and off throughout the day I had extreme sweats and soaked my bedsheets. My muscles ached and touch was painful, even the spray of a shower felt painful.These symptoms continued until the early morning of Monday 1/25/21 which was the last time I experienced chills.

On Sunday 1/24/21-1/26 started with severe epigastric sharp upper abdominal pain, never had before. Was getting worse. Went to virtua ER on 1/26/21 evening, had ct scan with contrast showing fluid around galbladder and ultrasound showed wall thickening to 11mm, positive Murphy?s sign and fluid around galbladder. I was admitted overnight and surgeon had recommended removal due to ejection fraction of 12% from hida scan done on  1/27. Endoscopy was done also and was negative. Cholecysitis was the presumed diagnosis, with normal LFTS. I left and returned to ER where they did repeat ct scan showing distention , pain continued. Admitted for 1 night.  Pain was improving on Friday 1/29 , when I was discharged after repeated ultrasound showed resolved fluid. No history of any previous GI issues and no gallstones were noted on any imaging. I consume a healthy diet. Now having continued epigastric pain but improving.

                                                I started getting dizzy and slightly nauseated after about ten or fifteen minutes. The dizziness worsened after about 30 minutes but the nausea went away. About 30-40 minutes after the shot, my head got very foggy feeling, my limbs felt heavy and weak, and I suddenly became very tired. I don&#39;t have any trouble breathing and my heart rate is fine. I&#39;m just going to sleep it off and drink lots of water.

At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

Migraine symptoms were relieved in 2 hours but still experienced some side effects of the medication such as dizziness. I got my 2nd dose of Moderna at 18:10, 2/17/21. I started to experience tingling sensation in my head at 23:00. The tingling was unilateral in the left parietal and left occipital areas. On 2/18/21, I experienced dizziness, fatigue, general weakness, bad headaches, and nausea. I took Acetaminophen 600mg at 22:00, and symptoms were gone on 2/19/20. But my migraines were more frequent since vaccination, but i did not take any medication for that. Today (2/22/21), some post vaccination symptoms are back, including headache, dizziness, fatigue.

I started feeling itchy in that area as well. I started getting bumps all over. I took 2 puffs of my Symbicort, Benadryl, and Loratadine. I continued taking the Symbicort and Benadryl.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in my left deltoid, my mouth felt prickly and tasted metallic, my lips and tongue turned red and slightly swollen, along with swelling in my throat. After about 30 minutes the oral sensations improved, but my throat tightness increased. With some difficulty I swallowed a 25 mg capsule of diphenhydramine. Fifteen minutes after ingesting the capsule, the esophageal swelling improved slightly. Over the next 18 hours I continued taking 50 mg diphenhydramine every 4-6 hours. On 12/31/20 I no longer experienced any oral/esophageal swelling or abnormal sensations. However on 12/31/20 I developed severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, lasting through 1/3/21. I felt well January 4-6. However, on the evening of 1/6/21 I again developed  severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, persisting until 1/9/21. On 1/8/21 I additionally experienced pruritis and erythema on my left deltoid, this resolved spontaneously on 1/10/21.

I took Benadryl for my skin and was fine after about a hour. Exactly a week later the injection site was red/hot and itchy. The next day which is 1/19/21 same thing the injection site was hot red and itchy. I also felt chest tightness, headache, nausea and dizziness. I spoke with my doctor over the phone and she prescribed me Albuterol which helped with the chest tightness. I also took Benadryl for my arm which helped. The very next night 1/20/21 the same thing happened to my arm again. It got red and itchy and I felt nauseous.

At 9 hours post vaccination, also developed nausea, muscle/joint aches, fever, chills, and severe headache. Tmax was 102 F, but averaged at 100 F for at least 24 hours (11 PM 1/20/21 - 11 PM 1/21/21); cannot gauge what occurred after 11 PM on 11/21/21 due to sleep. However, right arm nerve pain continues now on to day 3 (1/22/21) with also the development of small wart-like bumps on left ring finger. Tmax today is 99.8 F accompanied by mild chills, nausea and abdominal pain.

As time past I started to get cold and began to get the chills. At this time I started taking my temperature which was running about 99-100F.  The chills became worse and I felt colder and sicker. My temperature climbed to 102.1 at which time I took some tylenol. My fever continued to climb to 103.1 within the next hour. The chills and fever lasted about 6-8 hours and then went away and I became very hot. I went to sleep that night after taking more tylenol just in case. The next morning I had severe fatigue, mild nausea  and a headache that stayed with me the rest of the day. I ended up going home from work due to the nausea and migraine type headache as well as intermittent chills that would come and go. By the next day 1/22 I was feeling much better over all. However a mildly painful red spot that was warm to touch appeared on my arm where the injection site was that stayed for the next 48 hours before disappearing.

                                                Patient is 30 y female who was 11 weeks pregnant with a singleton gestation EDC 8/10/2021. She received the first dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/14/2021. Over the ensuing 4 days, she experienced fevers to 99.3 F, a bumpy red rash accompanied by itching at the shot site, nausea, headache, and fatigue. Tylenol 500 mg/dose was used for temperature control. She then had two days of minimal symptoms, but on 1/21 experienced sudden swelling of her left arm at the shot site with rapid expansion of the rash. The rash was itchy and the arm was painful. She had a significant headache, fatigue, and temperature to 99.3 F.  These symptoms worsened over the next two days, with temperatures reaching 100 degrees F, continued headache, fatigue, and increased arm swelling.  On 1/23/2021 the arm began to improve, but fevers to 99.3, fatigue and headaches continued.  The rash had expanded to almost 12 cm x 6 cm. Tylenol 500 mg dosing was used for symptom control with some improvement.  By 1/26/2021 the rash had mostly disappeared, the headache was gone, fevers were gone, and the fatigue remained. In all, symptoms lasted 12 days post-vaccination.

It hurt really bad - couldn&#39;t left it or move it. I took Tylenol once or twice that day with six hours in between. I was a little bit drowsy and headache and a little bit nauseous.

First 5 day (Tuesday-Sunday) symptoms: swollen, sore, red, &amp; bruised arm at injection spot; body aches, joint  pain of knees, fatigue, no energy, loss of appetite, dry mouth, headache, chills, nausea.  I felt better on the 6th day (Sunday), the injection site looked like it was healing and going back to normal on my shoulder. Then on 7th day (Monday) my injection spot started to itch and break out in a huge hive and little hives around it.  It turned into a bright red circle around the injection spot.  It was hot to touch and very swollen. On 8th to current day (11th) my arm keeps getting worse with the swelling, hotness, itching, &amp; redness, and spreading down my arm.

                                                About 30 mins after receiving the vaccine I developed a strong headache while driving that affected my vision. Later that evening I got a stomach ache, the chills/hot flashes, arm soreness and the shakes. Most lasted until the following morning when I got up at 6:15am for work. The following morning I was only experiencing shakiness and arm soreness. About a week in a half later, I developed a rash at the injection site that looked like two large red blobs. The rash was slightly itchy and lasted only a couple of days.

                                                Body aches started 10 hours after 2nd COVID vaccine dose, but it was unclear if this was muscle soreness related to exercise. Slept poorly and awoke around 6 AM with distinct flu-like body aches and pounding headache, as well as sweatiness and feeling hot.  Took temperature at 9 AM and found no fever, but by this time the sweats had stopped. Took two ibuprofen 200 mg each at 7:15 am and symptoms reduced.  Felt weak all day and headache persisted, took ibuprofen twice more.  The following morning, about 45 hours after vaccine, awoke again with mild headache and nausea. Didn&#39;t vomit but nausea and weakness persist and haven&#39;t alleviated yet, I am submitting this at 11:30 AM, 50 hours after vaccine.

                                                I exclusively nurse my 2 month old baby and on Wednesday morning my son began to have hematemesis and coffee ground stool. He had it the morning of 1/20 and then again he spit up Frank red blood early morning of 1/21 and darkening stools. He continued to have hematemesis sporadically until midnight 1/21 when he stopped eating and went NPO. We took him to the ER per our pediatrician?s advice around 1pm on 1/21 and stayed overnight to do an endoscopy in the morning. His CBC and PTT were normal and the endoscopy showed stomach ulcers had developed. Biopsies were taken and culture for H. Pylori sent . Biopsies showed no pathology and h.pylori did not grow on culture. Currently, I have no explanation  for his stomach ulcer development and I feel that the close proximity to my first vaccination should be further evaluated.

Initial temperature was 99.6 (note: my normal temperature averages 96.8-97.8).  Temperature continued to escalate quickly and was accompanied by chills, body aches, and nausea initially. The highest temperature I recorded was 102.6 with a HR of 105-110. Tylenol PM was taken and fever was only reduced to 101.8. Vomiting occurred over night at 2:00 am on 2/3. Fever, chills, body aches, severe sweats, and fatigue continued into the next morning and I had another episode of vomiting. Temperature finally dropped to 99-100 around 2:00 pm on 2/3 and remained until at 6:00 pm when it was 98. Headache occurred that evening lasting through the morning of 2/4. Symptoms have mostly resolved.

At approximately 12:30 at night, I woke up due to the pain I was feeling all over my body (in particular in my joints and lower back). I also have a severe headache. At approximately 2:30am I experienced nausea and some vomiting followed by chills without fever. The headache, body aches, and extreme exhaustion continued until approximately 9pm the day after the shot. Two days later, almost all symptoms were gone (I still felt tired). I had a small red spot at the injection site that lasted 2 days but the injection site pain was way worse for the first shot than the second one.

It was pretty itchy, got really red bumps; had to put some cortisone cream on it. The rash lasted through day four (so had it day three and four). The rest of the symptoms got the worse the next day after the vaccine and slowly disappeared within about four days after vaccine. Sore throat went away at day 3. When the rash got to my fingers, I had a healthcare screen telemed through my doctor&#39;s office -  and they had me go to Urgent care where my PCP is located.  Just did visual examination and they did not tests.

I was concerned since I&#39;m pregnant that it might have to do with the pregnancy. By 2:00 pain had progressively worsened and I didn&#39;t have much of a appetite that day. Around 3:30, I started developing intense nausea - and vomited 3:45 pretty violently. I contacted the OB - and she thought I should come in to be monitored. Hospital is where I went and I got there and they monitored to see how baby was doing; did a urine test - found protein and ketones in there. Drew labs - lipase was significantly elevated - 324. 156 were where my Triglycerides were at- a bit out of range. They dx&#39;d me with Pancreatitis - idopathic since they couldn&#39;t determine cause. They admitted me to Hospital from 9th - 16th. While I was in the hospital they did further lab work. I was showing malnourished - after a clear liquids only for two days. I asked to be discharged by 16th. On the 29th, the day I took the vaccine - I had a glucose tolerance test after the vaccine (about 08:30 AM is when I started the glucose monitoring test) - they diagnosed me with gestational diabetes with that two days after vaccine on December 31st. Expected due date - April 20, 2021; low PAP A hormone; 1st pregnancy

As I left facility I started to have tingling and numbness in my right arm which is where I received injection. I then started to feel tingling and swelling in my mouth, tongue, and throat. I also noted some difficulty swallowing. I took 25 mg of Benadryl and monitored my symptoms. My symptoms resolved after 4 hours.

The pain was so intense I almost vomited and was not able to sleep. My range of motion was severely limited, and I had to use my left arm to help move my right arm.  This continued through 2/10/2021. At 1300 took 1000 mg Tylenol and had minor relief for an hour. Tried to stay hydrated and move my right arm as I could, which was still very limited. Woke up at 01:30 early morning 2/11/2021 with intense pain in right upper arm still, not able to sleep. Range of motion continues to be severely limited due to pain. Made an appointment with PCP office first thing. I was concerned I could have SIRVA and wanted to get a medical professional?s opinion. She said it is probably a combination of the Moderna vaccine and a ?bad injection,? meaning the nurse administering my vaccine at facility was very high on my deltoid (almost to my joint). I was told to call back if my arm pain or range of motion worsens.

                                                Day after Maderna Covid-19 vaccine #1 I had severe flu like symptoms.  Heavy/tight chest, bad headache all day long, chills, aches, nausea. I finally took Tylenol at 2pm and it worked wonders. I was still sick but was able to relax and sleep. Felt like mild flu after Tylenol. Next day (2 days after vaccine) felt much much better. Still have slight weakness like after being sick and some light headedness but feel like I should be back to 100% tmw.

Right upper arm, not at the injection site, had a &#34;hive&#34; about the size of a nickel that has not gone away (as of 2/23/21).   New migraines with light sensitivity that affect ability to work also have not gone away (as of 2/23/21).

I experienced headache and fatigue yesterday afternoon and developed back aches at 2030At 2330, I developed fever (100.5) with chills, nausea, diarrhea and faint feeling. I started blacking out while walking to get water and had to kneel down to the floor to prevent myself from passing out. I had tingling in my hands and feet for an hour after. I took ibuprofen at 0145, and fell asleep around 0230. As of now, I feel back to normal, other than sore arm and lingering fatigue. My fever is gone and temp back down to 98.3. I had COVID back in early December, so I expected this type of immune response with the first vaccine dose.

                                                Feb 23rd beginning around 8 PM: High fever (102), full-body rash (hives) particularly around abdomen, chest, and neck, pain/swelling around injection site, nausea and vomitting.  Feb 24th - fever and rash persisted Feb 25th - rash persisted around chest and throat, spread to under jawline, extreme fatigue, pain/swelling and redness increased at injection site, severe migraine (did not respond to max dosage of ibuprofin). Feb 26th - rash persisted just around throat/jawline, extreme fatigue persisted, pain/swelling, redness and itchiness around injection site increased, migraine persisted, large sheets of dead skin peeling off the inside of mouth (e.g., cheeks, tongue, roof of mouth) Feb 27th - rash around throat faded, pain/swelling/redness around injection site faded, increased itchiness around injection site, extreme fatigue persisted, migraine persisted, increased amounts of dead skin peeling off inside of mouth (e.g., cheeks, tongue, roof of mouth).   *The skin peeling off of the inside of my mouth (e.g., cheeks, tongue, roof of mouth) happened to me once before several years ago after a week of taking a new anti-epileptic medication (Topamax), which my neurologist prescribed to me to treat seizures following a traumatic brain injury. After a week on Topamax, the inside of my mouth began to peel uncontrollably, and so my neurologist instructed that I stop the medication immediately as I appeared to be having an allergic reaction to it. Perhaps there are similar compounds in the Moderna vaccination to Topamax, to which I may be allergic.

                                                after the shot, back pain intensified.  Throughout the day, the back pain turned into severe stomach issues.  Took stomach meds (pepto bismol) with no effect.  Went to sleep and woke up in the middle of night with stabbing pain in my stomach. used a heating pad to help me go back to sleep.  the 2nd day my stomach felt as if it was a balloon- extremely bloated and it hurt to breath deep, and stand straight. Took pepto, gas x, and also tried tums- nothing helped.  Today is day 3, and I am back to feeling normal aside from still being very tired, and hazy.  No more stomach issues.  Called doctor to see what I should do today, and was advised to not take the second dose.  Would like a second opinion.

                                                Immediately after injection, arm felt some tingling that subsided. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

Continued back to my office. Informed my supervisor that I was feeling dizzy but informed him that I had a couple bites of oatmeal, and a few cups of coffee and was going to try and eat something and hydrate and I?m sure I would feel better. I went back to work for about an hour (I work at a desk). For about an hour I continued to feel dizzy and noticed I was cloudy and was staring off. After an hour I really became dizzy and walked to my supervisors office and informed him. It felt as though I was walking on the moon to get to his office. I also felt like I had a uti. I sat down in his office and informed him of what happened. As I was talking to him I began to pass out. I did not go out the whole way but he began speaking to me more. After feeling a little better I walked back over to my office. I felt waves of dizziness and being hot and cold. My husband came and picked me up around 1:30p from work. I felt better after getting in the car and going home. Once I was home I ate and had began to feel better. Around 6:00p I began to go through another wave and was experiencing body aches, hot and cold sweats, loss of appetite, tingling all over my body but mostly in my legs and feet. At that point I went in and laid down in bed for the rest of the night. Probably around 9:00p I began to feel better. I attempted to fall asleep around 11:00p but when I closed my eyes I felt like they were racing back and forth. So I got back up and watched something in tv until I fell asleep maybe about 30 minutes later. I woke up the next morning around 8:45a. I tossed and turned most of the night, however I felt better. It was like I had the flu for a few days and on the last day I felt better but was under the weather. At this point in the morning I was fatigued. I was able to perform some tasks around the house.  I then laid back down in bed for a few hours because I was beginning to feel dizzy and was experiencing hot and cold sweats. After a few hours I got up from bed and performed a few more tasks around the house. Then was able to sit down on the couch and watch some tv. At this point I?m still expediting tingling in my body at times. Still a little dizzy but able to focus and hot and cold sweats.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

Slight shoulder pain right of the day, with a headache starting after 30 min. Later that night around 10-11pm i woke up with a splitting headache, chills, cold sweat and had a fever of 100.7. Took tylenol, woke up feeling better.  Mild headache lasted 3 days, when headache stopped heaviness/pain started in my left armpit - huge swollen lymph node (injection side). Was painful for 1.5 wks, this past week the lymph node is still swollen but not painful. I tried to go for a run 3 days after injection, I was short of breath and legs felt heavy (usually walk 2 miles daily with dogs, run 3-4 miles 3-4x/wk) figured that went along with swollen lymph node. Today is the first day I was able to run without difficulty catching my breath and my legs don&#39;t feel as heavy (2 miles, slow jog vs run).

Then rapid heart rate and chest tightness by 2.5hrs post vaccine. I went to urgent Care and they thought it was an allergic reaction (BP 182/90, HR 82) and gave me 125mg solumedrol and Benadryl intramuscularly which caused worsened dizziness and a racing heart which caused me to collapse and they gave me a epi pen and called 911. I was transferred to ER and they completed EKG which was normal and monitored vitals for a few hours and I was released. I continue to remain extremely dizzy and nauseated 2days after the vaccine.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine my tongue started to swell and almost felt hairy. My chest became tight, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I was light headed and dizzy. The next two days after I was extremely lethargic. I could bravely stay awake for more that 20 minutes at a time for the first two days. I was also extremely hungry but still had the metallic taste in my mouth. Until day 3 I would still feel like my tongue felt hairy when the benedryl would wear off.On day 3 I became nauseous and broke out in hives on my hands and neck. I did not fully feel like I had my energy back and was like ?myself? until 4 days after receiving the vaccine

                                                Patient had an appointment for her first Covid vaccination today at 10:30am. Pt came in feeling fine but anxious about getting her vaccination. Pt also mentioned to both intern and I that she is a hypochondriac. She got her IM vaccination and sat down for 15 minutes as we monitored her. After her 15 minutes of sitting down in pharmacy area and being monitored by our intern and pharmacist, they asked how she&#39;s doing. Pt expressed she felt fine but had a dry mouth, and the intern told her to call 911 immediately if any shortness of breath occurred, but patient felt fine and left. About 25 minutes later she returned and expressed that she had a metallic taste in her mouth and was anxious about the shot. We asked her to sit down so we can monitor her further and she did. Five minutes later she expressed tongue swollen a little and a little difficulty swallowing but had no trouble breathing. At that time pharmacy intern and I (pharmacist) decided to give the epipen injection and patient agreed. We had the patient sit down for another 30 minutes as we monitored her. Minutes later, pt started to feel better as we continuously monitored her. During this time patient requested water due to dry mouth. We handed her a bottle of water but asked her to please sip and not take big gulps. After 30 minutes patient felt better. No swollen tongue, no difficulty swallowing or breathing and anxiety had been relieved. Patient was notified by pharmacy to call MD to let him know of reaction and was also told to call 911 immediately if have any further reaction. PT felt comfortable to leave at this point.

                                                Diarrhea. I had diarrhea in the form of soft stools that started one week after dose 1 of Covid-19  Vaccine. Then I found out I had Giardia Infection. I got the second dose and the diarrhea got much worse. I just started to take the antibiotic for treatment of the Giardia.

                                                Was fine immediately post vaccine. Drove home and proceeded with a normal rest of the day at home. Went to sleep around 10 pm. Woke up at 4 am with my arm very sore. Got up to take meds for my arm pain and once I got to the bathroom felt pale, sweaty, nauseous and had chills, very weak - an overwhelming sense of not feeling right and strong fatigue. I sat on the toilet and went to the bathroom (urination and defecation) but did not have the energy to wipe properly. I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn&#39;t wiped properlyat the time, that&#39;s how out of it I was. I have never fainted or passed out ever before in my 31 years of life. I live alone and it was a very scary incident for me. Luckily my injuries were minor and I have recovered but I felt like I might die during the episode. My body had a very strong adverse reaction 12 hours post vaccine.

I began to feel nauseous around 6-6:30 on the night of 1/21/21 (vaccine administered on 1/20/21). I then began vomiting until approximately 8:00 pm. The nausea persisted until some point in the night, but I fell asleep so I?m unsure when. Stomach pain persisted the same as the nausea.. woke up next morning feeling much better, but dehydrated. Still unsure if stomach pain is related, but positive the nausea and vomiting was from vaccine.

                                                At 6 hours from vaccination (day 0), very strong shoulder pain. Needed tylenol, have never needed tylenol after a shot in my life before.  Shoulder pain continued through to the day after vaccination (day 1) - had to take tylenol around the clock. By day 2 it was normal. On Day 0, around 8-10 hours post vaccination, I had rigors which lasted a few mins, chills, fevers, myalgias. Took tylenol. On day 1, about 17 hours from vaccination, I woke up with lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea. Felt like I was going to pass out. Laid down, and it passed. Continued with myalgias, fevers, chills, fatigue on day 1. By day 2, I felt normal. I took tylenol day 0 and day 1.

Chills, shaking, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.  At about 24 hours I developed a terrible migraine.  My fevers persisted despite taking ibuprofen.  At about 48 hours I was finally able to keep fevers down and am now feeling better.  The dizziness was so bad my husband had to walk me to the bathroom to throw up.  The fever and chills were so bad I couldn&#39;t rest for longer than 5-15 minute increments.

I was unable to control my fever/pain with IBU or APAP. These symptoms lasted approximately 36 hours. At about that time, I began experiencing GI upset, where I was throwing up and had no appetite for 48 additional hours.

The following day 02/03/21  at approximately 1:00 pm pt. developed a red rash on her face and chest.  She had no other symptoms at that time.  The rash was not itchy or painful- she was just red.  It was recommended that she contact her primary care physician.  At approximately 3:38 pm she contacted me to let me know that she had taken Benadryl as recommended by her primary care physician.  She reports that about an hour later the red rash was gone.  She denies any other symptoms.

I slowly laid down with feet above heart until it subsided and slowly went back to bed. My galaxy watch says pulse dropped to 40. Normally 60&#39;s. Later in the morning at 7am chills started and migraine with light aura (kind of like the pixels on an old tv). Took asa, tylenol, and drank water to help. Feeling hazy all day.

I took 100mg of acetaminophen and felt some relief, but after 3hrs the symptoms came back. I continued to take 1000mg of acetaminophen and  800mg ibuprofen alternately every 4hrs with a little relief but the chills and body aches continued for 24hrs with intermittent nausea and diarrhea.  The second day I woke up with a migraine that lasted around 24hrs with no relief from symptoms even when taking  OTC migraine relief medications. On the third day post vaccine I woke up feeling  completely fine and have not had any lingering symptoms.

                                                Around 4 PM I started getting chills. I took Ibuprofen and it was much easier. It started coming back around 7:00 pm. I had super sensitive skin and chills that night and didn&#39;t sleep very much, if at all. I didn&#39;t go to work that day because I still had a fever in the morning. It broke mid-morning but I was nauseous all day and had a headache. I still had a headache the following day and I didn&#39;t want to eat the next day although I wasn&#39;t nauseous. Also on that third day- the redness and swelling started in my arm where the injection site was on the right arm. It was swollen, hot to touch. I called the Dr. again. I got a different doctor than the first dose. She thought it was an allergic reaction. She said to try antihistamines that day but if it didn&#39;t get better she did prescribe a different kind of antibiotic I took the antihistamines that day and it didn&#39;t get any better. So than I took the antibiotic and it got better. It was better by Friday evening.

Woke up that evening with a 100.4 degree fever, and freezing with chills.   Next day was unable to function due to fatigue, fever, chills, and rash.  I could barely move my arm, and any slight touch caused pain to shoot through my arm.   All symptoms lasted until Sunday, February 28th until mid morning.   As of 3/1/2021, I no longer have a fever, or headache, still feeling fatigued, and my stomach is upset, as well as the rash on my arm has not gone away, the rash is warm to the touch, and still raised, but less red and painful as it was yesterday

                                                Day 1-3 had painful and sore arm near injection site. (It felt like the vaccine settled in my arm about an inch below the injection site. It seemed slightly inflamed and was sore to the touch).  Bruise developed at injection site (possibly due to needle bursting blood vessel) which is still present 7 days after vaccination was administered.  One week after vaccination a rash developed on my left arm in the same area that was painful immediately after the injection of the Moderna vaccine. Rash is red, firm, slightly inflamed/raised, warm to the touch, and itches.  I have been treating with topical ointments (benadryl cream, cortisone cream) and ice packs applied to the area.  Other symptoms that manifested the same day the rash began: gas, lose stool, fatigue, body aches, swollen lymph nodes in throat.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

                                                Severe migraines starting around 36 hours after first vaccination. Arm was sore after 2-3 hours of shot. Missed work 1/2 day on Thursday 1/7/2021 because I woke up at 6am with worst headache I?ve had, took Tylenol &amp; it eased off, went into work at my health Dept I work at. Thursday night 1/7, I had headaches so bad I couldn?t sit up, putting ice packs on my head made it worse, ears ringing, started throwing up with severe stomach pains at 11pm on 1/7/2021. Took excederin &amp; Dramamine around 11am Friday 1/8/21, been alternating Tylenol &amp; excederin with some improvement in headache. Slept most all of today 1/8/21 with my highest fever getting up to 100  degrees Fahrenheit on Friday 1/8/21 at 11am. Currently it?s at 98. Bad body aches &amp; feeling uneasy/shaky the night of 1/7/21

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Returns to clinic at 0739. Had first dose of Moderna vaccine at 0715 today.  She states that immediately after her lips felt tingly.  She states that she was driving home and she began to feel tingling and numbness into her face around her mouth.  Patient denies having any allergies. Was walking her to the ED and she was talking to nurse, all of a sudden she leaned forward and was coughing and grabbing her throat. Rapid response team called, patient transferred to ED. She gets influenza thoughts without difficulty.  She denies any current URI symptoms no history of heart or lung problems high blood pressure or diabetes.  She denies numbness or tingling in her hands currently.  Currently very nauseated. Patient was given some BENADRYL and some Zofran was watched she still complained of some perioral numbness some labs were obtained potassium is minimally low at 3.5 calcium is also low at 8.1.  This time I suspect this is more of an adverse reaction to immunization shot however if the tingling or numbness persists then a recheck of her electrolytes may be warranted follow-up primary care physician.

Symptoms began on Wednesday 12/30/2020 and lasted until Saturday 01/02/2021 after I called my primary care physician who prescribed Imodium and Zofran to help with the Diarrhea and Nausea/Vomiting. Symptoms lessened and around Monday  010/04/2021 I was able to keep fluids down and felt better overall.

                                                I was vaccinated on 01/07/2021.  I did have some significant side effects including fever, headache, extremely painful left arm at injection site, hives that the injection site that lasted approximately 4 hours and were resolved with Benadryl and ibuprofen., nausea and significant fatigue.  The pain in the arm after injection was not at the injection site but several inches below the injection site.  On 01/13/21 I developed a raised, red, painful rash below the injection site on the left arm but at the site where the severe pain was.  This is also being investigated by Infectious Disease.

Took on empty stomach and felt nauseated and went and vomited. No other reactions other than fatigue and low appetite and sore arm the rest of the day. Ate less that day and so did get nausea off and on during the day - but not as severe and no more vomiting. 25th - everything resolved.  6/16/21 - estimated date of delivery. 1st pregnancy. Has been a normal pregnancy.

At 5:15 AM the following morning (1/14/21) I experienced lightheadedness and fainted off the toilet hitting my face on the wall/radiator in front of me.  My husband (who witnessed the fainting episode) stated I began convulsing and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head for 5-10 seconds. Upon regaining consciousness I was covered in sweat. After being assisted back to bed, I had nausea and headache with continued severe pain at injection site. I went to the ER around 6:45 AM since my severe headache, dizziness and nausea continued and to examine if I broke my nose in the fall. While in triage at the ER I experienced severe nausea and a second episode of fainting.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

Diphenhydramine, famotidine, methylprednisolone, and a LR bolus was administered.  Following IM epinephrine administration, the patient&#39;s hemodynamic instability promptly improved along with her mentation.  Patient was monitored for 4.5 hours before being discharged home under the care of her partner with a EpiPen autoinjector kit.

                                                Patient had her first Moderna COVID vaccination at 4:00 PM today and 5 min later felt dizziness, worsening, associated with headache, nausea, sore throat, hot flashes, and dizziness is from side to side when she looks at her phone, no dizziness when she does not look at it. Patient primary complaint is headache on bilateral temples. All other symptoms resolved, and no dizziness if not looking at phone.  Patient has history of headaches, similar in quality, but this is more intense (6/10 intensity, less than her scoliosis pains, but more than usual headache pain), but otherwise the same, pounding sensation, and she can feel throbbing. Headache is about the same currently. Started simultaneously as dizziness, immediately, unchanged. No changes in vision. Peak intensity of headache around 30 min after onset, peak at 4:30 or so.  Patient notified the vaccine clinic staff and was instructed to be observed in another area, and did not improve. Patient remembered that her initial blood pressure was low and it fluctuated. Patient was then sent to the ED.  Upon initial assessment in the Emergency Department 2 hours after her initial injection, the assessment is likely vasovagal near syncope with tension headache, rather than true allergic reaction. Given metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, normal saline, and obtained labs.

                                                First I felt a soreness in my right arm, which spread to my neck and down my arm in the next few hours after the vaccine. Later that evening (around 7pm) I became sore and achy in my muscles and joints all over my body. I also alternated between feeling feverish and having chills.  My temperature was 99.8F. The next day I awoke with all the same symptoms and also a severe headache. My temperature that morning was 100.9F. I felt so tired and fatigued that I couldn&#39;t move my body or stay awake for too long. I stayed in bed all day and didn&#39;t have much of an appetite. I took NSAIDS and Acetaminophen to reduce the headache pain and control the fever. The following day (today) I woke up with fewer symptoms. I still had a severe headache, was overly tired,  and had a mild fever (99.8F). I remained in bed most of the day (napping), and have had a slightly improved appetite. I took Aleve this morning for the headache, but haven&#39;t needed it since (at 8:30pm). It seems that the side effects are subsiding. My right arm is still tender surrounding the injection site and I still have a faint headache, but it is now tolerable.

I had extreme fatigue to where I couldn&#39;t get off of the floor because I was so weak. My heart rate was super high. I felt overall really miserable for a long time and I was seen that morning. I slept like 18 hours the next day. The following day, 30th, missed work. I was tired. No more vomiting, fever and no more diarrhea, but still had body aches and chills and still very tired. Everything slowly started getting better and I was able to work on the 31st. I developed a headache and body aches for a while. My arm was also sore.

Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine I was having fever, chills, body aches, nausea, and vomiting, and diarrhea and dizziness and weakness and heart palpitations(probably related to dehydration). Symptoms remained for 3 days. Unable to hold down anything. Felt like I had covid all over again just without the respiratory issues and loss of taste and smell. Arm was very sore almost like a deep bone bruise. Brain fog developed again like after initially recovering from covid as did the fatigue. Still having lingering fatigue and now carpal tunnel like symptoms in both hands, slight weakness and numbness at times in right upper arm where vaccine was given. Reported event to Pharmacist to administered the vaccine and the CDC.

                                                Red raised bump started a couple minutes after injection. Area was red and hotter the next day and sore. Red area turned into a bruise after 4-5 days and then went away for about a day. Then it came back and I still have it. Now I have a bad headache and nausea.

                                                1/26 evening I developed body aches, lower back pain, nausea, brain fog, fatigue.  On Friday I started my period a week early and it was unusually heavy (this hasn?t happened much since I was a teenager) on Saturday I was bleeding so heavily and had lightheadedness, near syncope, headache, nausea, weakness, fatigue and brain fog. Usually menstrual cycle is not as heavy and doesn?t come early and I don?t experience these types of symptoms (usually just bad cramps and back pain with less heavy bleeding).

Affected my daily activities and could not go to work.  I am a pharmacist, and this did really impact my job as my boss had to get other pharmacists from other cities to cover my shifts.   My work has a protocol related to covid, they will not let me back for a week.

Nausea and vomiting - nausea was on and off starting about 10 hours post vaccine. My body attempted to throw up twice but there was nothing in my body to bring up. The nausea and vomiting could have been from the intensity of the headache but I am unsure.  About 10.5 hours post vaccine I took 1000 mg Tylenol and then an hour after taking Tylenol, I tool 220 mg naproxen sodium. I was unable to fall asleep because the headache was so bad.   I woke up about 5 hours later and knew my fever had broken and the headache was mild. The headache continued on and off (most noticeable in the morning and at night) for about a week post vaccine.

Then around 9/10pm I had chills and low grade fever of 99 degrees F. I took tylenol and went to bed with extra blankets and a heating pad since my body could not get warm. I also felt very nauseous. I woke up around 12am with a fever of 101 and sweating. Took some ibprofen and fell back asleep. My fever broke in the night but when I woke up I felt achy and had a headache. I took ibprofen and my temperature was normal however about an hour or two later I started to get another low grade fever and too tyelnol again.  The fever went away and never came back but I had a slight headache for several hours and was very fatigued all day. The next day I woke up feeling fine.

However, light bleeding/spotting started that night/next day but thought still normal.  Heavier bleeding started 2/6/21 (Saturday) and continued through the weekend. Made appointment at hospital lab for Monday 2/8 to check HcG levels in blood.  See below for details, but Dr. suggested repeat blood work on 2/10 as Hcg levels showed positive pregnancy, but very low.  2/10 Hcg levels slightly lower, which confirmed early miscarriage occurring.

Patient was given cold water to drink and I put a fan on her to help cool her off. Once her mouth became tingly, we agreed to call EMS to come check her out. Once EMS arrived, patient was feeling better. EMS checked her vitals and released her. We called her Aunt to come pick her up.

                                                Arm soreness and fatigue the first evening post-vaccine. Around approximately 2300, I had chills, hot flashes, and a low fever (101) along with tachycardia, which lasted several hours. My heart rate was up to 150bpm at its highest while at rest. I took 800mg ibuprofen which seemed to help.  The next day I was very fatigued and nauseated. I started to have some gum soreness as well. The next day (2/21) I felt much better, but my lips felt very chapped along with some gum pain. As the days went on, the inside of my lips against my gums and teeth felt very raw and painful, and my lips became extremely chapped, while the corners of my mouth were cracked and painful as well.  On or around 2/24, I began to have some very sore spots on my soft palate, inner lips, and inside of my cheeks. They mostly became small white sores, except for my lips, which became very red with tiny blood spots just under the skin.  As of today (2/27), I still have sore gums, small sores on the inside of my mouth, several under my tongue, and the red sore spots on the inside of my lips.  It isn&#39;t life-threatening, but it is very uncomfortable, and makes eating and drinking painful. I don&#39;t feel the need to go to an ED or urgent care at this time, but will try to make an appointment with a GP as soon as I can.

                                                Received the vaccine intramuscularly in right arm at 1:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and muscle soreness began approx. 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Fatigue and headache present by 3:00 PM on 3/3/21. Began hydrating with water and Gatorade at this time. Muscle pain and join soreness present from right shoulder to right hand by 4:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and stiffness in fingers of right hand by 5:00 PM on 3/3/21. Mild congestion, brain fog by 6:00 PM on 3/3/21. Any contact between right arm and other objects or surfaces caused significant pain by 8:00 PM on 3/3/21. Took 800 mg ibuprofin to alleviate pain (pre-existing tolerance to NSAIDs necessitates higher than normal dosages). Swelling of the right arm and hand identified by 9:00 PM on 3/3/21. Swelling was most significant in the hand, and accompanied worsening joint pain and stiffness in the fingers. Applied a cold pack to address swelling (20 minutes on, 20 minutes off). Could not identify these specific side effects in the information available online, took a Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Swelling decreased overnight and was gone by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21. Diarrhea began at 6:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Will continue to hydrate with water and Gatorade. At the time of this report, pain in right arm still present from shoulder to wrist and entire arm is tender to the touch, but pain level has lessened. Pain and stiffness in right side of neck present by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Lymph nodes in right underarm swollen by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and swelling is still present at the time of this report. Will continue with regimen of ibuprofin as needed.  * I am recovering fine at home, but I wanted to log these side effects for data collection purposes. I couldn&#39;t find any information about these side effects online and that really freaked me out, so I hope that writing this report will help people in a similar situation.

                                                I am writing to you in regards my Moderna adverse reaction. I got your information from a small Facebook group that?s going through the same issues as me. On 1/31/21, I received my first shot of Moderna. I was told to stay 30min because I have a Sulfa allergy. I also received a flu shot 3 weeks prior. After 15 min I started to feel tingling in my face and throat tightness. As time passed, I started to feel like I couldn?t breathe at one point. As I continued to have issues breathing and started getting nauseous and lightheaded, they informed a nurse to look over me. The nurse had a student nurse do my vitals manually. She gives out standard numbers 60 heart rate and 120/80 blood pressure. My normal blood pressure is elevated in 130-140/80-90. I had to be picked up due to feeling unwell. I went home took Tylenol and slept.  The next few weeks I kept feeling zaps of sharp pain in my chest area. On the 12th day after the vaccine, I had a panic attack. The panic attack started with a sharp pain in my neck and when I inhaled it hurt. I got heart palpitations and again felt like I couldn?t breathe. I never suffered from a panic attack, so we called 911. The EMTs came my blood pressure was 200s/100s and elevated heart rate (sorry don?t remember exact numbers). It was suggested I go to the ER since my numbers were high. In the ER I told the doctor about my vaccine incident. They got blood work done and she decided to do a CT scan and X-ray since something was elevated ( I don?t remember what was elevated. I am working on getting that info). My EKG, CT scan and X-ray all came out fine. I was then diagnosed with panic disorder. I was sent home and after a few hours I started to feel an internal tremor.  I describe the tremor as having a cell phone on vibrate its usually is in my lower abdomen to pelvic area. My blood pressure kept spiking up into 180-190/80-100. I kept reaching out for help by going to ER once more, 3 urgent care visits and my primary. No one could help me, and I kept getting labeled as having panic/anxiety disordered. My primary doctor said I could be having adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I just have to wait it out. The internal tremor I feel constantly and sometimes it?s in my chest. I have muscle twitching, tingling in my lower limbs, muscle pain, and blood pressure spikes. I do feel like my symptoms cause anxiety because ill have these spells where I feel adrenaline running through me which will cause anxiousness. My blood pressure is getting better, but I still have spikes and have had another panic attack.  I have been on Lexapro 5mg and gabapentin 300mg 3x a day for 5 weeks. During that time, my symptoms have not improved. I will be getting off the medication soon. I never had any of these issues prior. I don?t drink, smoke or do any drugs besides the medication prescribed.   On 3/30/21, I reached out to my psychiatrist again and went into more detail about everything and she said she believes me about the vaccine side effects.  She recommended I go back to my primary care doctor and ask to be referred to UCSD covid long haulers study to see if they can help me. I wanted to share my information to see if it might be help to your research.  Thank you for your time

                                                I have a history of prior anaphylaxis in 2009 when I received (separate arms, same date and time) the 2009 seasonal flu vaccine and the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. Both were from multi-dose vials and providers I established care with following the reaction believed I likely had a reaction to a preservative. I?ve received single-dose flu vaccines with no issues since then. When I received the Moderna covid vaccine on 1/8/21 I had some right-sided throat swelling about 15 minutes after injection. It did not worsen and I was monitored for 1 hour after shot time. I went home and the feeling in my throat resolved after about 4-5 hours with no medication or intervention needed. I did not have any other symptoms until 3pm on 1/9/21. Started with mild abdominal pain, an hour and a half later I had chills, headache, fatigue and fever around 100.8F. No medication taken. The fever resolved within about 6-7 hours. On Sunday 1/10/21 the abdominal pain worsened and was a constant pain around umbilical region that felt as if it radiated outward, LLQ slightly worse. It was severe, directly affected normal daily functions. I could not walk, move, eat or drink room-temp water without pain increasing.  Walking 20ft at one point even caused me to crumble to the floor and cry, had to stay there for 5 minutes before even attempting to get back to the couch. No diarrhea, no vomiting, no fever, no nausea. I did have loss of appetite. The pain continued through the night and was constant. I could not find a comfortable position to lay in and tossed and turned most of the night. At 0430 on 1/11/21 I got up out of bed to pee, abdominal pain was so bad it kept me awake for about an hour after. Pain finally started to improve and I was able to sleep from 0530-0930. When I woke up on 1/11/21 around 0930 my abdominal pain was very mild and continued to improve as the day went on. Currently (1600 on 1/11/21) my abdomen feels about 90% better, I have no other symptoms. The symptoms, specifically the fever and abdominal pain, caused me to miss 2 days of work (Sunday 1/10/21 and Monday 1/11/21).

Jan 4- Jan 7  Rash decreased with time and was just a big red mark (roughly bigger fist) that also carried some physical heat-not like the rest of my arm.  No sign of rash or redness by Jan 8  Through Dec 27-first week of Jan I seem to have felt nauseated but comes and goes in waves.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

It lasted 3 days and I took the Zofran and felt fine.

                                                December 29-31, 2020 Terrible headache, body aches, fatigue, diarrhea, sore right arm.  Jan 1-2, 2021 Headache, loose stool Jan 3, 2021 I woke up with a red, warm, itchy, rash at vaccine injection site on right arm. The rest was the size of a baseball. The rash was painful to the touch. Jan 4, 2021 The rash turned hard like cellulitis and was not as red. Still warm to the touch and itchy.  Jan 5-7, 2021 The right arm rash seemed to be improving, it was not as red and the hardness went away. There were little red dots in a ring where the circle of the rash had been.  Jan 8-10, 2021 I developed an itch over my entire body, it would not stop itching. My right arm starts to get the red itchy rash back when I workout or walk my dog, any time I get my heart rate up. I have to take Benadryl to help the itching go down.   Jan 11-12, 2021 My body is still itchy all over. When I exercise, my right arm gets red and itchy. My neck, throat, face, lips, and ears start to develop red hive-like blotches and they are itchy 20 minutes into my workout. This improves when I am done with my workout.  Jan 13-14, 2021 My face had a red rash over the nose and cheeks. This rash is sensitive to the touch. Jan 15 - Today Jan 16, 2021 The itch is very faint now. The red rash on my face is improving. Otherwise I feel normal.

                                                A rash appeared on the upper left leg about 5-10 minutes after the vaccine was administered. A slight burning/stinging sensation was experienced during the 15 minute observation period after vaccine administration; however, at the time, this was attributed to warmth from sitting in the sun. After return to work, the rash was noticed during a bathroom break, which spanned the entirety of the front of the upper left leg. A significant amount of nausea was also experienced about an hour after vaccine administration; however, it stopped short of vomiting. The rash lessened throughout the day and was nearly gone by the end of the night. The nausea also subsided around 6 pm. Only mild flu-like symptoms were experienced the following day (headache, fatigue, head congestion), which were ameliorated 48 hrs post vaccine administration. Pain in the left arm was also experienced, which peaked 24 hours after vaccine administration and subsided 48 hours after.

When I went to turn on my right side I heard a popping noise in my neck and was no longer able to move my neck to my right. I got up scared and started to experience chills, nausea, and dizziness. I went back to bed to try to calm down. I was not able to move my neck at this point or pick up my head off the bed. I called my sist

My arm was also very sore, but there was not swelling or redness at the site of injection. The side effects abated the next day, and I felt completely normal by Monday the 18th.

                                                At about 7:30 pm, I started getting cold chills. I was under 3 heavy blankets with warm clothing and heat packs still shivering.  By 9 pm, body aches had started.  I took a 500 mg tylenol.  The cold chills went away with the tylenol but did nothing for the body aches. At 11:30 pm, I took 200 mg of ibuprofen because my entire body hurt and I was unable to fall asleep or really move much due to the discomfort. The ibuprofen helped reduce the intensity of the body aches but I got very little sleep.  At 6:30 am, the body aches were intense again  and I started getting hot flashes and nausea. My husband called in sick to help care for our 3 young kids.  I took another 200 mg of  ibuprofen  and that reduced the symptoms again. I can now get around the house instead of laying in bed but would not be able to work.  I did not ever have a measurable fever.  I do have a pretty sore arm

I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

At this time I took two Tylenol &amp; two Advil with a Ketorolac. The restless leg continued into full body aches, head to toe. Headache to migraine (this varied from on the top of my head to my left temple). These symptoms were consistent throughout the day, with severe fatigue. 1000 of 1/20/21 I was feeling chills and again nausea (again dry heaves). I drank ginger ale for the nausea, but I had no appetite till 1400. 1100 I took four more Tylenol. The aches subsided towards evening, however the headache in my left temple remained for the rest of the night. At 0500 on 1/21/21 I took more Tylenol and woke up later without the headache and body aches. However fatigue did linger with some back pain throughout the day. On the morning of 1/21/21 I did notice a lump and redness at injection site, as well as being painful to the touch.

My fever reduced to 99 degrees around 0730am and remained as such through the following day (1/28/21) as the chills, nausea, and cold sweats gradually faded away. I was deeply fatigued and unable to work.  Sometime mid afternoon I developed a crippling frontal headache That worsened in the light and standing. I have no history of headaches or migraines. I was still repulsed by the thought of eating. I took acetaminophen with a protein shake and it helped the headache And residual body aches enough for me to sleep. 1/29/21 I awoke still fatigued  with a minor headache.   I am a pro athlete with no underlying conditions. I have had my flu shot yearly with no side effects. I am extremely fit and eat a healthy balanced diet, maintain a healthy athletic weight, sleep 7-8 hours a night, do not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use recreational drugs. I was absolutely floored at how sick this shot made me.

Those symptoms continued well into the early hours of the next morning, while dry heaving/vomiting 2x within that 12 hour period.  I continued to feel nauseas and have a headache well into the next day.  The majority of symptoms lasted 24 hours.  I drank water and diligently took Tylenol through that 24 hour period.

                                                At 1:17 PM, I received the vaccine. Around 1:30 PM I started itching and breaking out in hives. I did not say anything because I thought it was my eczema reacting to my nerves. I went home and felt fine for a while. Around 5:30 PM I told my husband my stomach hurt and I had a slight headache, and I was going to lie down. Around 8:30 PM I woke up. Around 11 PM I was feeling kind of light-headed but did not say anything to my husband because I just thought it was my thoughts. I went to bed. Around 3:45 AM I woke up feeling sick, went to bathroom in master bedroom and dry heaved. I returned to the bed from our bathroom, and told my husband I thought I was going to pass out. I have no recollection of the following events, this is information my husband (Brian) shared with me. He said I then stayed standing on the floor, laid my head over on my pillow, and started breathing heavily, and it became progressively heavier to where he stated I sounded like a &#34;wart hog.&#34; He said he jokingly said to me, &#34;Are you mutating,&#34; then I collapsed onto our bedroom floor. He said he got up immediately, was saying my name as he was walking to me, and I was not responding. He then got on the floor by me, and was rubbing me and trying to wake me, and it took about a minute before I came to. When I came to I was laying on our floor, keep in mind I feel approximately 5 feet as our bed sits 4 to 4.5 feet in the air, and I am 5&#39;8&#34;. I hit my hit on our floor, and when I came to I could barely hear him calling my name as there was a loud rushing noise like water in my head. It took about 2-3 minutes before the ringing was completely gone. I then had cold chills off and on for the next 24 hours with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. On Tuesday following the initial encounter, I went to the ER due to nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and severe headache on right side of head. The ER doctor diagnosed me after a CT with a closed head injury that occurred at initial encounter, so Thursday around 4 AM.

                                                I initially had a sore arm which was anticipated but a few days later I noticed pain from a swollen lymph node(s) in the same armpit (about 3-4 days later) which lasted several days. Over the next few days I experienced diarrhea, weakness, fatigue, extreme neck pain (on the same side as the injection), swelling and redness of my arm at the injection site (9 days after), a few hives on my face. It is currently 2 weeks after I&#39;ve received the vaccine and I feel extreme muscle aches, slight headache, and pain in my upper abdomen and back. I was in very good shape prior to receiving this vaccine but now when I go to the gym I cannot lift as much as I could before, nor do I have energy like I did prior to the vaccine.

I had severe headaches and vertigo by the next morning, nausea, and debilitating joint pain. By day 3, I continued experiencing headaches and spontaneous vertigo. I have been extremely tired and can sleep for hours.  Day 4, I was feeling much better. I went out that night, and after only 2 drinks, the vertigo came back so badly, I wasn&#39;t able to drive home. For the following days till today, I am still experiencing terrible headaches that will not even lessen with medication, spontaneous vertigo although they don&#39;t last too long any more, and I am extremely tired all the time.

                                                I was vaccinated on the 14th of January. Initially I just had a sore arm and fatigue on the 15th. The night of the 17th I was working out and had a vasovagal type episode (never had this before). By the morning of the 18th I was fatigued and had a cough that can be described as a bronchial spasm type cough, I assumed that it had to do with the work out and the episode the night before. I woke up on the 19th very sick. Fever, chills, fatigue, nausea. Because I am a healthcare provider I was able to go strait to the hospital and get an expedited COVID Test. By that afternoon I had my test back with positive results. Over the next few days the symptoms progressed. I had extreme headache, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath if I moved around at all, cough, loss of taste and smell, nausea, abdominal px, diarrhea, lac of apatite, extrema &#34;brain fog&#34;. These symptoms continued for about a week. Most of the symptoms subsided after that time except for the fatigue off and on and a continuous cough that as of 2/11/2021 has still not gone away.

                                                Almost immediately my arm was sore (as expected). However, about 7 hours after the shot I developed a fever (101), body aches, weakness, reduced O2 saturation (95-95), tightness in my chest,  fatigue, nausea, and headache. These symptoms were severe and persistent from 8pm 2/19 through overnight on 2/21. I treated it with Extra Strength Tylenol 1,000mg every 6 hours like clockwork, hydration and rest. I slept about 18-20 hours each day (Saturday and Sunday).   I awoke on 2/22 with only fatigue, sporadic tightness in my chest and O2 at 95 remaining. As of today 2/22 at 2:40pm the tightness in my chest has gone and my fatigue is gone. I do not know my O2 saturation right now as I left my reader at home.

                                                I developed a moderately severe headache, body aches, fatigue and nausea within a few hours of the vaccine. These symptoms persisted into the next day, but had decreased in severity after about 24 hours. I still had a mild headache and body aches (specifically back, neck, and R shoulder pain) the next two days. Three days after, I started feeling worse. The headache again became moderately severe, as well as the neck and back pain,  fatigue and nausea.  This has continued through today (day 8 post-vaccine).  I still have a moderately severe constant headache (dull with throbbing with exertion or movement in neck), back and neck pain and stiffness, mild nausea, and fatigue.

                                                On Sunday, January 3rd, I woke up to find a rash about 3 inches long, starting at the vaccination site. By Tuesday it had widened. I have photos of both Sunday and Tuesday?s rash, if you would like me to forward those to you. Wednesday night the rash had lightened in color, it was mostly just the outline, but had grown larger than my hand. It crept up towards my shoulder, underarm, and about half way down to my elbow.   Thursday morning (yesterday) I called medical provider to make a Virtual Visit at 5:30pm same day. APRN, called me at about 12:20pm and told me to go to the ER right away. My throat felt swollen and constricted at the time, though I was able to breathe, drink and eat. Swallowing was a bit difficult.  I was seen by PA, at the ER at MC. She evaluated me and said the reaction was bad, but not severe, and on the mend. She prescribed oral prednisone 20mg for the next five days. I did not need any steroid or Benadryl shots. She also said she feels comfortable with me getting the second COVID-19 vaccination, which is scheduled for 1/25.

                                                on Wed 1/6/21 I had an allergic reaction and am unsure what set it off.  My eyes became itchy, watery and my corneas swelled.  I was sneezing and coughing.  I had a runny nose. on Sun 1/10/21 I had an allergic reaction; I think it was set off by a type of sunblock I&#39;ve never used before.  But I&#39;ve never had a reaction to any type of sunblock before. I went into anaphylactic shock: eyes swollen shut, flushed face, tight throat, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, severe abdominal cramping.  I had to go to the ER.

                                                I received my vaccination at approximately 7pm on Friday January 15th. Upon receiving my vaccinations I felt light headed, but after fifteen minutes I was okay to stand up and leave the facility. At around 12:05am  I began coughing and body aches and it continued throughout the night. By morning my cough had subsided, and I felt okay. By 11:30 am on 16th my body and skin began to tingle all over and I felt a burning sensation under my skin. My head began pound and a feeling of nausea came over me. I started feeling very warm about 10 minutes later and decided to take off my sweater and found that I had a large red rash across my chest. My temperature began to rise and my tongue and face began to swell and a feeling of shortness of breath came over me. By 4:00 my fever hit 104.2 and my body began to stiffen up  and my jaw began to clench involuntarily In small bursts for a total of what my family believes to have been 5-10 minutes. After taking 1000 mg of Tylenol my fever dropped to 103 for the next two hours and I began to shake uncontrollably, then it began to spike a again reaching 103.6. My spouse put cold towels on me and opened the windows to our bedroom to cool me down. Slowly my temperature started dropping and it finally reached 101 by 11pm. The next morning, Sunday, I woke with blisters on my mouth and severe body aches.

I was nauseated, weak, tired, and had muscles aches and a horrible headache. I had taken ibuprofen at 4a with no relief. At 7a I took Tylenol and did get some relief from all but the headache until the Tylenol wore off about 12p. At 1p I took more Tylenol and this time the relief wasn?t as much. I wound up bed with chills, fatigue, body aches, nausea, and headache for the next 8 hours. I took more Tylenol (1000mg), ibuprofen (400mg), and a Benadryl (25mg) at 9p in hopes of getting some sleep. At 10p I woke up overly hot from the 3 blankets on me. My temp was 101.5 at that time. I was able to go back to sleep and woke up with only some weakness and muscle aches in the morning.

I understand that these were expected with the second dose. However at 9:40am I began vomiting. By 11am my throat started to close so I went to the ER. I had a minor asthma attack while I was there (coughing fit and slight wheezing). I was evaluated and they gave me IV fluids as well as other medications through the IV. I received solu-medrol, Benadryl, antacid, and anti-nausea. They took blood tests, urinalysis, and chest x-ray, all of which were normal. I did not have a rash around the injection site this time. I was discharged at about 3:10pm

Took 2 Tylenol, went to bed and woke up afebrile. No changes to swelling in arm at this time

I was brought outside and asked to lay flat on the ground and I felt much better. The doctor came out to check on me and said that I looked pale, and that my blood pressure had dropped and asked if this has happened before and if I exercise regularly. After laying down for a little bit, I was guided to sit up slowly as I felt ready. Later that evening within 3 hours or so from the injection, I felt joint pain, and nerve &#34;pinches&#34; throughout my body. This continued through the night and into the next day 2/3/2021. These nerve pinches were mostly on my hands, left wrist, feet, legs, and jumped around a bit throughout my body-shoulder, back etc. I&#39;ve experiences sciatica and other nerve pain before so know what nerve pain &#34;pinches&#34; feel like,

Next day the pain has spread to my neck and ear. On day number three they felt numb, day number four lots of pain on my jaw. Day number 5 I couldn&#39;t even swallow and had difficulty breathing. When I looked in the mirror the left side of my face was very swollen like a ball and my face looked like it was paralyzed. I went to the ER where I was seen, but it remains the same days afterwards. My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

Thursday morning (1/28), symptoms were more mild, but noticed urine was dark. By early afternoon, urine had gotten much more dark and looked to be blood in urine. Went to OB provider who confirmed blood in urine and urine sent out for culture, no infection found. Unknown cause of blood in urine. Headache has continued since 1/27, worse in the morning.

                                                The day of the injection I had a very sore arm, just like my first dose. Then around quarter after midnight, I got up to use the bathroom. I recall extremely vivid dreams, and a little bit of disorientation. On my way back to bed I thought I?d take another ibuprofen to help me sleep because my arm was so sore. I remember feeling very dizzy, I did take my pill, and then I woke up on the floor. I was extremely disoriented and there was a shrill ringing in my left ear. As I came to, I recall really finding relief in the cold tile, and being concerned that I may have hit my head. I did a mental scan of my body and nothing felt painful, though stiff and sore, as I had the flu. I got back in bed and looked at the time, about 20 minutes had elapsed. The rest of the night I tossed turned, and felt quite feverish. I attempted to find radial and carotid pulses, which were extremely weak. That night, I  never did get a temperature, because I was quite disoriented. This morning I?ve been quite stiff and low energy. I feel discomfort in my kidneys, and have taken care to stay hydrated. I have reduced appetite, and some achiness in my body. My temperature right now is 100 even. It?s almost 3 o?clock, so about 28 hours has elapsed. I did not seek further medical care, as I live alone and transportation i would be a hurdle. I also not super concerned, mostly I just want you all to document that I painted, as I have not found that to be listed as a common side effect for the Moderna vaccine. I did call up a friend who is a paramedic, and feel reassured by her two cents.

                                                I am the patient. I do not have the lot number. I received it and was fine initially. I felt a little euphoric in my head. Light headed I guess you could say. After about 10 mins of that I felt a little sensation in my legs. It did not last long. I thought maybe just nerves. After about 15-20 minutes I walked outside to maybe leave. I started feeling a little Soreness (none painful or severe) in my throat. I looked in the mirror and saw two small red patches in the very back of the throat. I looked at my phone to text who followed me and looked back in the mirror to see they had no connected that quickly. With in 10 seconds. I walked back in and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl. I could still breath and had a good air way. My throat a little tight. I remember feeling this euphoric feeling in my head. After about 15 mins of the Benadryl I was getting bettter. I hung around for a little while and left. I know it was a allergy but honestly considered going back for the second dose of that is how it could be handled again. I felt some small dull none painful sharp pains if that makes sense in my sides and stomach that didn?t not linger. Over all it wasn?t so bad. This is my first day however and if more arises I?ll be sure to let you know. I did experience a very sore arm tonight. To even lift it hurt. Worse than other vaccines. I have never had any reactions to other vaccines.

I took an Ibuprofen after symptoms began. I?m not pursuing any treatment because I?m assuming this is just an immune response.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

I woke up around 6 AM the following day and felt extremely fatigued. Around 6:30 AM I became nauseous and very lightheaded. I had to brace myself against a counter so I would not fall down and faint. I rested all day then around 1 PM I got up and fainted. I woke up a moment later and had an intense ringing in my ears for several minutes. I felt fatigued the rest of the day.

Pt stated in was administered in the L arm, but ALERT IIS stated R arm.) After the second dose, she reported immediate nausea, milder than after the first vaccine, and then  &#34;breathing trouble&#34;--a &#34;squeezing heart&#34; sensation that began about 10 minutes after vaccination and lasted for close to one hour. She also immediately began to have pain in her Left arm (the 2nd vaccine dose was administered in her Right arm). This pain has continued to grow and intensify; she called in on 2/24/21 and on 2/25/21 reported that it is even worse. She is planning to go to an urgent care but finds it difficult as she has 5 children at home.

Day 1 - Within 2 hours of the vaccine, I started feeling nausea, headache, extreme fatigue, soreness of the right arm injection site. Chills and temperature developed later in the evening. Contacted employee health to understand the next steps. I was advised to contact again within 48 hours if symptoms persisted for a COVID-test.  Day 2 - Nausea, extreme fatigue, muscle aches, fever (100F), stomach pain, back pain, chills. Later the evening fever continued reaching (104 F). Contacted ER department, spoke with nurse supervisor about my high fever. Recommended alternating Tylenol and Ibuprofen. Advised that current protocol and restated to wait 48 hours.  Day 3 -  Extreme body aches, chills, fever (100-102F), arm soreness, nausea, fatigue.  Day 4 - 6 - Symptoms persisted, headache, fogginess, extreme fatigue, nausea, and low-grade fever.   I contact Employee Health again on Tuesday 2/16/21 and was scheduled for an Employee COVID-19 Test on 2/17/21 at 11:30 am. No additional instructions provided besides getting tested and need to follow-up with the provider if symptoms persist.  Day 7 - COVID-19 Test Results are Negative. However, my symptoms still continued with a low-grade fever (99-100) for an additional 4 to 5 days.

                                                On Feb 22,  2021 I had my annual physical with my Primary Care Dr (PCP), and she noticed my CBC panel reflected low platelet count of 67, so she referred me to a specialist and I made an appointment with a hematologist for March 23, 2021. My PCP told me that if I noticed bleeding symptoms that I should go to the ER. I had no previous CBC panels with low numbers.  On March 14, at 1:30am I noticed petechiae on my face, lower abdomen, and back of lower legs and I had been feeling fatigued the previous 2 days. I went to the Hospital ER and they took a total panel and the CBC panel came back with low platelet count of 24. They admitted me to the hospital for treatment and monitoring.   The hospital administered treatment of dexamethasone for 3 days intravenously as well as intravenous immunoglobulin for 2 days. My body and platelet count responded well to the treatment and I was released from the hospital on March 16 around noon.  During the following days from the hospital I experienced severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, and night sweats until March 20. I still experience extreme fatigue and night sweats.   I had a follow up blood panel on March 19, which showed stabilized numbers. And I had a follow up appointment with Dr to discuss possible causes (one being the covid vaccine due to the temporal relationship) and planning for treatment (follow up blood panel in 2 months and then every 4 months after that to monitor platelet levels).

I reported to my doctor who told me to do cold compresses and hydrocortisone a few times a day and after 3-4 days that went away.  Since the 1st dose on 2/25/2021, I have had random muscle aches in my legs, stiff/sore neck on the left side, and my arm is sore maybe every 2-3 days at the injection site (the arm soreness happened moreso after the 2nd dose though). I also have a stiff toe on my right foot (2nd toe in next to my pinky toe) when I walk on it; when I grab my toe to feel for an injury or check for bruising, there is nothing and it feels normal. It&#39;s only when I walk on it does it randomly hurt throughout the day. I am not certain if this is coincidental or related but wanted to also include this since it started 2-3 days after my 2nd dose.

My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine   I received the vaccine yesterday 1/11/21 at 1135.  About 2 hours later I started feeling symptoms :   Headache dull still.  I&#39;ve been having this pain/ache in my ribs and upper torso of it is crushing inward. My ribs feel like they are being squeezed too hard like a person hugging so tight that you are having difficultly breathing. And the upper torso under my ribs feels like when you have not ate anything in days of hunger pain (but I am not at all hungry) and it start to hurt soo bad that you can only hunch over and hope it goes away.   These issues have been on and off yesterday and today with the dull feel that has not gone away of a 3 or 4 to in a moments notice 8. Currently it is a 3 with a dull squeeze to ribs and barrable hunger pain (I am not hungry).

                                                Approximately 14 hours after first covid vaccine I was nauseous, muscle cramps in whole right arm (the side I was given the shot), migraine, dizzy, trouble lifting arm, redness swelling and pain at injection site.  Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes, but no more than 7 minutes after I received the vaccine I felt odd, like something was about to happen. I felt a bit detached from my body and my surroundings.  I then felt a flush of heat and my throat suddenly closed up. I felt frozen, as if I couldn?t have drawn in a breath if I had wanted to. I quickly removed my mask and sat up in my chair and leaned forward. After approximately 8-10 seconds my throat opened up and I could breathe.  At this time I felt my heart was racing; I could feel my pulse in my neck without putting my hand to my throat. I started to take my pulse at this time and I could feel that my heart rate was beating fast, but was slowing down back to a normal rate. It took approximately 2 minutes for my heart rate to normalize.  I could now breathe, but my throat still felt a little tight, but I wasn?t completely sure. My throat felt as though I had a lump in it and it felt a little difficult to swallow. I wasn?t completely sure it was the vaccination or that I may have been thirsty. I sat for 15 minutes and I felt fine, no other issues. I had to go to a doctor?s appointment where they took my blood pressure (approximately 1 hour after the vaccination) and said that my bp was normal.   I left the appointment at 4:00 pm and noticed that it was no longer difficult to swallow. I noticed that my throat felt different. The feeling of the ?lump? was gone and I could swallow much more easily. It was at this time that I realized my throat had still been swollen. It had taken almost 2 hours from the time of injection for my throat to feel normal again.  I am healthy, have had several vaccinations in the past and have no known allergies. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I contacted my PCP the next day once they were open to describe my symptoms. She said that I should proceed with the second dose next month, but should take some precautions first.   I didn?t alert anyone immediately after the vaccination as I?ve never had this sort of reaction and wasn?t entirely sure of what it was. I was also in route to a doctor?s appointment and figured if necessary, could receive treatment there. My PCP advised me to take 2 Benadryl and a Zyrtec one hour before the next vaccination. She also advised that I wait for 30 minutes in the observation area following the next dose.   It is Monday evening and as of now I have had no other adverse effects. I have had minimal arm pain and no other effects at all.

I couldn&#39;t swallow, couldn&#39;t feel my lips. I went back to where I received the vaccine and was given Benadryl. I waited 30 min and my throat closed again. I was given more Benadryl and I had to wait again. I eventually went home and slept the rest of the day. I woke up feeling like  I was hit by a bus. I was sweating with chills for two days.  I slowly got better. The muscle ache took longer to go away and I was eventually able to return to work on Monday. I was having problems with my throat. The allergy specialist had me doing breathing exercises and it eventually got better.

I had a bad rush where I felt like I was about to throw up, I had a migraine and very flush. I started vomiting. My arms started to hurt. I got hives again and they gave me two more Benadryl. They monitored me for another 30 minutes. They said I got super pale. They tried to give me ginger ale and crackers, but my stomach wouldn&#39;t allow it. They monitored me for a while longer and I felt better. I went home and woke up the next morning feeling terrible. Vomiting, swelling, muscle aches. I was in bed the whole time and I missed 4 days of work. I went back Tues 19th.

She was alert and oriented but appeared to be weak and mildly uncomfortable.  She was observed for almost 30 minutes with resolution of the nausea but remained weak, dizzy and then started to c/o of facial numbness &#34;like I got novocaine.&#34;  She stated it was her whole face including lips and tongue.  She remained alert talking in full sentences.  &#43;facial symmetry, no obvious facial or tongue swelling.  Vitals remained stable.  At that time it was decided to transport her to the ED for continued evaluation.  She was brought from the outpatient vaccine clinic to the ED via wheelchair without incident.

After throwing up, she said her mouth numbness was better, but now her fingers were numb and she felt like she couldn&#39;t bend them. Because she threw up, she was not given PO Benadryl. Onsite EMT called for ambulance so she could go to hospital and get IM Bendryl. Airway was fine the whole time and therefore EpiPen not administered.

                                                The day of my 2nd vaccination, I felt a heavy pressure being forced down on myself. It started as a weakness that begun in my left arm. I felt I had unequal strength and my arm felt numb. This begun minutes after my injection. Soon after the sensation went to my whole body. I had difficulty moving from the chair to a wheelchair. I was moved to a treatment bed and layer down in the supine position. I felt extremely weak and hot. After an hour I was released home. The evening of my injection, I started to become extremely tired. My appetite disappeared and all I wanted to do was go to bed. While sleeping I was awoken due to an heating issue inside the home.  I woke up, tried to eat something, but had no desire to. I went back to bed, after taking some Tylenol. My body was starting to ache. While in bed, I begun to experience severe muscle spasms, cramps, etc. These caused me to cry. I began experience extreme changes in temperature. I went from hot to cold quickly. My mouth became very dry, and the weakness persisted. I began to experience severe pain at the injection site that radiated down into my armpit and left breast and my left shoulder blade. I could barely lift my arm. It feels as though the muscle is very ridge, hard and I have point tenderness. I continued to experience severe fatigue and after waking up this morning around 10am or so, I felt extremely hot. My temperature is reading 100.1 Tympanic. I&#39;ve taken Motrin this time as I have been alternating between the two pain relievers.

                                                approximately 45- an hour after the injection I had some rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

                                                Chills, muscle aches, chest tightness, headache, diarrhea, enlarged lymph node on my left side right under clavicle.   Chills, muscle aches, headache and fatigue began about 14 hrs after injection and continued for about 24 hrs. Headache  and fatigue continued on for 48hrs. Diarrhea probably started about 18 hrs after injection and was very mild throughout the next day. Enlarged lymph node didn&#39;t start until around 38 hrs later and although it has reduced significantly it is still a bit enlarged.

When I got up the next morning at 6am, I realized I had mastitis on my right breast ( I got the vaccine in my left arm.) The mastitis consisted of redness around the areola, pain, swelling, and my lymph node in my right armpit felt slightly enlarged and painful. My fever was 100.9

My fever peaked at 101.2 at 2am. Pain relievers and fever reducers did not help. I had cold sweats throughout the night, not able to sleep consistently through the night due to body aches, headache and nausea. Left arm became swollen, hot and hard to the touch, this lasted through 2/17/21. The arm was itchy from 2/18-2/20/21. The fever and body aches lasted through 2/16 until about 10:15pm, around 11:00pm the headache went away. I was feeling mostly recovered with the exception of the arm by the morning of 2/17.

                                                I started having minor body aches about six hours post vaccine. I woke up that night nauseous and dizzy. I passed out on the way to the kitchen to get water. My husband somehow heard me and helped me back to the bedroom where I passed out again. I was eventually able to get back in bed without passing out, though I couldn&#39;t get warm and had severe body aches for most of the night. It was like having a very high fever, only there was no fever. I was clammy, but no fever. Around 4:30 a.m. the &#39;non-fever&#39; broke and the chills and body aches stopped. I was extremely fatigued for the next two days and felt myself again by the third. The arm in which I received the shot hurt pretty bad Friday too but that was the least of my concerns.   I did not seek medical treatment for these symptoms.

                                                I received Moderna COVID-19 VACCINE EUA. The day after the vaccine my temperature varied from 98.2 to 100.3 degrees, going up and down. Two days after it varied from 97.5 to 99.5 degrees. I experienced pain at the injection site. I felt somewhat nauseous the first day after, and occasionally nauseous the second day. I experienced chills and sweats from 12 hours after the vaccine until 48 hours later. There were moments where my body felt extremely sensitive. Pain shot through various parts of me randomly (not often). The day after the vaccine I was exceptionally tired. I was only awake for a few hours before 2pm that day. (I&#39;m typically awake for 8 hours at that point.) Also, I had a severe headache the day after the vaccine, and a mild headache the following day.

This lasted about an hour then subsided.  The very next morning I woke up with a bad migraine and a headache that lasted consistently for 10 days.  I had intense chills and shaking for three days that started within 24 hours of receiving it.  I also experienced muscle aches and pains, fatigue, nausea and tummy aches lasting about 10 days.

I wasn&#39;t worried because this is well known for side effects from the vaccine but I wasn&#39;t prepared for the heart palpitations and tachycardia I had for about 4 hours the night of 1/5/21. I had COVID in May 2020 and per my cardiologist probably had myocarditis that I am still taking a beta blocker for as a result of the COVID infection. There may or may not be a link between the immune response to the vaccine and my previous COVID complications. The morning of 1/6/21, I am pretty much back to normal.

Immediately following the vaccine I had mild / moderate pain at injection site and muscle soreness at injection site. Roughly 20-24 hours after receiving  the vaccine, I developed moderate headache, fatigue, fogginess, full body aches, nausea and upset stomach. I continued on Tylenol twice daily. After a good night?s sleep, I felt better the following morning and all symptoms had resolved within 48 hours post vaccination.

                                                Upon vaccination, I had mild soreness in my right arm muscle on day 1 and day 2 (I have been reporting to the VSafe app). There were NO other symptoms or side effects including NO redness, lump/swelling, itching, etc.  I felt fine. I woke up Wednesday, January 6th at 8am  to some itching on my injection site. When lifting my shirt to look at it, I found a quarter sized, red swollen lump that was a little sore and hot to touch.  I contacted my hospital employee COVID phone hotline and spoke with a nurse who transferred me to a doctor (11am) I sent a photo and described my arm. Dr. stated that it was unlikely an allergic reaction due to it being 1 week later. She diagnosed me with cellulitis and started me on Bactrim antibiotic. I took my first dose at 8pm on 1/6 and at 2:30am I woke up with stomach cramps and diarrhea. I woke up again on 1/7 with an elevated temperature at 99 and feeling nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, slight body aches and a large, red hot touch spot on my left ankle (I had a spider bite on my left ankle in Sept 2020 that was treated with Bactrim it healed no issues but this flare up occurred same spot). I continued to take the Bactrim (3 pills total since receiving the rx) and still felt sick. I spoke again with a new COVID hotline doctor on the phone APRN CNP who stated she believes I in fact do not have cellutitis but rather an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine and therefore I should cease taking the Bactrim and start Benadryl. I did that at 7pm 1/7 went to bed woke up and my ankle was better as was my arm although you can still see the circle. I followed up on 1/8 with APRN CNP via secure messaging with photos and she stated again I likely am allergic and to monitor.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Two days after my vaccine I noticed some pain in my low back and in my left hand and left foot. I also had one night where I woke up and had soaked through my blankets with sweat. Otherwise, felt fine. On January 7th I noticed that the injection site was suddenly very red and swollen and a dull ache had returned. On the 8th the redness was more filled in and less bright, still swollen and painful. I tried to go paddle boarding and all of my muscles were very weak and I got dizzy and nauseated. I felt like my body was full of lactic acid and that my muscles would not work properly. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and 50mg of Benadryl and got in bed and slept. On the 9th, the redness was almost gone, swelling still visible and muscles very weak, along with a strange tight feeling in my neck and head. My left toes went totally numb. I mainly stayed in bed and slept until the 12th when a precautionary COVID test was negative and I was able to get lab work drawn. I tried biking 2 blocks and felt that my muscles were a little stronger, however my joints felt very fragile and I was short of breath. On the 13th I got some tingling in my left foot and toes went completely numb on 2 occasions. Today, (14th) I do not have the lactic acid feel, however I am very tired and continue to have the head and neck tightness.

                                                there was bleeding at the injection site more than from a typical vaccination I have recieved in the past. I sat to wait and within five minutes was lightheaded, overheated but having chills and having intense abdominal cramps. My pulse ox and bpm were fine but my blood pressure was low for me; normal is 110/70 and emt&#39;s confirmed that I was 90/60 and then 98/62 after 40 minutes post vaccine.  I waited longer and then not feeling worse left. Advil fixed the cramps. So far it&#39;s only been pain at the injection site.

Next day, felt very weak, had headache in forehead and eye area, bit of dizziness.   Throughout day arm got feeling bad and extremely painful with long sleeve on.  Could not move arm due to pain.   Got a bruise in the puncture area, 2 finger underneath got very hard and slightly red, not rash but raised and hard.  Throughout the next day, was going away, and through the night able to raise arm normally, but still had bump and redness until Sunday.  Still slightly red, but has lessened and almost gone, but still has bruise which is not unusual for her.  Also had itching and was painful to scratch, could only lightly touch.  All has resolved.

                                                The morning after the vaccination, I woke up and felt slightly nauseous. When I got out of bed, and went to the bathroom, everything went white and I fell. I was able to get up on my own but had to lay back down. I thought I would be unable to go to work but after resting for about 15 minutes, I was able to get up, finish getting ready for work but continued to get lightheaded if I stood in one spot for too long. I was very tired and out of it the rest of the day, and having chills throughout the day. All of this in addition to my arm being very sore and my back hurt from my fall. I also had a very bad headache, and later in the day, around 430pm, my temp was 100.2.  I took tylenol and went to bed around 630.

                                                Full anaphylactic shock; Hives; Low blood pressure; Dizziness; Stuffy nose; Bad headache; Nausea; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare facility staff member who was a 36-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine, and who developed full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose.  The patient&#39;s medical history included a latex allergy and pregnancy.  Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06-Jan-2021, approximately 30 minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT 01122019) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient received her Moderna vaccine on 06 Jan 2021 at noon.  She reported that approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she went into full anaphylactic shock.  She stated that the reaction began with nausea.  She then developed hives, got low blood pressure, and was dizzy.  She was taken to the hospital.  There, she received two rounds of epinephrine along with diphenhydramine and famotidine.  She was released that same day from the hospital once she stabilized.   On 07-Jan-2021, a full 24 hours after receiving her vaccine, she experienced another anaphylactic reaction.  She stated that the reaction happened exactly like it did on 06 Jan 2021 and presented with all the same symptoms.  Patient injected herself with the epinephrine pen that she had at home as soon as the symptoms started.     In addition to the anaphylactic reactions she experienced, patient reported that she had a bad headache since receiving the vaccine as well as a stuffy nose that comes and goes and coincides with hives.  As of 10 Jan 2021, she stated that the flare ups had finally subsided, however, she continued taking diphenhydramine and famotidine as prophylaxis for anaphylactic reaction.   Treatment for the event included epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and famotidine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events, full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose, was not provided.   The events, full anaphylactic shock and low blood pressure were considered resolved on 07 Jan 2021. The events, nausea, hives, and dizziness were considered recovered/resolved on 10 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the events, bad headache and stuffy nose, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 36-year-old female patient with medical history of latex allergy, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 01122019), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Anaphylactic shock, the non-serious listed events of Headache and Nausea, and the non-serious unlisted events of Urticaria, Hypotension, Dizziness, and Nasal congestion.  Based on the current available information and temporal associon between the use of the product and the onset of events starting on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                I felt a pain shoot through my arm to my hand as I was being given the shot, then my arm and shoulder were very sore. I was unable to tolerate sleeping on my left side that night and I had a bad headache. My arm is still sore now but I can tolerate pressure on it better. Yesterday around 1:00 pm, the day after the shot, I began having some itching along the back of my neck near my hair line. By around 7:00 that night my neck continued to itch, I was not scratching however, but also my upper posterior neck into my hair line became red, hot, swollen, and painful. It spread equally across my posterior cervical spine from the base of my head to about C7 level (pics taken). My headache worsened and pain spread all the way down my spine to my lumbosacral region. I still have these symptoms now but to a lesser degree. I feel nauseated today as well and had to stay home from work and contact my doctor because of these symptoms.

                                                Around 6PM the evening after receiving the vaccine my arm became noticeably sore and I began to feel achy all over.  I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

                                                Beginning the night of the 27th, I had a headache and a low-grade fever. I woke up in the middle of the night with a 102.7 fever, severe migraine, severe body aches, leg cramps, sore throat/swelling, and chills. I alternated taking ibuprofen and tylenol to try to control the pain, to no avail. I used bengay and cool washcloths for pain and to cool off. These did not help either. I made sure to keep drinking water and pedialyte. I took benadryl to try to sleep and help with my throat swelling up, it did not help.  All of this was non-stop until the morning of the 30th. That morning when I woke up my fever was going down and I no longer had the chills. I still had the severe headache, body pains, cramping, swollen/sore throat, and now diarrhea. Today is 2/1 and I am still experiencing severe body aches, severe headache, leg cramps, &#34;nerve pain&#34; type feeling in my arms, GI issues, and a sore/swollen throat.

By 3 am was up again vomiting. That lasted a few hours. Temp hovered around 101-102 all day (alternating Tylenol 1000mg and Motrin 600 mg q 3 -4 hours). Could not get out of bed all day.  It was pretty intense. By evening the N/V subsided but the other symptoms remained. Temp broke by 10 pm.  The next morning temp was normal, chills were gone, still had the migraine (which migraines are not unusual).  Felt fatigue and body aches, but was functional. By the evening joints hurt so bad could barely walk again. Cont. next page....

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

Couldn&#39;t have a full visit to dr on the 4th.Tested for COVID on 4th; Negative result. Couldn&#39;t go back to work until the 7th. I was completely exhausted, no appetite; muscles aches; had a bit of a headache, too, but the fatigue was so overwhelming that I just slept for those three days 5th, 6th, 7th. I went back to work on the 7th - it was rough but over the weekend I started doing better and the following week was better for me.

                                                Moderate to severe lymphadenopathy in the neck/under chin and affecting throat. Swelling caused moderate pain and mild difficulty swallowing with mild breathing obstruction/discomfort. Onset of symptoms was roughly 10-12 hours post Moderna injection #1. Symptoms abated somewhat with Benadryl and NSAIDs. Raspy voice, pain in neck/chin jaw from swelling, visible swelling of lymph nodes and discomfort (somewhat positional) when breathing, swallowing, speaking. Night #1 was severe. I may have gone to the ER if I was not so immunocompromised. Day 2 was uncomfortable/painful but better with NSAID use. Night 2 had increased swelling and pain that improved after taking Benadryl and Singulair and nightly dose of Celebrex. Day 3, I am a bit uncomfortable with mild pain and visible swelling, but improved from Day 2.

I was also feeling a bit nauseous but I thought it was stress but I did took an ibuprofen.  Later I starter to feel very tired do I went to sleep like about 7pm and I took a Tylenol before doing so.   I kept on waking up in the middle of the night still feeling pressure pain in my head and like a tightness sensation with a slight pain on my chest.   I woke up at 5am to get ready to work and I was still not feeling well. I got out of the house and stoped at a gas station and when I got out of the car, I started to feel extremely dizzy while walking. Got to my work place and took my temperature and it was 99.1. After a while dizziness and pressure on chest kept on getting worst.   I had someone at work take my vitals and my temperature was 101.0,  BP was 144/95, BPM was 120,  SpO2 was 98%. My boss send me home. And now I?m having mid and back lower pain with a bit of chills

I recovered very quickly, the illness lasted about 24 hours. Five days later (1/28) the same exact thing happened only worse, I experienced all symptoms listed above in addition to vomiting and extreme dizziness.  Again, my symptoms subsided pretty quickly but then 24 hours later I became achy, fatigued and developed a minor cough with shortness of breath.

                                                After she received the vaccine she started to feel itchy and had redness at injection site.   She remained itchy for several days, but it would come and go.  About two weeks after the shot; she started to break out into hives on her arms, then spread to her legs, back and head.  Her palms got red.   She took claritin and it gave her short-lived relief.  She got prescribed a medrol dose pack, she completed two packs and still no relief.  It helped while she was on it then symptoms came back once she stopped.  She has an itchy throat, swollen face.  She also has diarrhea.  Symptoms have no been for over a month and seem to be getting worse.  Following up with an allergist and her PCP today.   Dr. then prescribed Solu Medrol, IV which she had last week. While, she was receiving the treatment, she felt better.   As soon as the IV was done. She started to break out again.  Today she came into work, and her eyes were blood shot. She also has pressure in her chest and has a hard time swallowing.  She had hives on the inside of the mouth, and alongside her tongue.    She will be seeing an allergist and an infectious disease in the upcoming days.

                                                Currently pregnant - 36 weeks, 4 days day of the vaccine. Due date is 3/11/2021 but will be induced on 3/4/2021 because I am 36, no other underlying health conditions. Allergic to Cipro and Sulfa medications. Currently taking prenatal and 50 mg of Zoloft. Waited the 15 mins and felt fine; driving home about 30-40 minus after vaccine, swallowing felt difficult and tongue began to swell slightly. I went to my primary care; they said my throat looked clear but tongue was slightly swollen. I was given Tylenol extra strength (2 pills) and 25 mg injection of Benadryl in the left arm.  Encouraged to still get the second dose and take Benadryl prior the vaccine as well as go to the primary office to be observed after the shot.

Experienced fatigue, fever and nausea for 48 hours after shot. I was experiencing rapid HR for 48 hours. Contacted doctor they thought I had an allergic reaction to second dose so I did take a benadryl and it did seem to help with my heart rate. I am still experiencing headaches that come and go after a week of getting my second dose. I have been extremely fatigued more than usual as well.

The migraine started about 1100 on Feb 23rd (next day after vaccine) and lasted until the next morning.   After taking Advil with caffeine, the symptoms began to subside.

                                                About six hours after receiving the vaccine I felt fatigued. Two days after receiving the shot I began having symptoms in addition to extreme fatigue, including nausea, low fever, headache, and muscle aches. Now it is 11 full days after the vaccine and symptoms have not abated at all. The doctor ordered a Covid test and blood work. They also prescribed zofran and meclazine which have not helped. It has been difficult trying to advocate for myself without coming across as an anti-vaxxer or conspiracy theorist. I wish doctors would believe me when I say this is caused by the vaccine. I am not an anti-vaxxer and was enthusiastic about getting the vaccine, but now I am frightened by my body&#39;s reaction to it.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

By bedtime I was doubled over in pain.  That lasted for several hours before my husband took me to the ER.  They found that my appendix was going to rupture and took me to emergency surgery.  I never had a problem with my appendix before then and have never had another major surgery (only other surgery was ear tubes as a child).

                                                I received the vaccine on 12/29 at about 2:15pm. I had a sore left arm after shot which awoke me at 2am. I also work up due to fever (temp 100.1 ), chills, and myalgia. I had a lot of trouble sleeping that night and got very little rest as unable to get comfortable. The next day I still had fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, joint pain, low back pain, fatigue and headache (felt similar to prior bad flu symptoms). I was sent home from work early as symptoms continued throughout the day with a little relief from a 500mg of acetaminophen. The following day 12/31 symptoms were gone except for the left sore arm which was improving and now completely done on 1/3.

I alternated Tylenol and Ibuprofen which took over an hour to have any impact on the fever.  I have used ice packs to also control my body temperature throughout the night.  I woke up with fever and have run fever all day 1/3/21.  It is 4:49 PM and it is currently 101.4 which is 20 minutes after my Tylenol has worn off.  I am also experiencing intestinal issues and started having diarrhea at 3:30 PM on 1/3/21.  I am very concerned about taking dose 2!

                                                About 34 hours after receiving the vaccine I started with severe stomach pain followed by vomiting every 20-40 min until 8:30 am; Following the vomiting I was still incredibly nauseous and still have intermittent stomach pain. I have NEVER had a vomiting episode like that ever in my life. I called my PCP at 8am and asked for a prescription for an anti-nausea medication which I have taken 5 doses of since receiving on 01/5/2021 at 12:00 PM. I&#39;d like to state that other then going to receive my vaccine I have not been around anyone to have gotten a stomach bug. My husband whom I live with did not start throwing up either so I don&#39;t think it was anything I could have passed to him. I don&#39;t know that this was caused by the vaccine however I did want to report it incase. I am having the 2nd dose on 2/1/2021.

I have also had severe chills, nausea, vomited twice, generalized weakness and shakiness.  It is currently 12:10pm on 1/8/21 and these symptoms continue.  Two of my other co-workers were at this same facility at the same time on 1/7 and have had very similar symptoms as well as severe headache which prevented them to work today.  We are all physical therapists, healthy young individuals, no co-comorbidities and were very surprised by these negative reactions and concerned.

It was significant until 1/13/21. I was unable to do any task that required engagement of those arm muscles. I also had fatigue (2 to 3 naps a day) and loss of appetite. I missed 2 days of work 2 days after vaccine. I took 600 mg to 800 mg of ibuprofen and used an icepack.

She did not think she was pregnant. On Thursday 1-7-2021 around 4 AM she started experiencing severe abdominal pain. She did not go to work that day but did go in on Friday 1-8-2021. On Saturday 1-9-2021 she woke up with significant vaginal bleeding. On Monday 1-11-2021 she went to the OB/GYN and there she had a positive pregnancy test. The diagnosis of miscarriage was made at that time. A couple of days later, a repeat pregnancy test resulted in a negative reading.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the injection, I developed a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt a bit light-headed and woozy. I informed the staff at the site that I felt this way and they asked me to remain for additional monitoring. Over the next 15 minutes, my tongue began to swell. 15 minutes later my jaw began to stiffen and I had difficulty swallowing. After another 15 minutes the staff asked the EMS personnel to screen me and check my vitals. All were normal. After another 30 minutes of monitoring by EMS the symptoms began to subside and I went home.   At home, I began to feel weak and went to bed. My body began to ache and I took ibuprofen to ease the pain. Within 15 hours of receiving the dose, I had a 100.9-degree fever and chills. The fever lasted the next day. I could not get out of bed for the next day. When I tried to sit up and watch TV I had back pain so severe it left me in tears.  I went back to bed and stayed there until the following morning. All told, I could not get out of bed for 36 hours.

                                                Two hours after the injection I experienced increasing soreness in my left shoulder up through the left side of my neck and down through the forearm. I became slightly nauseous through that evening. The pain and tightness got to the point I could not perform regular functions with the left arm. It felt as if my muscles were tearing and prevented me from sleeping. I took ibuprofen in addition to alternating ice and heat to no avail. It hurt to lift my arm, grip to pull or push even a blanket. This continued for 48 hours before there was slight relief. Full range of motion returned four days after the injection. For brief periods throughout the days following, I also experienced occasional slight heart palpitations.

                                                Overnight after receiving 2nd dose of vaccine, patient developed intense body aches, joint pain in larger joints, and chills. Also very vivid dreams, headache and intermittent nausea, but no vomiting. R upper arm at injection site is very tender, but no redness or warmth.  Ibuprofen helped with the aches and chills.   Unsure of exact temp, as thermometer just reads ?low? (think the battery needs to be replaced).   Pt rested, increased fluids, and used anti-pyretics as needed to recover. Symptoms subsided after 24 hours.

                                                Reaction began to develop 8 days after getting vaccinated. The injection site turned red, was swollen and warm and has spread in size for a couple of days. I had a headache for a few days prior to my reaction on Wednesdays and my left underarm hurt. Additionally, swallowing after eating or drinking hurt for a couple of days. My body was weak and I felt feverish despite not having any fever. I am currently being treated by my physician as if I have Cellulitis and was prescribed antibiotics as well as instructed to take an antihistamine with the antibiotic. Today is my first day on the medication so I do not know the outcome yet.

Went ER at 12:55 pm and they did an EKG - not a regular heartbeat; blood work and x-ray. My BP was high - 143/122; I had low potassium; white blood cells higher than normal -10.9 (in mid Nov - only 7.5); They gave me potassium to take. December 30, when I got home at 6:30 - nausea started and I was throwing up two-three  days in a row more than 5 or 6 times a day; weird metallic taste; fever at night; arm pain and swollen under my armpits. (Stayed off work three days.) Went to dr on Jan. 7 - did a follow up appt. and did all the blood work again and everything was back to normal.

Nausea, thirst, headache, chills, body aches, 102° fever, exhaustion, and not being able to move arm where shot was. Also experiencing ear issues again which took almost 3 months to dissipate when I actually had covid. Shot was administered around 1700 on a Wednesday. Felt fine going to bed. Woke up to the headache that quickly progressed to everything else.

At 15 minutes I started to get hot, cough persisted, and a feeling of fatigue (I didn?t want to talk...very unusual). At 30 minutes the scratch in the throat turned to a lump, the cough was worse, and itching began on neck &amp; face. The doctor on site gave an oral Benadryl tablet but in two minutes symptoms were worsening and vomiting started. My chest was tight and sweat began. The doctor administered 50 mg benadryl shot &amp; a steroid. The lump was growing bigger, so they administered an epinephrine. Then I was sent to the ER. Upon arrival I received 25 mg of benadryl due to the whole body itching, but throat had relaxed. Also received IV fluids.

Her symptoms improved with 2 pills of regular strength advil. Her headache went away and she no longer has symptoms today.

                                                I had listed side effects start on 1/22 (the date the injection was administered), starting around 5 pm. This consisted of fever (102), chills, sweats, muscle aches, fatigue, tenderness at the injection site, and headache. The fever (reduced 100ish), muscle aches, tenderness at the injection site, sudden waves of heat flashes, and headache persisted into 1/23. I also had an onset of nausea that evening. On 1/24 I continued to experience a headache, tenderness at the injection site, and sudden waves of heat flashes. However, around 5 pm I noticed my arm (localized to below the injection site) was very red, inflamed, and radiating significant heat. It may have been that way since 1/22, but I didn&#39;t notice. Those same symptoms persisted into 1/25 and I contacted my PCP. I went in for a visit, it was assessed, with no infection noted, and recommendations to watch and belief it would subside. On 1/26 it continues to maintain some redness and radiates heat.

                                                Within 4.5 hours my arm was beginning to become sore. hour 5-6 I felt nauseous and foggy and body aches slowly started. I felt like I didn&#39;t get any rest that night, between the tossing and turning due to body aches and very sore arm. when I woke up I did take some Midol, it was all I had on me at that moment.  From there I still came to work, because I knew we wouldn&#39;t have the staff to cover our department . I had a cycle of symptoms. starting with the major body and joint pains, red injection site with heat. Then I started profusely sweating. Like I had just finished a 90 cardio session. That lasted about an hour-two. and then It started over. I had the same symptoms about 3-4 cycles worth. as soon as one would start to subside another one started. When I finally got home I took Some Excedrin and within 3 hours after that my body aches were very dull and my I could move my arm without throbbing pain anymore. I have now it the 48 hour mark. At hour 45 I started sweating again and my arm is still tender, but hours 4-34 were the worst. I just want to point out I Know the shot is injected high into the muscle, But my injection site was at the very top of my arm/shoulder.

Fever of 101, chills, aches, some nausea, and feeling like my body was on fire at times. I did have to leave early from work due to Advil and Tylenol not improving symptoms. I am however feeling a little better now over 48 hours post vaccine but still have some aches in legs and joints.

I was taken to the ED and given Benadryl, IV fluids and had continued nausea, lightheadedness and developed a headache. After Benadryl the symptom resolved except for lightheadedness and headache. Today I have symptoms very similar to flu headache, lightheadedness, nausea, muscle aches, joint aches and overall fatigue.

                                                I got the vaccine on 30th of Dec. Had a sore arm, runny nose, woke up the next day to puffy eyes and bruises under my eyes (still hasn&#39;t gone away) Since then I have had GI issues. Constipation. It aggravated my face. I had nausea. I had a rash on my arm and on my chest the following Tuesday. My face were tingling and very flush. I had a lot of allergy and sinus issues. Sinus pressure. This all unfolded the first few weeks after receiving the vaccine. I do have fibromyalgia. I had allergy testing done. I am allergic to bee stings. Was having a lot of vaginal issues. Watery eyes and have hot flashes followed by chills. Hives on chest. Difficulty swallowing. Rapid heart rate. I have seen three doctors that have told me my hear rate was fast. Glands have been swollen for two weeks. The night after I got the shot it was really rough with body aches.

                                                I am currently a nursing mother and 24 hours following the vaccine my infant son, born 1/22/2020 (approximately 13 months old) presented with a rash (trunk), nausea and vomiting, lethargy, decreased mobility, and irritability.  Approximately 48 hours following my vaccine he presented with a rash on the backs of his shoulders as well as on each of his cheeks as well as a fever of 101.5 degrees. The fever was treated easily with Tylenol and did not return after the 6 hour mark.  At 60 hours post vaccine, he was evaluated by his pediatrician in person and evaluated. He was specifically checked for ear infection (negative), strep (negative), and COVID-19 (results not in yet). After the care provider&#39;s assessment it was determined that a report should be made regarding the incident and that I should contact the CDC regarding his reaction.

Zaleplon insufficient duration so switched to Zolpidem PRN. She has not required more than a few doses of zolpidem but now we have uptitrated her to gabapentin 600mg nightly. She feels significant improvement in her sleep and work product, but continues to have intermittent cognitive errors and some decrease in work performance, that remain concerning to her.

She stated the following symptoms came on &#34;Like a wave&#34;: Dizziness, light headedness, ears ringing, sound pulsing, and her vision began to go black. She described the field of vision closing like that of a loony toons show ending (coming from the outside in).   Patient was found to have her eyes closed, hyperventilating at a rate of 28 breaths per minute. Ice pack placed on her neck. She was coached to slow her breathing, instructed to hold her breath for 10 seconds, then to release it slowly. She did this for 3 minutes. She related her body felt tingly all over. Encouraged patient to continue the slow breathing. As patient began to feel better, she related that she has a known needle phobia. She expressed that she becomes anxious even when she is not the one receiving a shot, and this fear stems from a traumatic experience of her son having a seizure after a shot. She works at a school and when they do first aid training and cover the diabetes section, the pictures of needles make her anxious. Patient provided with therapeutic communication, encouraged to discuss fears with her counselor. Patient remained seated in clinic until she felt well enough for her husband to drive her home.

                                                During first shot, I got covid arm about 1 week after shot.  After second shot, I had fever, headache and nausea for 2 days-onset within 3 hours of shot. Took 3-4 days to regain strength from fatigue. All of which was to be expected based on literature. However, two weeks later I got hive-like spots resembling a bug bite. They only appeared on my lower left arm.  There are about 20-25 small raised itchy spots. Currently they have been there for 4 days. They are less itchy than onset but get worse with heat or added clothes layers.

The next 8 hours were spent on my bathroom floor, unable to keep even small sips of water down, with continued retching despite having emptied my stomachs content hours previous.

                                                Got red rash on neck, nausea &amp; burning in back of throat right after vaccine injection to the right arm. Later in day, developed pain and weakness going down the entire right arm into the hand and wrist. My right forearm and first 3 fingers were twitching/shaky for 3 days. My neuropathy also flared up (freezing/burning sensation in both hands and feet). Still having some weakness in right wrist 1 week later, and cold/burning in hands and feet but seems to be slowly improving.

I had some itching and discomfort on my abdomen. However, when I went to check Thursday morning, I noticed I had a pretty severe shingles rash. I have had shingles in the past, I am 37 years old. I have not received the shingles vaccine. I have actually had shingles more than once, and had it the first time at 12 years old.  I am currently experiencing the worst break out I have ever had. I have seen a physician who is helping me manage my symptoms as well as possible.

On 27-JAN-2021, after receiving the second dose of mRNA-1273, the patient reported that she experienced nausea, sweating, body aches, and an anaphylactic reaction that was characterized by slow hand movements and facial swelling.  The patient reported that she would see her doctor on 18-Feb-2021.   Treatment for the events were not reported.

Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

Tuesday I woke up within 20mins I was nauseous and threw up multiple times. My body was achy and just felt &#34;blah&#34;. Was weak and dizzy when I stood up. I felt like my insides were on fire (like the worst temperature you&#39;ve ever had) but didn&#39;t have a fever. Felt like my brain was going to swell out of my head and it was the worst headache. I slept all day. Woke up long enough to call the dr and fell back asleep. Halfway through the day I ended up with a fever of 102 (it went down after a few hrs). Today I woke up still feeling weak and somewhat dizzy, spacey.

Advised to go to ER for Covid Test, since I had worked closely with someone else positive the previous week. Husband had to call an ambulance when I couldn?t make it out of the bedroom due to weakness, true vertigo-room was completely spinning and couldn?t keep my balance, and severe vomiting with any upright movement. Covid test negative. ER diagnosed as BPPvertigo because no other outright viral symptoms; only sneezing before; but they noted fluid in my left ear- said wasn?t infected. Told them of headache in back left rear of head, behind ear, and pressure behind left eye. Positive Dix-Hallpike;nystagmus. Vertigo continued, even with medication through Thursday 12/31/20 and turned to dizziness that subsided by Saturday 1/2/21.

Seen by ENT on 1/4/21 due to continuing symptoms; and was misdiagnosed originally by ER- diagnosed by ENT as Acute Viral Labyrinthitis and Vestibular Neuritis. As of 1/6/2021- symptoms continue.   *suspected recovered from Covid March 2020

                                                I  got it at 2pm Friday.  About 2 hours later my arm started feeling sore but not too bad. I did some light yoga and walked on the treadmill for 40 minutes.  Otherwise took it easy that day. Satu I woke up with a slight headache which isn&#39;t unusual for me.  I still had mild soreness in my arm. I did a more difficult yoga workout and then walked 5 miles outside.  Took a shower after and relaxed for a bit. Then had dinner around 5 and within the hour started having diarrhea.  This lasted a few hours during which my arm started gradually hurting more, it was pretty bad. Could barely move it and hurt to the touch even. Shivering started soon after.  I never had a fever or fatigue during all of this. Highest temp was 98.4 with forehead thermometer. I talked to a doctor to put my mind at ease and he said I was having a big immune response to the vaccine, apparently younger adults between 20 to 40 are having bigger immune responses. The second dose is stronger so most are  having these symptoms after that one, but some are having it after the first as well. He also told me I should have taken it easy these past 2 days and that I likely overdid it. He advised that I take motrin or Tylenol, get under blankets to stay warm, and rest. That&#39;s exactly what I did and a little over an hour later I was feeling much better.   I&#39;m a bit freaked out by what the second dose is going to do to me since it is supposed to be worse. Is it safe for me to get second dose?

                                                I was given the Covid Vaccine in my left deltoid on a Saturday morning. I developed severe heartburn/indigestion that day but was unsure if symptoms were related to vaccine. My arm was sore for about 3 days after injection which was a common side effect. After that, my arm felt completely fine although I continued to experience severe heartburn. I made an appointment to see my PCP that following Thursday for the heartburn and he ordered a CT Angiogram to r/o thoracic aneurysm. During the imaging test the nurse injected contrast dye into an IV in my left AC, below the site of my Covid vaccine injection 5 days prior.  That night I began feeling pain in my arm and noticed that my lymph node in my left axilla had become swollen. I ignored the symptom, assuming that it was yet another symptom of the vaccine. 3 days later on Sunday evening (8 days after my initial covid vaccine injection), I noticed that my shoulder on and around the vaccine injection site  was  swollen, very warm to touch and was extremely tender and itchy. I immediately called my PCP. The next day (today), on Monday afternoon. A fine red rash has developed.

                                                The next morning (12/29/20) - I had typical symptoms -- &gt; minimal body aches/fatigue and a sore Left arm  At 6pm (12/29/20) -- &gt; I just finished dinner and all of sudden I felt like I zoned out/passed out for a minute.  When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

                                                On 12/28/2020 at 1930 I had a throbbing HA, nausea, chills, no appetite, body aches, extreme fatigue and low grade fever. Temp was 99.4-100.3. 1 gram of Tylenol was taken that evening, to relieve HA pain. Zofran 4 mg ODT was also taken for nausea. The following morning,  I felt extremely fatigued and had a persistent headache that was not consistently responsive to OTC meds. I developed a fever on 12/29/2020 in the evening. Low grade and ranging 99.3-100.6. Along with fever, my s/s were extreme fatigue, no appetite, headache, body aches, chills. On 12/30/2020, I spiked a Tmax of 101.0 around 11 am. Again, the same s/s were there. I went home from work early.  Same s/s and low grade fever persisted past 7 days, so I called my PCP as well as the Pharmacy where I received the vaccine. On the 10th day after vaccination, I notified my Infectious Disease Dr. He advised me to wait 6 months to 1 year to receive the second injection. He stated that my s/s were likely vaccine related and would go away with time. Fever persists through every day for the month of January 2021, with exact same symptoms. Started to notice Shortness of breath with activity, occasional sharp pain in chest. Presented to ER on 01/09/2021 with chest pain and shortness of breath. Labs revealed Acute Kidney Injury and Transaminitis. Cardiac work-up was performed, all tests negative. I was hypotensive. MD recommended I either get transferred to hospital, or stay in ER for min 23 hours observation for monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure. I received 2 L of Normal Saline. BP eventually began to rise with SBP above 90 and DBP above 40. (Normal BP range for me is 120/60-70&#39;s. Baseline Creatinine is 0.9. Discharged from ER per patient request, after second Creatinine level came down to 1.5. MD advised patient to not return to work for the next 2 business days. Spoke with PCP on 1/11/2021 in AM, and informed him of the events over the weekend. Also informed him that I am still febrile with same symptoms as reported previously. Was told I could not return to work until I was fever free. Was fever free for about 12 hours, until evening of 1/12/2021. MD not allow patient to RTW.

                                                I got the shot on Tuesday. My arm was a little sore but then it got really sore.  By Wednesday,  my arm by the injection site was swollen, red, and really hot. As Wednesday went on, I got really nauseous.  I ended up throwing up starting at around 5:30 pm until 12 midnight off and on. I woke up Thursday with a rash looking thing across my chest and the right side of my neck.  My arm was still sore,  hot and red and now itching.  It had not gone down any.   I felt like crap so I went to the er thinking it might have been an allergic reaction about 10:45 am.  The dr at the er put me on iv fluids,  benadryl and nausea medicine.  The redness and swelling went down a tiny bit while at the er. From Thursday to today, the swelling and redness is almost gone.  It does itch still and still nauseous.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/7/21 with headache and nausea that started within 15 minutes lasting for a few hours.. The next day my right arm was sore lasting about 1.5 days. 2 days later I developed constipation for 4 days. All of that resolved. On Friday 1/15/21  I woke up with the injection site on my right arm hurting again. On Saturday 1/16/21 I noticed a 1 inch circular rash at the injection site that was hot,achy, and itching. This morning 1/18/21 I noticed that the circular rash has increased in size to 3 inch diameter, accompanied by aching, burning, and itching at the site along with dizziness, headache, and nausea.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 10 minutes after receiving vaccine throat began tingling and I noticed my heart rate was 164 on my apple watch.  Notified nursed overseeing the monitoring.  Nurses began hooking my up to monitoring equipment. Heart rate came down to 120.  Nurses noticed flushing in face and blotchiness on arms. After an additional 15 minutes of monitoring, flushing was still present as well as throat tingling (just tingling, no swelling), so nurses sent me to the ER for further monitoring.  Upon arrival to ER temperature was 100.2 F. (Temperature before vaccine was 97 F, no fevers recorded after ER visit).  In ER fluids and zofran were given and was released after two hours of monitoring.  In the evening I experienced moderate pain in the left arm (very painful to lift arm above shoulder level) that lasted about 24 hours.  I also had a mild to moderate headache that lasted about 24 hours, beginning the evening of the vaccine.   I also experienced mild to moderate nausea that began the day of the vaccine (Saturday, 12/26) and was on and off through Wednesday, 12/30.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

Little out of it feeling.  This was pretty much done by 1/1/21. 1/7/21 one week and a day after injection, injection site became raised, hard, inflamed looking  and was itchy. Site was visibly red and raised and had approximate 3 in diameter.  Previously mentioned symptoms began again (waves of hot flashes, nausea, aches).  This lasted at least until bedtime.  Next day, 1/8/21 felt better and injection site, though still hard and red, reduced down to size of quarter.  No further symptoms BUT injection site now as of 1/20/21 still looks like a quarter sized bruise.

                                                Right after I received the vaccine I went into to 15 minute observation area. Once I sat down I  felt a tingling sensation go from my head to my feet. At that point it started radiating in different areas. The lady next me was also having the same sensation. The nurses brought us both back behind the desk. They got my bp which was 158/88.  It was on the higher side. Then a third lady complained of the same sensation and also was taken back behind the desk. The tingling would not stop and was I was advised to walk around at that point. When I did that the tingling became much worse again. I was given an Allegra and started to feel pressure in my chest. Not pain just a weird sensation. They called a Code Blue on me. Which is what they do when you?re in the outpatient part of the hospital. I was placed on a simple oxygen mask and taken to the ER. When I arrived to the ER I was taken off the oxygen and placed on HR monitor lead and a pulse ox. Both the doctor that arrived first to my code and the ER doctor did a neuro assessment. They did an ekg on me which was normal, but was not done right away. The doctor came in to assess me again. At that time I was having more feeling on my left side. He sent me for a head CT which was read as normal.  I was observed and discharged at around 930pm. I do also have anxiety but what I was feeling was not right. I can?t describe but just a weird tingling all over. It would always get worse when ai would get up and walk. That did not stop until around 9pm. I was also concerned with the fact that two other people were having the same symptoms as me. I have not been to work for two days. I had awful pain in my arm,  I?ve had a horrible headache, nauseous, dry mouth, and I?m extremely fatigued.

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was dizzy. I sat down where they had us wait and the dizziness wouldn&#39;t go away. Became difficult to swallow - felt like a lump in my throat. More difficult to breathe then normal. Vitals taken. BP taken. Feeling like I had an epidural. Legs had a sensation like they were going numb and then they went numb. Benadryl injection given. Legs felt like they fell asleep. Waited and within second 30 min timeframe I was feeling a lot better so I left. 2:30 in the morning, my legs were asleep again and the lump came back in my throat and took Benadryl and it went away and I felt fine. I went to work the next day. At 7:00 that evening felt chilled and it came and went. I came up and took more Benadryl and rested.I went to work the next day and I sent a message to my Primary Care DR. - but leg was fine and the lump in throat wasn&#39;t there. On Saturday morning - after 10 days - had a headache that would not go away  (Very severe headache)- took Tylenol 1000 mg it didn&#39;t work. It was very bad Saturday night I took another Tylenol 1000 and Sunday morning it - headache still wasn&#39;t gone. Leg was numb again. This time the leg  numbness was worse than ever had felt. Left axilla - there was a lump/nodule and it was painful. Tried TeleHealth Med and they recommended I go to ER but I didn&#39;t feel good enough to do it. Dr.  I reached out to her and she took the history and she prescribed Prednisone; but wanted me to do a COVID test and Urine sample to see how I was doing before I took the medication so I did it next the day. Urine sample was clean. Prednisone 60 for four days 40 for four days and 20 for four days - On day Prednisone my legs feel fine, but the headache just lingers. On day two of Prednisone she told me to stop the Benadryl. Three days after Prednisone the lump under axilla resolved. I am taking coffee. Headache is still there but not as severe.

                                                Approximately 10 hrs after the vaccine, I woke up very thirsty. When I went to get water, my brain and body felt disjointed. My brain was telling me to walk forward and my legs were stumbling all over as I tried to walk. I went back to sleep and woke up hours later more stable but still with my head feeling very light(not quite dizzy). I was slightly nauseous and just blah most of the next day. I?d get slightly out of breath when talking for awhile. I was in a deep fog. To the point it took a few minute to process the sound my dog made with it coming from him. Overall, I felt like I was drugged or really intoxicated. I worry about my 2nd dose!

                                                On the day of the vaccine I had usual arm soreness. For about 1 hour in the evening I had chills and felt nauseous. I felt fine after that. One week later I woke up and my entire arm was very sore. I thought I slept on it wrong. The pain radiated down my entire arm. Later in the morning, my wrist was incredibly sore and throbbing with pain.  Later that evening I started to rub my arm at the injection site and felt a large, hard bump. I looked at my arm and noticed a red rash in the area as well. I called the Health Dept (who gave the vaccine) and they said to ice it and take advil, which I did. The next day the swelling went down a little bit, but the rash area is much bigger &amp; is not hot to the touch. Today is day 3 of this &amp; the rash &amp; heat are the same. It is less painful than the first day of this reaction.  I googled this and I am seeing people call this &#34;COVID arm.&#34; It does not itch though.

Considered it was a mosquito bite but woke up the following day (Thursday) with the area swollen, red, and hot to the touch.  I also had a stomach ache so I took Tylenol which did not help.  Friday, I took ibuprofen  and the redness and swelling subsided but the heat remained until the evening of Sunday, January 21 when I started having an anxiety attack and noticed a red ring/rash around the injection site.  I took benadryl but it&#39;s still there.  I read that people are calling it &#34;Covid arm.&#34;  It&#39;s not itchy, just a raised red circle/square about 5 inches in diameter around the injection site.  It is still very hot to the touch.  Besides this and severe anxiety brought on by it, I&#39;ve had no other symptoms.

                                                About 5 hours after the vaccine, I started feeling really hot especially in head and face. From there, I had fever and it started going up. Body aches; joint pain; headache; and this went on all throughout that night (Jan 2 and morning of the 3rd). The 3rd, my fever wasn&#39;t as high but I still had fever and felt really really tired and body aches/joint pain. On the 4th, when I woke up I noticed that I didn&#39;t have any taste and smell and so I went in and got tested for COVID 19 (the 4th) - positive for COVID-19.  I went to a clinic that could do a Rapid test. Doctor there gave me Azithromyocin - 2 the first day and one every day after; Dexamethasone once  a day for 10 days.  I could  Tylenol and Motrin (alternating because my fever wouldn&#39;t go down). The highest my fever got was that Saturday night got up to 103 degrees. The last day I had fever was the 5th of January and that was 99.8. Jan 7, 8, and 9th -  I continued to have other symptoms like really severe headache; no appetite; felt super tired and could hardly get out of bed. Those symptoms resolved about the 10th of Jan -  headache almost went away and fatigue was still there and it is still there. I got out of quarantine on the 15th and I went back to work on the 18th - I had no fever. I just felt tired. I couldn&#39;t sleep - throughout. I finally started being able to sleep just a couple of days ago. I had the second dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 30th - I had fever again; body aches; joint pain.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

                                                Swollen axillary lymph node on the same side of injection site (left arm), which was observed 5 days after the vaccination was given and accompanied by moderate pain upon contact.  PCP was seen 12 days after receiving the vaccine as the size of the axillary bump was not decreasing.  Continued monitoring and warm wet compresses were recommended to rule out possible cyst.  The axillary bump increased in size again about 15 days out from vaccination before noticeably getting smaller 3 days later.  It was determined to be a swollen lymph node the next day at the follow-up appointment and continues to decrease in size.  Other symptoms that were experienced were hot flashes within 45 minutes of vaccination that lasted for a couple of hours and nausea the following morning.

                                                I received the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 01:49 pm. Approximately 4.5 hours later on January 6, 2021, I went outside in the cold temperatures. Upon returning inside to warmer air, the bilateral fingertips of both hands were pale white, numb, and painful. The time was 06:30 pm on January 6, 2021. At 06:47 pm, I felt a different feeling in the bilateral tips of my fingertips, and could see the color changing from pale white to a mixture of purple/black.  January 6, 2021 at 06:32 pm was the first time I have ever had my hands respond in this manner to cold temperatures. I have felt one fingertip go numb and turn white for a split second, only one time in my life but it was not a repeat occurrence, and it only lasted for about a second when it occurred. This experience and reaction I currently have lasts from 15-30 minutes of bilateral fingertip numbness and discoloration with pain. The bilateral fingertips of both hands now respond in this manner every time they are exposed to cold temperatures. I signed up for a health checker and did state that I was having this symptom through the Vaccine reporting system on a health checker under ?other&#39;&#39; multiple times. Treatment I received from a health provider are as follows; I had a telemedicine visit on January 14, 2021 at 12:51 pm to address my concern of ?reaction to Covid vaccine, fingertips were numb, lasting 30 mins?. On 1/14/2021, I received a primary diagnosis of Raynaud&#39;s Syndrome by my Primary Care Provider.  On 1/28/2021, I was seen in person by my Primary Care Provider for a Well Visit to complete a physical with my primary care provider. I was provided with a referral to a Rheumatologist for further advice about receiving the additional second Covid vaccination in the series. I also was ordered to do lab work. On 2/2/2021, I was seen by a Rheumatologist for new diagnosis of Raynaud?s Syndrome, and advised that risk outweighed the benefits in regards to receiving the second vaccination in the Moderna Covid-19 series. On 2/3/2021 at approximately 1:45 pm, I received the second Moderna Covid-19 vaccination.  On 2//10/2021, small red, itchy bumps started to appear on both sides of my neck. On 2/15/2021, a bump appeared above my right eyebrow with what felt like a pimple. On 2/21/2021, the ?pimple? had spread towards my inner eye and above my right eyebrow making my right eyelid swell. I received telemedicine care via an e-visit over telehealth with an urgent care and was provided an antibiotic for facial cellulitis. On 2/22/2021, I had one episode of emesis, and went in person to an urgent care. I received a different prescription of an antibiotic, and was provided with instructions of signs and symptoms of what to look for when to report to the emergency room. On 2/25/2021, my right eye started tearing up and the pain began to intensify. I was provided medical care by a Neuro-ophthalmologist and given a primary diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Presently, I have multiple areas of herpes zoster appearing on various areas of my head, shoulder, and chest that do not follow specific dermatomes.

Around 6:30 that evening I got very dizzy and shaky and needed to sit down. The next day I was very tired, had a headache, very foggy minded, an upset stomach, and the injection site hurt bad. I slept a lot that day. On the 1st of March I am feeling tired and have an even worse headache and have had an upset stomach and am tired.

                                                Within 90 seconds I had severe vertigo and a severe migraine.  In about 5 minute the vertigo subsided to a moderate enough level that I could walk to the observation room.  Over the subsequent 30 minute period I started itching and feeling generally awful like the flu and was a bit nauseous. My BP and Pulse were within acceptable limits though so I was released to go home.     As the evening wore on I developed a light rash down my arm. My PCP Dr. proscribed some different OTC medications to halt the allergic reaction I seemed to be having (based on its similarity to some of my food allergy reactions).    I took these treatments for 36 hours.   I woke the next morning with a severe autoimmune flare up that had me unable to get up without a cane for assistance.  I had no fever but felt feverish.  I was in a lot of pain all over. My injection site was very swollen and had a hives ring around it that lasted for about 5 days.   The total reaction from initial allergic reaction through the flare up lasted 8 days. Additionally, I take weekly allergy shots.  Prior to the vaccine I had to reaction to these shots (desired result).  Since then, I have a mild bout of vertigo after each allergy shot (indicating my immune over-response has been hyped up).

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

                                                Patient received a COVID vaccination for her second dose on 3/3/21 at 1538.  She had informed the staff of the clinic that she did have a local reaction following her first dose (9days later) that she saw her PCP for. This was just treated with Zyrtec and no further intervention.  At 25 minutes following her second dose PA noticed that the patient appeared flushed.  He checked with the patient and she said she was ok.  A few minutes later noticed the patient was even more flushed.  At that time went and evaluated the patient - her BP was elevated 150/94 HR of 112 ad Pulse ox of 96%.  The patient reported feeling different than how she felt after her previous injection.  Clinic team offered for patient to be transferred to ER for further evaluation if she would like which the patient accepted.  She was transferred to ER via wheelchair in less than 5 minutes in stable condition with mild nausea.  She was cared for in ER by Dr.  Patient reported feeling tired and &#39;heavy&#39; in the ER.  Dr evaluation found a generally healthy patient with a non-toxic appearance  Lungs were clear and no obvious signs of swelling or other signs of an immediate allergic reaction.  Patient was given oral diphenhydramine and observed until she felt comfortable going home.  Discharged from ER at 1733

                                                Mar 5-2:30pm: arm began to feel sore. Mar6-12:00am  I can barely lift my left arm above chest level. The soreness has traveled from the injection site down to my wrist and fingers. The injection site is slightly pink, not really noticeable, and warm to the touch. I start to feel a little nauseous and also starting to get body aches and chills. From 12:00am-4:00am i constantly wake up because of arm soreness and body aches. At 4:00am, I woke up  to use the restroom and realized even the bottom of my feet hurt with every step I took. Took my temperature and it was at 101.5.  I went back to bed and fell asleep even though I kept waking. At 7:00am, the migraine started. I was trying to avoid taking meds just to be able to get a clear picture of how my body responds to the vaccine, But by 9:30am (22hrs post vaccine) I ended up taking Tylenol for severe migraine. It feels like someone is stabbing my temples with a very sharp object. Turning or even slightly moving my head strengthens the migraine. My arm is still so sore that I can barely move it!  Tylenol brings temperature down to 100.7°. 10:30am I began with extreme fatigue. By 12:30pm I went back to bed because I couldn?t stand my body aches and migraine. I slept until 4:00pm woke up feeling a little better. Migraine was still there but not as bad. At 8:00pm I began to feel pressure on my chest. That pressure slowly turned into pain. By 9:20pm I was in excruciating pain, I was in tears and I literally thought I was going to die. It hurt to breath. I checked into the ER by 9:30pm the pain was sharp and it would come, last a few minutes, then slowly ease off a bit. On a scale of 1-10 if was definitely a TEN!!!! The ER said it wasn?t cardiac so they sent me home. The DR did say that the chest pain could have possibly been caused by the vaccine, as many have seen different symptoms and everyone has reacted differently. I was home by 1:15am. The pains continued until 3:00am. By 8:30am on Sunday Mar 7, the only thing I was suffering from was soreness in the arm and my chest was sore from the pain. The pain in my chest was a 1 or 2 compared to the 10 that it was when I went to the ER, And that pain/discomfort has lingered all day.  I?m currently 22weeks 4days pregnant with a boy and expected to deliver July 7th. I?ve been pregnant 19 times have 4 living children and suffered 14miscarriages.

                                                Per internal reported event: Received the following information from patient via email to Dr.: &#34;Yesterday morning at about 7:20am, I received my first dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at Hospital. I waited 15 minutes in the lobby, felt fine, and left.  While I was still driving, about 7:45am, I noticed that it had become difficult to swallow.  My throat felt swollen.   I decided to stay close to the hospital, and ended up driving to Pharmacy and taking 50 mg benedryl and 400 mg ibuprofen at 8:00am.  I called my primary care provider and left a message, and decided to go to work (started at 9am). I took another 50 mg of benedryl at noon.  My provider called me early in the afternoon, and was unable to give me advice.  He recommended contacting Hospital (vaccine clinic).  I experienced chills in the afternoon, and after I left work at 3pm, I took another 400 mg of ibuprofen, a hot shower, and slept for 3 hours.  I felt much better after the nap.  I reported all of this to the CDC yesterday afternoon through their &#34;check-in&#34; feature.&#34;

                                                I got the vaccine at 9:45am. I got a sudden sharp migraine after 3:15pm, which lasted till around 8pm. Around the same time I also experienced severe nausea, which lasted all night and I woke up with it today. I went to restroom to wash my hands and when I looked in the mirror I noticed 3 hives- 1 on my face under my left eye and 2 on my neck. My left eye was also itchy for about an hr or so.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  Premedicated with benadryl and phenergan prior to injection.  No pain at time of injection. 2.5 hours later, arm started to be sore at site, fever of 101.4, diarrhea x 1 episode. Went outside and fresh air helped, felt much better.  Fatigue and very mild body aches, arm soreness (no more than flu shot, less than tetanus) .  630pm: Acid reflux was the worst side effect I experienced. I asked a co-worker who received the same vaccine the day prior to me. She also had bad reflux. Even with a history of GERD, I do not need to take PPI&#39;s any longer and I needed to take an omeprazole the night of my vaccine, which helped some. Took tylenol 500mg and went to bed. Woke up today (the following day after vaccine feeling normal with arm soreness which got better throughout the day.  I would describe my symptoms as mild. The MD I work with said I should report these to Moderna just so they can track all symptoms that people are experiencing post vaccine.

                                                Client reported tightness when swallowing approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccination, but no shortness of breath or dizziness.  She felt flushing throughout her entire body as well as some tingling. At 7:05 pm, her oxygen saturation was 97% and her blood pressure was 115/80.  She also had red, irregular-shaped  spots on her right, upper arm  (non-vaccinated arm) and upper back.  At 7:13 pm her oxygen saturation was 98% and her heart rate was 111. She then described the tightness when swallowing from earlier as if the muscles in her throat were numbed, which made it hard to swallow, but not hard to breathe. The tightness improved slightly during the 30 minutes that she was observed, but it did not go away. She felt comfortable leaving and knew which signs to look for that would indicate that she needed to seek medical attention.

Sweaty and flushed, nauseated, felt like I was going to faint, then tachycardia and shortness of breath. Nurses told me this was a normal reaction, took my vital signs, and watched for everything to return back to normal, and told me I could report experience to VAERS. Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

                                                Within 30 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I started getting a tingling sensation in my lips and cheeks. It lasted approximately one hour. Felt tired the rest of the day. I awoke at around 2am the next morning with diarrhea, extreme chills and bodyaches, and a headache. My right arm was very sore, but I expected that. I went back to bed and awoke for work at 6am. My injection site was red, puffy, and heat to the touch. My body ached as if I had a bad case of the flu. The next morning, I awoke with nausea and vomiting. It lasted until around 9am.  The aches have eased up, but I remain very tired and my injection site is still very red, puffy, and warm to the touch. It feels as if there are knots under the skin.

                                                6 days after vaccination, I started to feel ill. Throat slightly scratching, almost like I was getting a cold. Then it went away. 7 days after vaccination, same thing, started to feel a little ill. Developed an itch at injection site. Nothing could be visually seen at the injection site. Within a few hours, half dollar sized round res spot appeared, with knot under it. Warm to the touch. Felt like a sunburn, with a knot under it. Day 8 after vaccination, woke up with double the size of circle at injection site. By end of day, pounding headache on left side, felt nauseous and unwell. Injection site itchy, warm to touch and began to grow in size. Went to urgent care. Once there, injection site was about the size of a baseball. Dr stated it was a reaction and prescribed an antibiotic and oral steroids. He noted how hard the knot was and was worried about cellulitis and infection. He told me to report this delayed reaction and advised me to not get a second dose. Since being there, about an hour ago, I feel worse. Ears are ringing loudly, increased headache, and almost a wet feeling at swollen injection site.

                                                I had burning at the injection site immediately after receiving the vaccine. As I was leaving after 15 minutes I mentioned it to the person checking me out. At this time we noticed redness and hives starting at the injection site. I was told to sit for another 15 minutes but as soon as I sat down again the hives spread rapidly and I began to have dizziness and confusion. At this point I was taken to the ER and on the way I started having nausea and my throat started burning and felt tight. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl, Pepcid, and solumedrol and IM epinephrine. Since discharge I had one instance of hive and facial swelling and continued to take Benadryl for two days. I am now having episodes of shortness of breath and tachycardia.

                                                Received at 12:15pm. Other than a slightly sore arm nothing until 6pm.  Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine last Thursday (1/14/21) at clinic and had a pretty severe reaction within a few minutes of the receiving the vaccine. I didn?t alert anyone because I wasn?t sure if it was related to the vaccine or not. I felt hot suddenly, then very dizzy/faint, then experienced very bad tinnitus and couldn?t hear any of the words being spoken around me, just muffled sounds. I felt slightly nauseous, was seeing spots, and felt very close to fainting. My pulse was racing. I did deep breathing  until it subsided (which was about 10 minutes later). For the next 5 days after the vaccine, I experience extreme soreness and weakness in the left arm where the injection was given. I also had redness and itching and it was hot to the touch and slightly swollen. I had extreme fatigue and a headache and a loss of appetite. After 5 days, those subsided. 1 week after the vaccine (01/21/21),  I experienced intense itching at the injection site and redness and it was hot to the touch. I also experienced intense itching on my chin and skin numbness in that area of my chin. The chin area resolved after about 4 hours. The arm itching did not resolved. i woke up on 01/22/21 with the entire left shoulder area swollen, red, hot to the touch, and extremely itchy. it lasted all day. I woke up on 01/23/21 and the swelling had gone down, but the redness spread to a larger area on the upper left arm and the itching persisted all day. I woke up on 01/24/21 and the redness and swelling was almost gone but the itching was still there and the area that had swollen up felt very bruised, but no visible bruising. Today (01/25/21) there is no more itching or redness but the bruised sensation continues.

                                                In anticipation of side effects from the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I began alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen.  The expected arm soreness set in after a few hours.  I also noticed that I had developed a headache and  low back pain that I could not associate with anything else.  I felt very stiff and my legs and feet were uncomfortable to the point that I had difficulty finding a good sleeping position.  This morning I had mild waves of nausea but was able to avoid throwing up.  The headache has persisted, as well as general body aches and fatigue.  As the day has progressed, the symptoms have lessened.

The following morning I began experiencing moderate aches and pains, generalized malaise which resolved quickly with Tylenol.  As the progressed, the achiness and increased and did not resolve quickly with Tylenol.  By 2:30 pm that day, I experienced chills that did not stop, and pain in the bones of my legs that felt like flashes of extreme heat, especially on the femur.  I began experiencing nausea. That night I was unable to sleep more than 3 hours.  Around 1 am of January 27th I began feeling chills, and pain once again.  I took Tylenol, and after a short while I began sweating.  Generally, the pain, chills, and burning sensation stopped that morning, however the nausea continued through the day, especially after trying to eat.

Due to a combination of pregnancy (delivered 2/2014) and subsequently two Morena IUDs, I have not even had spotting since 2013.  For three days, I had period-like blood and cramping.  I reported this during my routine rheumatologist appointment who told me to report it here. Additionally, I had pain in the arm for three days as expected from the literature about side effects from the trials.  I am scheduled to have my second dose on 2/4/21 and will report any other side effects.

At 36 hours I had nausea and at 48 hours I had severe nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramping, chills. I felt improved Thursday but then felt similar again Thursday night. If I eat my stomach cramps and eventually have diarrhea. I had aching and stomach cramping yesterday still 10 days post vaccine. I?m unclear if this is vaccine related.

                                                The next two days I had a sore arm. But a week later, the following Monday and Tuesday, I had fatigue and headaches. I put the date as Wednesday because that is when the concerning possible reactions began. I woke with clogged ears feeling very sick. I took Advil Cold and Sinus and arranged to miss work. It felt like a possible ear infection in my left ear. Also my forearms were painfully sore. I had lifted a heavy box up the stairs the afternoon before but the pain in my arms was immeasurably more than ever expected. My ankles were also very tender as I had done a little jogging the day before and I normally walk. As the day progressed I was barely able to get out of bed. Sleeping and just laying there. My highest temperature was 101.25 at 2:45 pm. I had severe chills on and off. I reported these afflictions and was mailed a covid test by Thursday. The test came back negative by Friday evening. Wednesday night my whole body was tender and I had no appetite. I took tons of vitamins and drank tonic tea and took advil and nasal allergy medication. I am still using all of those. Thursday I woke drenched in sweat. My head was mostly cleared just a wet ear and I had a low grade fever on and off through the day. Just touching my body against a surface was painful. Or putting my hand on my hip. My forearms and ankles were no longer worse than the rest. I received my covid kit and taking it to be mailed was the only time I left my house. I was surprised to find extreme difficulty walking down the stairs with muscle strain and pain in my joints. I was not nauseous but had no appetite. Friday I woke up hungry and felt better. No fever. Fatigue and body tenderness but it was better. Saturday my body is only sore on my glands and jaw and back of head. And my muscle is sore in my left arm. The oddness of that being where my shot was given is what makes me wonder if it was an extreme reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it is a flu. I have never had the body pains I try to describe before.

It seemed to decrease/normalize the following two days.  On Saturday (1/30/21), her heart rate became elevated again. Other symptoms the patient experienced included: feeling a sense of burning inside, nausea, shaking and sometimes short of breath. Patient went to the ER on Saturday and treated for an allergic reaction. On 2/1/21, the patient started developing a rash and became itchy. Patient followed-up with PCP and again prescribed medications for an allergic reaction. It was also recommended for patient not to receive the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                I had previous anaphylaxis events that were treated and did not require hospitalization. I brought epinephrine pen and premedicated with Xyzal 5mg 9 hours before and Benadryl 25mg 1.5 hours before vaccine. 20 minutes after vaccine I felt flushing, nausea, low blood pressure. They had released me from the drive through vaccination site and I was driving and felt panicky, so I pulled over. I waited 10 minutes because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was anaphylaxis or not. I felt OK after 10 minutes, so I drove to nearest ER and waited in parking lot several hours then drove home. I probably should have administered epinephrine and called 911 when I had that reaction. Continued with 25mg Benadryl every 4 hours and nightly Xyzal 5mg. The next morning (24 hours later)  I woke up scratching my face. I had a diffuse sandpaper rash all over my head and neck and was very itchy. Doubled my dose of Benadryl to 50mg every 4 hours. Also took 400mg of quercetin. The itching resolved and the rash was gone the next day, which was 48 hours after vaccine. I was fatigued for several days but fatigue is my baseline as a narcoleptic plus I was taking benadryl. I continued the Benadryl for a total of 4 days. I normally do not develop rashes unless I rub against hay and I did not have any contact with hay.

She had started a new medication 1 day prior to her symptoms (Jan 22) so assumed it was due to that. She stopped the medication after 2 doses.  Her vomiting continued with only minimal improvement. On Feb 4 she was seen in the office and diagnosed with acute hepatitis. She has already had her vaccines for Hep A and B.

                                                Day 1: 7 hours after the vaccine shot, I experienced mild fatigue and chills. Overnight, I had night sweats and insomnia. (Night sweats are a symptom that started after the first vaccine shot, and had dwindled until the second brought them up again).   Day 2: The next morning, I experienced intense fatigue, dizziness, chills, fever, headache with light and sound sensitivity, nausea, and intense fatigue. I was unable to get out of bed most of the day. I could not sit up without intense effort to even drink water. At approximately 11am, I took 600mg Tylenol, then was able to sleep for 3 hours. When I woke up my symptoms were much better, though I still had mild fatigue and achiness.   Day 3:  I was mildly fatigued but otherwise felt good.   Day 4: I awoke with a series of small rashes on my torso (front, back, and sides), as well as my inner arm. They were red, flat, not raised, and mildly itchy, One was around my umbilicus, a few under my breasts, and other splotched in random other places on my torso. My inner ears were also mildly itchy. I put generic rash cream on the rashes on my torso and arms, and the itchiness subsided. The redness decreased throughout the day, though they were all still visible by evening.    Day 5: I awoke and my entire torso was bright red *except* the places where the rashes had been the day before, which were normal skin color. Ears are itchy again, and skin is very mildly itchy. Other than that, no other symptoms. No trouble breathing, good energy.   I have never had rashes or an allergic reaction like this before. I assume it&#39;s an allergic reaction, due to the itchy inner ears and skin.

                                                She had pain in the injection site Tuesday night and then during Tuesday she got worse with nausea and some fever.  By Wednesday she was complaining that she could not pee even though she was drinking a lot of fluids.  She continued to complain it was the worst she ever felt and then at 0600 Thursday morning she woke us up and said she needed to go to the hospital.  We arrived at the hospital just before 0700 and she immediately threw up in the trash can.  We went into a treatment room and they took blood and started fluids as she became incoherent.  She said she had taken Tylenol so they started a drug to counter that but her liver function was all wrong and they started to look for a hospital that could transplant a liver.  She was air evade about 0930 to Medical center and just over 30 hours latter she was dead.  There is a pending autopsy.  She was a healthy 39 year old mother who got the shots because she worked as a surgical tech and she was the single mother of a 9 year old little girl.

I was talking in my sleep a lot which is something that I never do. The next morning severe migraine, nausea, my spine hurt, extreme fatigue, only spine was sore but it felt very hard to move my body - like I was moving in slow motion. I was back to having trouble forming sentences and finding correct words. These symptoms were far more severe than my actual COVID symptoms when I was sick with that. I had no appetite. That lasted all day. Tylenol - took that and did go to work to see two patients but should have stayed home. When I woke up the next morning (third day after the vaccine) I felt fine except for lingering fatigue. The fatigue was gone by the afternoon on Friday (the 29th).

                                                Event: Allergic reaction on 3/24. The injection site began to itch around 9:30pm after taking a hot shower. Approximately 10 minutes later the injection site area swelled and became &#34;hard&#34; to the touch, then turn red, hot, and tender to the touch. The area affected was approximately 3 inches wide and 4 inches long - it covered the upper arm (deltoid muscle area). Within 5 minutes the itching sensation spread over the upper back on the left side and to the left side of my neck. Approximately 20 minutes later my bottom lip on the left-hand side swelled slightly and turned red and I had a slight difficulty swallowing. My breathing was not impeded. The reaction did not progress further (I had taken allergy medication to stop any further reaction). By 11pm the difficulty swallowing disappeared and the swelling in my lip reduced. By 5:30am I had no trouble with swallowing and there was no facial swelling. The swelling in my arm was reduced by half - although it was still warm, sensitive, and itched. Throughout the day (on 3/25) the swelling and redness at the injection site reduced. Two days after the start of the event, the area is still warm to the touch and will itch on occasion as will my lower left lip.  Treatment: as soon as I recognized it was an allergic reaction, when the area swelled, I took half a Wal-Zyr 10mg tablet (so I took 5mg of Walgreen&#39;s generic brand of Zyrtec) - approximately 9:45pm on 3/24. I took the other half (5mg) of the tablet at 5:30am the next morning on 3/25. No additional medication has been taken since.  Outcomes: The reaction was managed with the Wal-Zyr medication. Currently the injection area is slightly warm and itches on occasion, as does my lower left lip. There has been no change in this condition in the past 20 hours.

I was in the middle of treating a PT. Scratchy throat; mild cough; persistent moderate headache; runny nose; diarrhea; very pale. Never had a fever. I had weird neurological side affects (didn&#39;t lose taste or smell  ) issues with facial recognition - didn&#39;t recognize my own face and finding words for every day objects and making sentences was difficult . I was easily winded and had tightness in my lungs. I called Public Health office - and asked them what to do. She told me to go home. Dr  (telehealth visit) told me to take a test in the parking lot that day for COVID January 6. Treatment  - none. All o f my symptoms lasted until Friday January 8 except being winded and fatigued. Those last two symptoms lasted until January 19.  Verbal issues also lasted until the 19th of January. Facial recognition came back around January 12.  On January 27 I had second dose.

It is 4:18 p.m. now. The temperature is now 99.1, with the aide of Tylenol and ibuprofen alternating, the headache still exists, as does the soreness. There is a hard knot at the injection site with about a half inch wide diameter of a red circle around the injection site.

I had several fingers turn white, numb and cold to the touch.  I&#39;ve never had this happen previously and now had it happen 4 times each within days of the Covid vaccine.  After the first vaccine, once I was a week out, symptoms disappeared.  Running my hands under warm water, symptoms disappear.  Right now I just picked up a glass of ice water and even typing my fingers are slightly numb.  Once I see how long these symptoms last I&#39;ll submit a separate event for the second dose.

                                                40 minutes after injection my tongue and throat began to swell and then close.  I had no saliva and could not swallow without sipping on water.  I stopped at a clinic to be near a facility in case I could not breath anymore.  They watched me for a bit (though I did not fully &#34;check in&#34;.  The doctor suggested I get checked at an ER.  I went to ER and sat in the ER parking lot for two hours waiting to see if my symptoms got worse.  I did not want to use the ER unless I felt like I was in dire need.  After the couple of hours my symptoms weekend (but were still there).  I went to a friends place to not be alone in case the swelling increased again.  The next night I felt back to normal.  I have never had that reaction to anything, so I was a bit scared.

Awoke dehydrated, extreme muscle weakness unable to walk or stand, light headed, nauseous, dizzy, unable to grip or exert force. Felt like head was detached from body due to extreme pressure on neck. Rapid resting heart rate in 90s (usual testing HR in 50s).   Constant rolling waves of abdominal cramps brought dizziness with each cramp, acid reflux, bloating and gas.  These symptoms lasted through the evening of the 3rd into the 4th. Considered going to ER for help, as extreme dizziness and muscle weakness prevented walking.

Diarrhea has subsided, less pressure on neck and less dizziness. Feeling exhausted overall. Fall asleep easily and randomly.
