                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

                                                Beginning 1/11/2020, I began experiencing an uncomfortable sensitivity in my left axilla. I have a history of  inflamed lymph nodes that occurs 1-2 times a year under the arm and in the groin, and this felt similar to those episodes. The lymph node is hard to touch and the sensitivity continues today. Today (1/13/2020), I noticed an inflamed, red patch of skin that is hot to touch over the region where the injection occurred. Additionally, I have experienced diarrhea 1-2x/day for the past two days.

                                                Immediately after receiving the shot my left arm started to become numb and tingly, it felt like it was falling asleep. This went away after an hour. Then during the night at 1 a.m. I woke up and the same feeling of numbness was happening in both my left arm and leg. This then shifted to my right side, then just to my hands and feet. During this I was also experiencing the noted Covid vaccine side effects of fever, chills, headache, body ache, weakness, and nausea.

Next morning I woke up with chills, terrible headache/migraine, high fever up to 103.3, cough, aches, neck and back pain, nausea, and vomited one time. No Tylenol or Motrin would break my fever all day long.

                                                At 0200 approx 10 hours after my vaccine I spiked a fever of 101. I had been taking Tylenol every 6-8 hours in hopes to avoid this. Later that morning I was light headed, fatigued, sore throat, nausea. The fever continued to increase. By 2200 that day my fever was 104.7 and that was with Tylenol on board. I also iced my groins and axillary areas to help cool my body. Today is the second day out from the vaccine and I have recovered from the fevers. My fever early this morning was still 102.5 but has since passed and I am normothermic. I am very fatigued with some chest pains.

Was itchy the previous day but not as severe. Swelling and redness not going down with  ice pack. The red circle around the vaccine site is about 2 inches. I am monitoring if it gets bigger.

                                                I was very sore at the site of injection around 6-7 PM. At approximately 1:00 AM, I started experiencing a fever (101.3 F), chills, aches, and some heart palpitations. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen, which helped to reduce the fever and chills.  When I woke up, I was nauseous, had a serious headache, fatigue, minor chills, a fever (101.3 F) and more noticeable heart palpitations (when measured with my smartwatch, it reported bpm of 118-124). I had a virtual consult with a physician who advised me to be seen by urgent care immediately.

                                                Within 12 hours, I experienced moderate to severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In addition, within 24 hours I was experiencing fever &gt;100.4, chills, extreme joint pain and swelling along with enlarged and swollen axillary lymph nodes on the L side. I was extremely fatigued and nauseated for more than there days. Since then, I have had abdominal issues including acid reflux and nausea.

                                                I first started feeling very cold around 5:00 PM that day. Once I went home I went to sleep around 10:30 and work up at 2:30 AM with vomiting and 8/10 epigastric pain that radiated to my back. I went to the hospital. They gave me morphine and Zofran but within 5 minutes of the first dose of morphine, my pain returned even more intense and I still vomited 20 minutes after the Zofran. So they pushed another Morphine and Zofran. Zofran helped at this point but the Morphine did not. At this point they gave my three different oral liquids to help calm down my epigastric region, including mylanta, lidocaine and a third medication. I went home and slept the rest of the day but Wednesday night I got diarrhea and spike a fever of 102.7 around 8PM. Now it&#39;s thursday morning and I still have a 2/10 epigastric pain, physically exhausted and had a fever this morning as well.

I ended up throwing up around 4 am on Thursday 12/31/20 at work. Then over the weekend I  felt very lethargic, had body aches, and the hot flashes continued. My left arm hurt as expected, but the soreness went up into the left side of my neck as well. Today (1/3/21) is the first day since I got the vaccine where I no longer have a headache and feel basically back to baseline.

                                                Starting on 1/12/21 about 24 hours after vaccination, I felt very severe flu-like symptoms.  I had nausea, chills, felt very lethargic and sore to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand at work, and had a pounding headache.  The site where I got the vaccine was also more tender and sore than usual after a vaccination.  I left work early around 3 pm, took 400 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and tried to get as much sleep as I could.  By 6 am on 1/13/21, all these symptoms had gone away, but now I&#39;ve noticed a very swollen lymph node just above my left clavicle.

At this time I took Tylenol. With the fever came a head ache. My injection sight is very painful. I did not sleep very well. When I woke up at 7:00AM my fever was 100 degrees. It has stayed at 100 degrees until this point (1:30 PM). My headache became painful enough that I took 2 excedrin that have relieved most of the headache. My symptoms are improving as the day progresses. My injection site is still very painful. With the normal flu vaccine I get yearly I have never had any problems.

I remember waking up laying down on the floor, I screamed at my husband I couldn?t get up. And my husband got me up from the floor  when I fainted again in his Arms. He states I was unconscious for 10-15 seconds. After I wake up my headache and nauseous went always. I was fine the whole day.

Then about 3 hours after I received the vaccine I started having nausea and some hand tingling on and odd. The biggest limiting symptom was the excruciating shoulder pain on the left arm, no relief with ibuprofen, Tylenol, ice, changing position nothing. Worse pain I had in my life. I could not move my arm on its own at all and it was excruciating pain. Went to the ER and they gave me IV fluids and tramadol. The pain was better after that but I still could not move the arm and the pain was still present. They made me follow up with my PCP. I saw my PCP on a Tuesday after being on and off the phone with them on a Mondays.  Symptoms have improved but not back to normal.

I have not felt any major symptoms or side effects aside from pain at the injection site. This afternoon I noticed how sore my arm was and started looking up potential side effects of the vaccine to see how long I should expect pain. I was trying to practice lifting my sore arm and then started feeling light headed. My vision went blurry, my hearing was muffled, and I started to feel like I was going to faint and/or vomit. I tried drinking water to see if that would help and when it didn&#39;t I called over to my coworker to tell her I felt like I was going to pass out. She informed our boss, who called Employee Health. They both walked me downstairs to Employee Health.&#34;

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Dose 1  One hour after receiving injection- light headed, dizzy, trembling, hot flashes, extreme nausea, confusion, hard time speaking, skin numbness and tingling at injection site and on face/neck/arms. Took Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Acute symptoms dissipated after a couple hours. Continued to feel dizzy when standing/walking. Confusion/short term memory loss of entire afternoon evening (told by others- can?t remember actions, repeating myself and not remembering, can?t remember conversations). About two hours after injection, extreme muscle pain in left arm. Couldn?t lift or move arm and hurt even when not moving, took 440mg naproxen. Brought pain down to a more normal feeling of post shot soreness.

Heart rate was checked by medical professional in household and was found to be 120 and irregular. This lasted approximately 2 minutes. At this time also felt shortness of breath which lasted 30 minutes. Once the tachycardia and shortness of breath ended, I was getting chills and continued to have nausea and extreme fatigue. Since the vaccination my arm has continued to be very sore. When I woke up on 1/8/2021 I am still very fatigued and still have a sore arm.

Approximately 3.5hrs following the first dose of epinephrine / diphenhydramine, I had a rebound reaction and new dysphagia and went to the emergency department where I required another dose of epinephrine, IV famotadine, IV diphenhydramine, IV dexamethasone, and IV odanestron to bring the symptoms under control.   No local reaction at the injection site. Angioedema, urticaria, and dysphagia were all solely focused to the head, face, and mouth.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning her co-worker, a 28 year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced anaphylaxis reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Dec 2020, within five minutes of vaccine administration, the patient experienced anaphylaxis reaction. The patient had symptoms of throat tightness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and increased heart rate. Treatment for the event included an epinephrine pen  On 29 Dec 2020, the nurse reported that the patient was still having some of the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and weakness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, anaphylaxis reaction, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the event, anaphylaxis reaction, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred apparently 5 min after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# unknown) vaccine administration. She was treated with epinephrine pen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:40 am on January 8th, 2021. My arm was a little sore that night, but nothing too bad. I took some ibuprofen before I went to bed (400mg, I think). I felt fine the morning of January 9th; I went and bought some groceries and then took a walk in the neighborhood. I did get pretty chilled while walking since it was so cold. When I got back to my apartment around 2:00 I took a nap, then took a very hot shower trying to get warm again. Around 3:00 pm my arm started to become noticeably more sore so I took ibuprofen (600mg). Between 3:15 pm and 3:30 pm I suddenly started to feel warm and nauseous. I felt light-headed and while I was upright (standing or moving around) I would get some black spots in my vision. I went and lay down around 4:00 pm. I stayed in bed that whole evening with a fever (at its highest, 102), I was pretty nauseous, my arm hurt to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it and my wrist and hand felt very weak. I took some more ibuprofen (maybe another 600mg?) sometime after 8:00pm. The next day, Sunday January 10th, I mostly stayed in bed and ran a light fever (99.9) and was very fatigued. Arm was very sore and I had limited use of it until the latter part of the day. Monday, January 11th, I felt mostly fine, I could use my arm with no issue, but I stayed home from work due to the fatigue. By Tuesday I was fairly normal, just tired.

The patient&#39;s medical history included anxiety and allergy to latex. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 12-Jan-2021, 15 minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received one of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (026L20A) intramuscularly in an unknown injection site for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   12-Jan-2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced a severe allergic reaction which made her face puffy, red, and covered with hives.  She took 50 mg of diphenhydramine.  She was also having trouble pronouncing words because her tongue was swelling and she couldn&#39;t swallow water, so she used epinephrine  and go to the emergency room.  On 14 Jan 2021 she felt weak and tired.   On 13 Jan 2021follow up information was received and per source document/call -  In addition one day later, on 13Jan2021 around 5:30 pm, patient reported that she went to the bathroom and noticed that her &#34;face was still red&#34; and &#34;swollen&#34; and had a &#34;little bit of difficulty swallowing&#34; and took another unknown dose of Benadryl and felt better.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events,severe allergic reaction, difficulty swallowing, face was still red, swollen and felt weak and tired was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female with medical history of anxiety and allergy to latex who experienced serious medically significant unlisted event of severe allergic reaction described as her face puffy, red, covered with hives, tongue swelling and difficulty swallowing within 15 minutes after the first dose of the study medication administration (LOT:026L20A). Patient also experienced additional reported events of non-serious listed events of &#34;face was still red&#34; and &#34;feeling tired&#34; and non-serious unlisted events of &#34;face swollen&#34;, had a &#34;little bit of difficulty swallowing&#34;, and &#34;feeling weak&#34;. Patient was treated for the severe allergic reaction with initially Benadryl 50 mg and then with epinephrine pen and was sent to ER. Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the event of severe allergic reaction is possibly related to vaccine. Additional reported events of non-serious listed events of &#34;face was still red&#34; and &#34;feeling tired&#34; and non-serious unlisted events of &#34;face swollen&#34;, had a &#34;little bit of difficulty swallowing&#34; and &#34;feeling weak&#34; are possibly related to vaccine.

                                                Following the administration of the 1st dose I felt soreness on my arm. 2 hours later felt a sore throat, body aches, headache, fatigue set in.  No  skin reaction as of yet. The sore throat, body aches, and headaches resolved in 24 hrs.  The sore arm and fatigue persisted. 4 days after receiving the shot (1/4/21) I woke up to an itch on my right arm in the exact location where I received the vaccine. The itch persisted and grew over the following days. I also felt fatigue, soreness in my right side of my body and poor appetite throughout the week. The redness and swelling set in 1/7/21 a few days after first noticing the itch.  1/8/21 was the peak with the redness, swelling and itching being at its height. I spoke with my PCP on 1/8/21 who suggested I used an over the counter allergy medicine to treat the swelling. I took Claritin. The fatigue, soreness in my right side of my body and poor appetite continued until 1/10/21 when I began to feel more ok. The swelling, redness and itching is slowly resolving. Today 1/12 the area is not swollen, redness is very minimal and itching minimal as well.

I took Tylenol and Ibuprofen, and it took me 3 hours until I could have some relief and feel asleep. Chills fever and body aches I had for 3 days and it reached 100.7 on Christmas day. By Saturday no more fever but the pains were still there. Sunday I was fatigued and all those days I had pretty bad night sweats (about 5 nights). My nausea was so bad that one of the doctors I work with prescribed me some Phenergan that I took Christmas eve and day to help me be able to hold something in my stomach.

Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events on the day after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.  The events may be explained by an undiagnosed viral illness based on the constellation of symptoms and elevated monocyte count.

She started to feel better and left. Started to feel bad in the car on the way back to work. Her boss is a dentist and advised her to take Benadryl, which she did.  Traveling to Hospital now.  She has not yet been seen by a physician. Current symptoms are throat constriction, hard time swallowing, and having a hard time concentrating.  She is pale and feels unwell.   Wed Jan 13, 2021 16:09  Followed up with patient.  Patient is currently in the Emergency Room at Hospital. She has so far received steroids and benadryl.   Thurs Jan 14, 2021 08:56 Followed up with the patient again.  She returned home from the first ER visit at 17:30 last night.  About 4 hours after that her heart rate became elevated again (130-140 bpm while lying down) and she was confused, lethargic, and had a HA and backache. She went back to ER last night around 21:30. They gave her more benadryl in IV and toradol for the HA. She is now on PO benadryl every 4 hours for 4 days. Symptoms today include: runny nose, feels like a mild case of flu, HA and backache. Upon awaking this morning, prior to the morning dose of benadryl, her heart rate was a little elevated. She was also told she could alternate Tylenol or ibuprofen prn and use OTC cold remedies but hasn&#39;t needed any. The doctor said she is not a candidate for the next the second vaccine dose.

Increased heart rate of 120-150 continued for a couple of hours with minimal dizziness. About 5am, I had a bought of sudden explosive, watery stool. This continued 3 more times in the am, at times having incontinence. (This has never occurred before.) By 10 am, those symptoms had stopped. Only residual side effects were a headache and sore arm. On 12/31, it was noticed that I had hives on my abdomen and back. They were not itchy and I am unsure how long they had been there for; referred to allergy

Upon getting the vaccine approx 30 minutes after receiving i became very itcy, and my lips were burning/tingling. The itching continued to get worse, forming red rash on my chest. I called my MD at this point. I was told to take benadryl and to go to er if it became worse. I took benadryl. the itching continued for 2 days. i also experienced pain at injection site, headache, nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness. on 2nd day after vaccine i woke up and my muscles continued to be very sore. like i had just completed a marathon. I also have this sensation that started with the increased muscle pain. The only way i can explain it is that it feels like how a TENS unit feels, but its coming from the inside. especially in my back and thighs. this continues. i feel like i could just start shaking at any time. i cannot sleep but i am so tired. i was seen at dr today and i was told to report this to you guys. this sensation has not went away and has actually cause my muscles to spasming. MD said the vaccine effected my muscles and possibly neurologically as well.

Dizziness and severe nausea started and blood pressure decreased. Trouble concentrating and tingling in hands and feet. I was taken to the Emergency Room and hooked up to an IV and Heart Monitoring. I was given IV Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid, and Zofran. I was going to get an injection of Epinephrine but my heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly after the first batch of IV meds and they were concerned that the Epinephrine may have made things worse. I was monitored for 4 hours and then discharged with instructions to take Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for 5 days, Prednisone 60mg every day for 5 days, Pepcid 40mg twice a day for 5 days and given a prescription for an Epi-Pen. I remained very nauseous and dizzy foe the next 48 hours. My injection site became swollen, red, and tender 48 hours after my injection and then re-flared up 11 days after my injection on 01/17/21.

On Sunday 1/24/21-1/26 started with severe epigastric sharp upper abdominal pain, never had before. Was getting worse. Went to virtua ER on 1/26/21 evening, had ct scan with contrast showing fluid around galbladder and ultrasound showed wall thickening to 11mm, positive Murphy?s sign and fluid around galbladder. I was admitted overnight and surgeon had recommended removal due to ejection fraction of 12% from hida scan done on  1/27. Endoscopy was done also and was negative. Cholecysitis was the presumed diagnosis, with normal LFTS. I left and returned to ER where they did repeat ct scan showing distention , pain continued. Admitted for 1 night.  Pain was improving on Friday 1/29 , when I was discharged after repeated ultrasound showed resolved fluid. No history of any previous GI issues and no gallstones were noted on any imaging. I consume a healthy diet. Now having continued epigastric pain but improving.

                                                Around 5:30 PM I began experiencing normal symptoms like headache and muscle ache. At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

Migraine symptoms were relieved in 2 hours but still experienced some side effects of the medication such as dizziness. I got my 2nd dose of Moderna at 18:10, 2/17/21. I started to experience tingling sensation in my head at 23:00. The tingling was unilateral in the left parietal and left occipital areas. On 2/18/21, I experienced dizziness, fatigue, general weakness, bad headaches, and nausea. I took Acetaminophen 600mg at 22:00, and symptoms were gone on 2/19/20. But my migraines were more frequent since vaccination, but i did not take any medication for that. Today (2/22/21), some post vaccination symptoms are back, including headache, dizziness, fatigue.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in my left deltoid, my mouth felt prickly and tasted metallic, my lips and tongue turned red and slightly swollen, along with swelling in my throat. After about 30 minutes the oral sensations improved, but my throat tightness increased. With some difficulty I swallowed a 25 mg capsule of diphenhydramine. Fifteen minutes after ingesting the capsule, the esophageal swelling improved slightly. Over the next 18 hours I continued taking 50 mg diphenhydramine every 4-6 hours. On 12/31/20 I no longer experienced any oral/esophageal swelling or abnormal sensations. However on 12/31/20 I developed severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, lasting through 1/3/21. I felt well January 4-6. However, on the evening of 1/6/21 I again developed  severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, persisting until 1/9/21. On 1/8/21 I additionally experienced pruritis and erythema on my left deltoid, this resolved spontaneously on 1/10/21.

It started the day after I received my injection and I could not move my arm at all due to the pain.  For the last two weeks the red circle around the injection site has grown and the center is purple or bruised. Sometimes it is itchy but not unbearable. It is has not gone away and it has been 14 days since receiving the vaccine. I also have a headache almost daily and feeling nauseous. I do not have a fever or shortness of breath.

At 9 hours post vaccination, also developed nausea, muscle/joint aches, fever, chills, and severe headache. Tmax was 102 F, but averaged at 100 F for at least 24 hours (11 PM 1/20/21 - 11 PM 1/21/21); cannot gauge what occurred after 11 PM on 11/21/21 due to sleep. However, right arm nerve pain continues now on to day 3 (1/22/21) with also the development of small wart-like bumps on left ring finger. Tmax today is 99.8 F accompanied by mild chills, nausea and abdominal pain.

                                                Initially after the vaccine I felt fine, after some time I began to feel very tired, drowsy and had a headache. As time past I started to get cold and began to get the chills. At this time I started taking my temperature which was running about 99-100F.  The chills became worse and I felt colder and sicker. My temperature climbed to 102.1 at which time I took some tylenol. My fever continued to climb to 103.1 within the next hour. The chills and fever lasted about 6-8 hours and then went away and I became very hot. I went to sleep that night after taking more tylenol just in case. The next morning I had severe fatigue, mild nausea  and a headache that stayed with me the rest of the day. I ended up going home from work due to the nausea and migraine type headache as well as intermittent chills that would come and go. By the next day 1/22 I was feeling much better over all. However a mildly painful red spot that was warm to touch appeared on my arm where the injection site was that stayed for the next 48 hours before disappearing.

                                                Patient is 30 y female who was 11 weeks pregnant with a singleton gestation EDC 8/10/2021. She received the first dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/14/2021. Over the ensuing 4 days, she experienced fevers to 99.3 F, a bumpy red rash accompanied by itching at the shot site, nausea, headache, and fatigue. Tylenol 500 mg/dose was used for temperature control. She then had two days of minimal symptoms, but on 1/21 experienced sudden swelling of her left arm at the shot site with rapid expansion of the rash. The rash was itchy and the arm was painful. She had a significant headache, fatigue, and temperature to 99.3 F.  These symptoms worsened over the next two days, with temperatures reaching 100 degrees F, continued headache, fatigue, and increased arm swelling.  On 1/23/2021 the arm began to improve, but fevers to 99.3, fatigue and headaches continued.  The rash had expanded to almost 12 cm x 6 cm. Tylenol 500 mg dosing was used for symptom control with some improvement.  By 1/26/2021 the rash had mostly disappeared, the headache was gone, fevers were gone, and the fatigue remained. In all, symptoms lasted 12 days post-vaccination.

It hurt really bad - couldn&#39;t left it or move it. I took Tylenol once or twice that day with six hours in between. I was a little bit drowsy and headache and a little bit nauseous.  So I slept that day. I felt like my arm got hit by truck. 10th - I felt better that day. By Monday, the 11th, I was totally fine. Pregnancy: I&#39;m due May 29, 2021; I have had a miscarriage before so it&#39;s my second pregnancy. So far everything has been normal.

First 5 day (Tuesday-Sunday) symptoms: swollen, sore, red, &amp; bruised arm at injection spot; body aches, joint  pain of knees, fatigue, no energy, loss of appetite, dry mouth, headache, chills, nausea.  I felt better on the 6th day (Sunday), the injection site looked like it was healing and going back to normal on my shoulder. Then on 7th day (Monday) my injection spot started to itch and break out in a huge hive and little hives around it.  It turned into a bright red circle around the injection spot.

I had to take the day off work and slept most of the day.  I also had terrible muscular pain at the sight of the injection (L deltoid).  Tylenol helped with the arm pain. I had absolutely no side effects with the first dose.

                                                I exclusively nurse my 2 month old baby and on Wednesday morning my son began to have hematemesis and coffee ground stool. He had it the morning of 1/20 and then again he spit up Frank red blood early morning of 1/21 and darkening stools. He continued to have hematemesis sporadically until midnight 1/21 when he stopped eating and went NPO. We took him to the ER per our pediatrician?s advice around 1pm on 1/21 and stayed overnight to do an endoscopy in the morning. His CBC and PTT were normal and the endoscopy showed stomach ulcers had developed. Biopsies were taken and culture for H. Pylori sent . Biopsies showed no pathology and h.pylori did not grow on culture. Currently, I have no explanation  for his stomach ulcer development and I feel that the close proximity to my first vaccination should be further evaluated.

I was concerned since I&#39;m pregnant that it might have to do with the pregnancy. By 2:00 pain had progressively worsened and I didn&#39;t have much of a appetite that day. Around 3:30, I started developing intense nausea - and vomited 3:45 pretty violently. I contacted the OB - and she thought I should come in to be monitored. Hospital is where I went and I got there and they monitored to see how baby was doing; did a urine test - found protein and ketones in there. Drew labs - lipase was significantly elevated - 324. 156 were where my Triglycerides were at- a bit out of range. They dx&#39;d me with Pancreatitis - idopathic since they couldn&#39;t determine cause. They admitted me to Hospital from 9th - 16th. While I was in the hospital they did further lab work. I was showing malnourished - after a clear liquids only for two days. I asked to be discharged by 16th. On the 29th, the day I took the vaccine - I had a glucose tolerance test after the vaccine (about 08:30 AM is when I started the glucose monitoring test) - they diagnosed me with gestational diabetes with that two days after vaccine on December 31st. Expected due date - April 20, 2021; low PAP A hormone; 1st pregnancy

Chest felt tight, upper stomach in extreme discomfort,  Hard to see, lights hurting eyes, seeing spots in the air.  Sound became amplified and began to experience a migraine.  &#34;People talking low to me felt like they were screaming into my ear drums.&#34; Extreme fatigue so could barely keep eyes open.  Standing was difficult; moved to wheelchair. Most symptoms lasted 2 to 3 days.  Fever of 102 on first day only.  Fatigue for one week.  Right upper arm, not at the injection site, had a &#34;hive&#34; about the size of a nickel that has not gone away (as of 2/23/21).   New migraines with light sensitivity that affect ability to work also have not gone away (as of 2/23/21).

                                                Immediately after injection, arm felt some tingling that subsided. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

                                                10:47a went into a room to wait for 15 minutes directly after the injection. Began to feel somewhat dizzy right afterwards. Continued back to my office. Informed my supervisor that I was feeling dizzy but informed him that I had a couple bites of oatmeal, and a few cups of coffee and was going to try and eat something and hydrate and I?m sure I would feel better. I went back to work for about an hour (I work at a desk). For about an hour I continued to feel dizzy and noticed I was cloudy and was staring off. After an hour I really became dizzy and walked to my supervisors office and informed him. It felt as though I was walking on the moon to get to his office. I also felt like I had a uti. I sat down in his office and informed him of what happened. As I was talking to him I began to pass out. I did not go out the whole way but he began speaking to me more. After feeling a little better I walked back over to my office. I felt waves of dizziness and being hot and cold. My husband came and picked me up around 1:30p from work. I felt better after getting in the car and going home. Once I was home I ate and had began to feel better. Around 6:00p I began to go through another wave and was experiencing body aches, hot and cold sweats, loss of appetite, tingling all over my body but mostly in my legs and feet. At that point I went in and laid down in bed for the rest of the night. Probably around 9:00p I began to feel better. I attempted to fall asleep around 11:00p but when I closed my eyes I felt like they were racing back and forth. So I got back up and watched something in tv until I fell asleep maybe about 30 minutes later. I woke up the next morning around 8:45a. I tossed and turned most of the night, however I felt better. It was like I had the flu for a few days and on the last day I felt better but was under the weather. At this point in the morning I was fatigued. I was able to perform some tasks around the house.  I then laid back down in bed for a few hours because I was beginning to feel dizzy and was experiencing hot and cold sweats. After a few hours I got up from bed and performed a few more tasks around the house. Then was able to sit down on the couch and watch some tv. At this point I?m still expediting tingling in my body at times. Still a little dizzy but able to focus and hot and cold sweats.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

Slight shoulder pain right of the day, with a headache starting after 30 min. Later that night around 10-11pm i woke up with a splitting headache, chills, cold sweat and had a fever of 100.7. Took tylenol, woke up feeling better.  Mild headache lasted 3 days, when headache stopped heaviness/pain started in my left armpit - huge swollen lymph node (injection side). Was painful for 1.5 wks, this past week the lymph node is still swollen but not painful. I tried to go for a run 3 days after injection, I was short of breath and legs felt heavy (usually walk 2 miles daily with dogs, run 3-4 miles 3-4x/wk) figured that went along with swollen lymph node. Today is the first day I was able to run without difficulty catching my breath and my legs don&#39;t feel as heavy (2 miles, slow jog vs run).

Then rapid heart rate and chest tightness by 2.5hrs post vaccine. I went to urgent Care and they thought it was an allergic reaction (BP 182/90, HR 82) and gave me 125mg solumedrol and Benadryl intramuscularly which caused worsened dizziness and a racing heart which caused me to collapse and they gave me a epi pen and called 911. I was transferred to ER and they completed EKG which was normal and monitored vitals for a few hours and I was released. I continue to remain extremely dizzy and nauseated 2days after the vaccine.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine my tongue started to swell and almost felt hairy. My chest became tight, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I was light headed and dizzy. The next two days after I was extremely lethargic. I could bravely stay awake for more that 20 minutes at a time for the first two days. I was also extremely hungry but still had the metallic taste in my mouth. Until day 3 I would still feel like my tongue felt hairy when the benedryl would wear off.On day 3 I became nauseous and broke out in hives on my hands and neck. I did not fully feel like I had my energy back and was like ?myself? until 4 days after receiving the vaccine

I began to feel nauseous around 6-6:30 on the night of 1/21/21 (vaccine administered on 1/20/21). I then began vomiting until approximately 8:00 pm. The nausea persisted until some point in the night, but I fell asleep so I?m unsure when. Stomach pain persisted the same as the nausea.. woke up next morning feeling much better, but dehydrated. Still unsure if stomach pain is related, but positive the nausea and vomiting was from vaccine.

                                                At 6 hours from vaccination (day 0), very strong shoulder pain. Needed tylenol, have never needed tylenol after a shot in my life before.  Shoulder pain continued through to the day after vaccination (day 1) - had to take tylenol around the clock. By day 2 it was normal. On Day 0, around 8-10 hours post vaccination, I had rigors which lasted a few mins, chills, fevers, myalgias. Took tylenol. On day 1, about 17 hours from vaccination, I woke up with lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea. Felt like I was going to pass out. Laid down, and it passed. Continued with myalgias, fevers, chills, fatigue on day 1. By day 2, I felt normal. I took tylenol day 0 and day 1.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Returns to clinic at 0739. Had first dose of Moderna vaccine at 0715 today.  She states that immediately after her lips felt tingly.  She states that she was driving home and she began to feel tingling and numbness into her face around her mouth.  Patient denies having any allergies. Was walking her to the ED and she was talking to nurse, all of a sudden she leaned forward and was coughing and grabbing her throat. Rapid response team called, patient transferred to ED. She gets influenza thoughts without difficulty.  She denies any current URI symptoms no history of heart or lung problems high blood pressure or diabetes.  She denies numbness or tingling in her hands currently.  Currently very nauseated. Patient was given some BENADRYL and some Zofran was watched she still complained of some perioral numbness some labs were obtained potassium is minimally low at 3.5 calcium is also low at 8.1.  This time I suspect this is more of an adverse reaction to immunization shot however if the tingling or numbness persists then a recheck of her electrolytes may be warranted follow-up primary care physician.

Symptoms began on Wednesday 12/30/2020 and lasted until Saturday 01/02/2021 after I called my primary care physician who prescribed Imodium and Zofran to help with the Diarrhea and Nausea/Vomiting. Symptoms lessened and around Monday  010/04/2021 I was able to keep fluids down and felt better overall.

I did have some significant side effects including fever, headache, extremely painful left arm at injection site, hives that the injection site that lasted approximately 4 hours and were resolved with Benadryl and ibuprofen., nausea and significant fatigue.  The pain in the arm after injection was not at the injection site but several inches below the injection site.  On 01/13/21 I developed a raised, red, painful rash below the injection site on the left arm but at the site where the severe pain was.  This is also being investigated by Infectious Disease.

Took on empty stomach and felt nauseated and went and vomited. No other reactions other than fatigue and low appetite and sore arm the rest of the day. Ate less that day and so did get nausea off and on during the day - but not as severe and no more vomiting. 25th - everything resolved.  6/16/21 - estimated date of delivery. 1st pregnancy. Has been a normal pregnancy.

At 5:15 AM the following morning (1/14/21) I experienced lightheadedness and fainted off the toilet hitting my face on the wall/radiator in front of me.  My husband (who witnessed the fainting episode) stated I began convulsing and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head for 5-10 seconds. Upon regaining consciousness I was covered in sweat. After being assisted back to bed, I had nausea and headache with continued severe pain at injection site. I went to the ER around 6:45 AM since my severe headache, dizziness and nausea continued and to examine if I broke my nose in the fall. While in triage at the ER I experienced severe nausea and a second episode of fainting.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

                                                Patient had her first Moderna COVID vaccination at 4:00 PM today and 5 min later felt dizziness, worsening, associated with headache, nausea, sore throat, hot flashes, and dizziness is from side to side when she looks at her phone, no dizziness when she does not look at it. Patient primary complaint is headache on bilateral temples. All other symptoms resolved, and no dizziness if not looking at phone.  Patient has history of headaches, similar in quality, but this is more intense (6/10 intensity, less than her scoliosis pains, but more than usual headache pain), but otherwise the same, pounding sensation, and she can feel throbbing. Headache is about the same currently. Started simultaneously as dizziness, immediately, unchanged. No changes in vision. Peak intensity of headache around 30 min after onset, peak at 4:30 or so.  Patient notified the vaccine clinic staff and was instructed to be observed in another area, and did not improve. Patient remembered that her initial blood pressure was low and it fluctuated. Patient was then sent to the ED.  Upon initial assessment in the Emergency Department 2 hours after her initial injection, the assessment is likely vasovagal near syncope with tension headache, rather than true allergic reaction. Given metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, normal saline, and obtained labs.

Nausea and vomiting - nausea was on and off starting about 10 hours post vaccine. My body attempted to throw up twice but there was nothing in my body to bring up. The nausea and vomiting could have been from the intensity of the headache but I am unsure.  About 10.5 hours post vaccine I took 1000 mg Tylenol and then an hour after taking Tylenol, I tool 220 mg naproxen sodium. I was unable to fall asleep because the headache was so bad.   I woke up about 5 hours later and knew my fever had broken and the headache was mild. The headache continued on and off (most noticeable in the morning and at night) for about a week post vaccine.

However, light bleeding/spotting started that night/next day but thought still normal.  Heavier bleeding started 2/6/21 (Saturday) and continued through the weekend. Made appointment at hospital lab for Monday 2/8 to check HcG levels in blood.  See below for details, but Dr. suggested repeat blood work on 2/10 as Hcg levels showed positive pregnancy, but very low.  2/10 Hcg levels slightly lower, which confirmed early miscarriage occurring.

                                                I have a history of prior anaphylaxis in 2009 when I received (separate arms, same date and time) the 2009 seasonal flu vaccine and the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. Both were from multi-dose vials and providers I established care with following the reaction believed I likely had a reaction to a preservative. I?ve received single-dose flu vaccines with no issues since then. When I received the Moderna covid vaccine on 1/8/21 I had some right-sided throat swelling about 15 minutes after injection. It did not worsen and I was monitored for 1 hour after shot time. I went home and the feeling in my throat resolved after about 4-5 hours with no medication or intervention needed. I did not have any other symptoms until 3pm on 1/9/21. Started with mild abdominal pain, an hour and a half later I had chills, headache, fatigue and fever around 100.8F. No medication taken. The fever resolved within about 6-7 hours. On Sunday 1/10/21 the abdominal pain worsened and was a constant pain around umbilical region that felt as if it radiated outward, LLQ slightly worse. It was severe, directly affected normal daily functions. I could not walk, move, eat or drink room-temp water without pain increasing.  Walking 20ft at one point even caused me to crumble to the floor and cry, had to stay there for 5 minutes before even attempting to get back to the couch. No diarrhea, no vomiting, no fever, no nausea. I did have loss of appetite. The pain continued through the night and was constant. I could not find a comfortable position to lay in and tossed and turned most of the night. At 0430 on 1/11/21 I got up out of bed to pee, abdominal pain was so bad it kept me awake for about an hour after. Pain finally started to improve and I was able to sleep from 0530-0930. When I woke up on 1/11/21 around 0930 my abdominal pain was very mild and continued to improve as the day went on. Currently (1600 on 1/11/21) my abdomen feels about 90% better, I have no other symptoms. The symptoms, specifically the fever and abdominal pain, caused me to miss 2 days of work (Sunday 1/10/21 and Monday 1/11/21).

Patient was taken to the ED for observation, remained hypotensive (90&#39;s/50&#39;s) for about an hour, then slowly returned to normal BP (110&#39;s/80&#39;s) over another hour. Patient likely did not require going to the ED, however was taken there as a precaution due initially to the length of time passed out and hypotension.  Prior to this episode, the patient only experienced soreness at the injection site. Following this episode, the patient felt some weakness and had a mild headache for another 24 hours before returning to baseline.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

The morning sickness and fatigue continued for about 2 days after the vaccine. I started to feel better in my pregnancy and then after the vaccine and it all came back. It lasted 3 days and I took the Zofran and felt fine.

                                                December 29-31, 2020 Terrible headache, body aches, fatigue, diarrhea, sore right arm.  Jan 1-2, 2021 Headache, loose stool Jan 3, 2021 I woke up with a red, warm, itchy, rash at vaccine injection site on right arm. The rest was the size of a baseball. The rash was painful to the touch. Jan 4, 2021 The rash turned hard like cellulitis and was not as red. Still warm to the touch and itchy.  Jan 5-7, 2021 The right arm rash seemed to be improving, it was not as red and the hardness went away. There were little red dots in a ring where the circle of the rash had been.  Jan 8-10, 2021 I developed an itch over my entire body, it would not stop itching. My right arm starts to get the red itchy rash back when I workout or walk my dog, any time I get my heart rate up. I have to take Benadryl to help the itching go down.   Jan 11-12, 2021 My body is still itchy all over. When I exercise, my right arm gets red and itchy. My neck, throat, face, lips, and ears start to develop red hive-like blotches and they are itchy 20 minutes into my workout. This improves when I am done with my workout.  Jan 13-14, 2021 My face had a red rash over the nose and cheeks. This rash is sensitive to the touch. Jan 15 - Today Jan 16, 2021 The itch is very faint now. The red rash on my face is improving. Otherwise I feel normal.

The day after I received the vaccine I had a fluctuating fever of 101 F, body aches, fatigue, chills, nausea, and I vomited once. My arm was also very sore, but there was not swelling or redness at the site of injection. The side effects abated the next day, and I felt completely normal by Monday the 18th.

I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

At this time I took two Tylenol &amp; two Advil with a Ketorolac. The restless leg continued into full body aches, head to toe. Headache to migraine (this varied from on the top of my head to my left temple). These symptoms were consistent throughout the day, with severe fatigue. 1000 of 1/20/21 I was feeling chills and again nausea (again dry heaves). I drank ginger ale for the nausea, but I had no appetite till 1400. 1100 I took four more Tylenol. The aches subsided towards evening, however the headache in my left temple remained for the rest of the night. At 0500 on 1/21/21 I took more Tylenol and woke up later without the headache and body aches. However fatigue did linger with some back pain throughout the day. On the morning of 1/21/21 I did notice a lump and redness at injection site, as well as being painful to the touch.

My fever reduced to 99 degrees around 0730am and remained as such through the following day (1/28/21) as the chills, nausea, and cold sweats gradually faded away. I was deeply fatigued and unable to work.  Sometime mid afternoon I developed a crippling frontal headache That worsened in the light and standing. I have no history of headaches or migraines. I was still repulsed by the thought of eating. I took acetaminophen with a protein shake and it helped the headache And residual body aches enough for me to sleep. 1/29/21 I awoke still fatigued  with a minor headache.   I am a pro athlete with no underlying conditions. I have had my flu shot yearly with no side effects. I am extremely fit and eat a healthy balanced diet, maintain a healthy athletic weight, sleep 7-8 hours a night, do not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use recreational drugs. I was absolutely floored at how sick this shot made me.

                                                Almost immediately my arm was sore (as expected). However, about 7 hours after the shot I developed a fever (101), body aches, weakness, reduced O2 saturation (95-95), tightness in my chest,  fatigue, nausea, and headache. These symptoms were severe and persistent from 8pm 2/19 through overnight on 2/21. I treated it with Extra Strength Tylenol 1,000mg every 6 hours like clockwork, hydration and rest. I slept about 18-20 hours each day (Saturday and Sunday).   I awoke on 2/22 with only fatigue, sporadic tightness in my chest and O2 at 95 remaining. As of today 2/22 at 2:40pm the tightness in my chest has gone and my fatigue is gone. I do not know my O2 saturation right now as I left my reader at home.

These symptoms persisted into the next day, but had decreased in severity after about 24 hours. I still had a mild headache and body aches (specifically back, neck, and R shoulder pain) the next two days. Three days after, I started feeling worse. The headache again became moderately severe, as well as the neck and back pain,  fatigue and nausea.  This has continued through today (day 8 post-vaccine).  I still have a moderately severe constant headache (dull with throbbing with exertion or movement in neck), back and neck pain and stiffness, mild nausea, and fatigue.

                                                On Sunday, January 3rd, I woke up to find a rash about 3 inches long, starting at the vaccination site. By Tuesday it had widened. I have photos of both Sunday and Tuesday?s rash, if you would like me to forward those to you. Wednesday night the rash had lightened in color, it was mostly just the outline, but had grown larger than my hand. It crept up towards my shoulder, underarm, and about half way down to my elbow.   Thursday morning (yesterday) I called medical provider to make a Virtual Visit at 5:30pm same day. APRN, called me at about 12:20pm and told me to go to the ER right away. My throat felt swollen and constricted at the time, though I was able to breathe, drink and eat. Swallowing was a bit difficult.  I was seen by PA, at the ER at MC. She evaluated me and said the reaction was bad, but not severe, and on the mend. She prescribed oral prednisone 20mg for the next five days. I did not need any steroid or Benadryl shots. She also said she feels comfortable with me getting the second COVID-19 vaccination, which is scheduled for 1/25.

                                                on Wed 1/6/21 I had an allergic reaction and am unsure what set it off.  My eyes became itchy, watery and my corneas swelled.  I was sneezing and coughing.  I had a runny nose. on Sun 1/10/21 I had an allergic reaction; I think it was set off by a type of sunblock I&#39;ve never used before.  But I&#39;ve never had a reaction to any type of sunblock before. I went into anaphylactic shock: eyes swollen shut, flushed face, tight throat, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, severe abdominal cramping.  I had to go to the ER.

I understand that these were expected with the second dose. However at 9:40am I began vomiting. By 11am my throat started to close so I went to the ER. I had a minor asthma attack while I was there (coughing fit and slight wheezing). I was evaluated and they gave me IV fluids as well as other medications through the IV. I received solu-medrol, Benadryl, antacid, and anti-nausea. They took blood tests, urinalysis, and chest x-ray, all of which were normal. I did not have a rash around the injection site this time. I was discharged at about 3:10pm

Next day the pain has spread to my neck and ear. On day number three they felt numb, day number four lots of pain on my jaw. Day number 5 I couldn&#39;t even swallow and had difficulty breathing. When I looked in the mirror the left side of my face was very swollen like a ball and my face looked like it was paralyzed. I went to the ER where I was seen, but it remains the same days afterwards. My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

The events, flushing feeling, felt anxiety, blood pressure fluctuation, hives around injection site and contralateral arm and chest, diarrhea, shortness of breath, throat tightness and heart rate abnormal, were considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 34-year-old, female patient who experienced serious events of shortness of breath, throat tightness and heart rate increased and non-serious events of flushing feeling, felt anxiety, blood pressure fluctuation, hives around injection site and contralateral arm and chest and diarrhea. The events occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of mRNA 1273 (Lot # 026L20A, expiration date unknown). Treatment administered include diphenhydramine and epinephrine. Outcome is resolved. Based on the information provided, which indicates a strong temporal association of the reported events with the administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

                                                Roughly 4-5 minutes following my vaccination I felt a rush of lightheadedness, tension in my neck, difficulty obtaining a deep breath, flushed and sweating. My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine   I received the vaccine yesterday 1/11/21 at 1135.  About 2 hours later I started feeling symptoms :   Headache dull still.  I&#39;ve been having this pain/ache in my ribs and upper torso of it is crushing inward. My ribs feel like they are being squeezed too hard like a person hugging so tight that you are having difficultly breathing. And the upper torso under my ribs feels like when you have not ate anything in days of hunger pain (but I am not at all hungry) and it start to hurt soo bad that you can only hunch over and hope it goes away.   These issues have been on and off yesterday and today with the dull feel that has not gone away of a 3 or 4 to in a moments notice 8. Currently it is a 3 with a dull squeeze to ribs and barrable hunger pain (I am not hungry).

Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

The next two days I had mild symptoms (e.g., headache, nausea fatigue, bodyaches, chills). My arm pain at the injection sight last three days. Sometimes I feel tingling on my nose similar to when I?ve been wearing an N95 mask for prolonged period but no facial numbness after  the first day

                                                The day of my 2nd vaccination, I felt a heavy pressure being forced down on myself. It started as a weakness that begun in my left arm. I felt I had unequal strength and my arm felt numb. This begun minutes after my injection. Soon after the sensation went to my whole body. I had difficulty moving from the chair to a wheelchair. I was moved to a treatment bed and layer down in the supine position. I felt extremely weak and hot. After an hour I was released home. The evening of my injection, I started to become extremely tired. My appetite disappeared and all I wanted to do was go to bed. While sleeping I was awoken due to an heating issue inside the home.  I woke up, tried to eat something, but had no desire to. I went back to bed, after taking some Tylenol. My body was starting to ache. While in bed, I begun to experience severe muscle spasms, cramps, etc. These caused me to cry. I began experience extreme changes in temperature. I went from hot to cold quickly. My mouth became very dry, and the weakness persisted. I began to experience severe pain at the injection site that radiated down into my armpit and left breast and my left shoulder blade. I could barely lift my arm. It feels as though the muscle is very ridge, hard and I have point tenderness. I continued to experience severe fatigue and after waking up this morning around 10am or so, I felt extremely hot. My temperature is reading 100.1 Tympanic. I&#39;ve taken Motrin this time as I have been alternating between the two pain relievers.

Oxygen fine the whole time; heart rate regulated after the beginning and no fever - feeling a bit better within 1 hour. Headache started that night and lasted until midnight the next day. Very tired the whole next day until about 5:30pm.

                                                approximately 45- an hour after the injection I had some rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

When I got up the next morning at 6am, I realized I had mastitis on my right breast ( I got the vaccine in my left arm.) The mastitis consisted of redness around the areola, pain, swelling, and my lymph node in my right armpit felt slightly enlarged and painful. My fever was 100.9

My fever peaked at 101.2 at 2am. Pain relievers and fever reducers did not help. I had cold sweats throughout the night, not able to sleep consistently through the night due to body aches, headache and nausea. Left arm became swollen, hot and hard to the touch, this lasted through 2/17/21. The arm was itchy from 2/18-2/20/21. The fever and body aches lasted through 2/16 until about 10:15pm, around 11:00pm the headache went away. I was feeling mostly recovered with the exception of the arm by the morning of 2/17.

                                                I started having minor body aches about six hours post vaccine. I woke up that night nauseous and dizzy. I passed out on the way to the kitchen to get water. My husband somehow heard me and helped me back to the bedroom where I passed out again. I was eventually able to get back in bed without passing out, though I couldn&#39;t get warm and had severe body aches for most of the night. It was like having a very high fever, only there was no fever. I was clammy, but no fever. Around 4:30 a.m. the &#39;non-fever&#39; broke and the chills and body aches stopped. I was extremely fatigued for the next two days and felt myself again by the third. The arm in which I received the shot hurt pretty bad Friday too but that was the least of my concerns.   I did not seek medical treatment for these symptoms.

                                                A few hours after the vaccine my arm hurt. The next day (1/5/21) the body aches and nausea started. I wasn&#39;t worried because this is well known for side effects from the vaccine but I wasn&#39;t prepared for the heart palpitations and tachycardia I had for about 4 hours the night of 1/5/21. I had COVID in May 2020 and per my cardiologist probably had myocarditis that I am still taking a beta blocker for as a result of the COVID infection. There may or may not be a link between the immune response to the vaccine and my previous COVID complications. The morning of 1/6/21, I am pretty much back to normal.

                                                I am a healthcare provider. I had prophylactically premedicated with Tylenol prior to receiving my covid-19 vaccine. Immediately following the vaccine I had mild / moderate pain at injection site and muscle soreness at injection site. Roughly 20-24 hours after receiving  the vaccine, I developed moderate headache, fatigue, fogginess, full body aches, nausea and upset stomach. I continued on Tylenol twice daily. After a good night?s sleep, I felt better the following morning and all symptoms had resolved within 48 hours post vaccination.

                                                Upon vaccination, I had mild soreness in my right arm muscle on day 1 and day 2 (I have been reporting to the VSafe app). There were NO other symptoms or side effects including NO redness, lump/swelling, itching, etc.  I felt fine. I woke up Wednesday, January 6th at 8am  to some itching on my injection site. When lifting my shirt to look at it, I found a quarter sized, red swollen lump that was a little sore and hot to touch.  I contacted my hospital employee COVID phone hotline and spoke with a nurse who transferred me to a doctor (11am) I sent a photo and described my arm. Dr. stated that it was unlikely an allergic reaction due to it being 1 week later. She diagnosed me with cellulitis and started me on Bactrim antibiotic. I took my first dose at 8pm on 1/6 and at 2:30am I woke up with stomach cramps and diarrhea. I woke up again on 1/7 with an elevated temperature at 99 and feeling nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, slight body aches and a large, red hot touch spot on my left ankle (I had a spider bite on my left ankle in Sept 2020 that was treated with Bactrim it healed no issues but this flare up occurred same spot). I continued to take the Bactrim (3 pills total since receiving the rx) and still felt sick. I spoke again with a new COVID hotline doctor on the phone APRN CNP who stated she believes I in fact do not have cellutitis but rather an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine and therefore I should cease taking the Bactrim and start Benadryl. I did that at 7pm 1/7 went to bed woke up and my ankle was better as was my arm although you can still see the circle. I followed up on 1/8 with APRN CNP via secure messaging with photos and she stated again I likely am allergic and to monitor.

                                                When I received the shot the left arm itchy immediately yet the itching faded. The next early morning I had pain in the left arm as expected. I had a throbbing head ache and nausea through the morning I woke up at 5am and nausea was better by 8. I felt sore and tired that day.  January 1st there were no more symptoms. On January 8th I noticed hives around the injection spot and itching I had not noticed the itching since the day of the shot. I stopped wearing the band aid the morning after the shot, mentioning this in case the bandage could have caused hives.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Two days after my vaccine I noticed some pain in my low back and in my left hand and left foot. I also had one night where I woke up and had soaked through my blankets with sweat. Otherwise, felt fine. On January 7th I noticed that the injection site was suddenly very red and swollen and a dull ache had returned. On the 8th the redness was more filled in and less bright, still swollen and painful. I tried to go paddle boarding and all of my muscles were very weak and I got dizzy and nauseated. I felt like my body was full of lactic acid and that my muscles would not work properly. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and 50mg of Benadryl and got in bed and slept. On the 9th, the redness was almost gone, swelling still visible and muscles very weak, along with a strange tight feeling in my neck and head. My left toes went totally numb. I mainly stayed in bed and slept until the 12th when a precautionary COVID test was negative and I was able to get lab work drawn. I tried biking 2 blocks and felt that my muscles were a little stronger, however my joints felt very fragile and I was short of breath. On the 13th I got some tingling in my left foot and toes went completely numb on 2 occasions. Today, (14th) I do not have the lactic acid feel, however I am very tired and continue to have the head and neck tightness.

                                                there was bleeding at the injection site more than from a typical vaccination I have recieved in the past. I sat to wait and within five minutes was lightheaded, overheated but having chills and having intense abdominal cramps. My pulse ox and bpm were fine but my blood pressure was low for me; normal is 110/70 and emt&#39;s confirmed that I was 90/60 and then 98/62 after 40 minutes post vaccine.  I waited longer and then not feeling worse left. Advil fixed the cramps. So far it&#39;s only been pain at the injection site.

                                                Full anaphylactic shock; Hives; Low blood pressure; Dizziness; Stuffy nose; Bad headache; Nausea; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare facility staff member who was a 36-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine, and who developed full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose.  The patient&#39;s medical history included a latex allergy and pregnancy.  Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06-Jan-2021, approximately 30 minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT 01122019) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient received her Moderna vaccine on 06 Jan 2021 at noon.  She reported that approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she went into full anaphylactic shock.  She stated that the reaction began with nausea.  She then developed hives, got low blood pressure, and was dizzy.  She was taken to the hospital.  There, she received two rounds of epinephrine along with diphenhydramine and famotidine.  She was released that same day from the hospital once she stabilized.   On 07-Jan-2021, a full 24 hours after receiving her vaccine, she experienced another anaphylactic reaction.  She stated that the reaction happened exactly like it did on 06 Jan 2021 and presented with all the same symptoms.  Patient injected herself with the epinephrine pen that she had at home as soon as the symptoms started.     In addition to the anaphylactic reactions she experienced, patient reported that she had a bad headache since receiving the vaccine as well as a stuffy nose that comes and goes and coincides with hives.  As of 10 Jan 2021, she stated that the flare ups had finally subsided, however, she continued taking diphenhydramine and famotidine as prophylaxis for anaphylactic reaction.   Treatment for the event included epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and famotidine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events, full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose, was not provided.   The events, full anaphylactic shock and low blood pressure were considered resolved on 07 Jan 2021. The events, nausea, hives, and dizziness were considered recovered/resolved on 10 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the events, bad headache and stuffy nose, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 36-year-old female patient with medical history of latex allergy, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 01122019), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Anaphylactic shock, the non-serious listed events of Headache and Nausea, and the non-serious unlisted events of Urticaria, Hypotension, Dizziness, and Nasal congestion.  Based on the current available information and temporal associon between the use of the product and the onset of events starting on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                I felt a pain shoot through my arm to my hand as I was being given the shot, then my arm and shoulder were very sore. I was unable to tolerate sleeping on my left side that night and I had a bad headache. My arm is still sore now but I can tolerate pressure on it better. Yesterday around 1:00 pm, the day after the shot, I began having some itching along the back of my neck near my hair line. By around 7:00 that night my neck continued to itch, I was not scratching however, but also my upper posterior neck into my hair line became red, hot, swollen, and painful. It spread equally across my posterior cervical spine from the base of my head to about C7 level (pics taken). My headache worsened and pain spread all the way down my spine to my lumbosacral region. I still have these symptoms now but to a lesser degree. I feel nauseated today as well and had to stay home from work and contact my doctor because of these symptoms.

                                                Beginning the night of the 27th, I had a headache and a low-grade fever. I woke up in the middle of the night with a 102.7 fever, severe migraine, severe body aches, leg cramps, sore throat/swelling, and chills. I alternated taking ibuprofen and tylenol to try to control the pain, to no avail. I used bengay and cool washcloths for pain and to cool off. These did not help either. I made sure to keep drinking water and pedialyte. I took benadryl to try to sleep and help with my throat swelling up, it did not help.  All of this was non-stop until the morning of the 30th. That morning when I woke up my fever was going down and I no longer had the chills. I still had the severe headache, body pains, cramping, swollen/sore throat, and now diarrhea. Today is 2/1 and I am still experiencing severe body aches, severe headache, leg cramps, &#34;nerve pain&#34; type feeling in my arms, GI issues, and a sore/swollen throat.

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

Took some gas x to see if that helped. It did not. Pain got so bad that I went to er.  They thought it was my appendix,  how ever CT showed my appendix was good.

                                                About six hours after receiving the vaccine I felt fatigued. Two days after receiving the shot I began having symptoms in addition to extreme fatigue, including nausea, low fever, headache, and muscle aches. Now it is 11 full days after the vaccine and symptoms have not abated at all. The doctor ordered a Covid test and blood work. They also prescribed zofran and meclazine which have not helped. It has been difficult trying to advocate for myself without coming across as an anti-vaxxer or conspiracy theorist. I wish doctors would believe me when I say this is caused by the vaccine. I am not an anti-vaxxer and was enthusiastic about getting the vaccine, but now I am frightened by my body&#39;s reaction to it.

I also work up due to fever (temp 100.1 ), chills, and myalgia. I had a lot of trouble sleeping that night and got very little rest as unable to get comfortable. The next day I still had fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, joint pain, low back pain, fatigue and headache (felt similar to prior bad flu symptoms). I was sent home from work early as symptoms continued throughout the day with a little relief from a 500mg of acetaminophen. The following day 12/31 symptoms were gone except for the left sore arm which was improving and now completely done on 1/3.

I alternated Tylenol and Ibuprofen which took over an hour to have any impact on the fever.  I have used ice packs to also control my body temperature throughout the night.  I woke up with fever and have run fever all day 1/3/21.  It is 4:49 PM and it is currently 101.4 which is 20 minutes after my Tylenol has worn off.  I am also experiencing intestinal issues and started having diarrhea at 3:30 PM on 1/3/21.  I am very concerned about taking dose 2!

                                                About 34 hours after receiving the vaccine I started with severe stomach pain followed by vomiting every 20-40 min until 8:30 am; Following the vomiting I was still incredibly nauseous and still have intermittent stomach pain. I have NEVER had a vomiting episode like that ever in my life. I called my PCP at 8am and asked for a prescription for an anti-nausea medication which I have taken 5 doses of since receiving on 01/5/2021 at 12:00 PM. I&#39;d like to state that other then going to receive my vaccine I have not been around anyone to have gotten a stomach bug. My husband whom I live with did not start throwing up either so I don&#39;t think it was anything I could have passed to him. I don&#39;t know that this was caused by the vaccine however I did want to report it incase. I am having the 2nd dose on 2/1/2021.

I have also had severe chills, nausea, vomited twice, generalized weakness and shakiness.  It is currently 12:10pm on 1/8/21 and these symptoms continue.  Two of my other co-workers were at this same facility at the same time on 1/7 and have had very similar symptoms as well as severe headache which prevented them to work today.  We are all physical therapists, healthy young individuals, no co-comorbidities and were very surprised by these negative reactions and concerned.

The diagnosis of miscarriage was made at that time. A couple of days later, a repeat pregnancy test resulted in a negative reading.

Also very vivid dreams, headache and intermittent nausea, but no vomiting. R upper arm at injection site is very tender, but no redness or warmth.  Ibuprofen helped with the aches and chills.   Unsure of exact temp, as thermometer just reads ?low? (think the battery needs to be replaced).   Pt rested, increased fluids, and used anti-pyretics as needed to recover. Symptoms subsided after 24 hours.

                                                Reaction began to develop 8 days after getting vaccinated. The injection site turned red, was swollen and warm and has spread in size for a couple of days. I had a headache for a few days prior to my reaction on Wednesdays and my left underarm hurt. Additionally, swallowing after eating or drinking hurt for a couple of days. My body was weak and I felt feverish despite not having any fever. I am currently being treated by my physician as if I have Cellulitis and was prescribed antibiotics as well as instructed to take an antihistamine with the antibiotic. Today is my first day on the medication so I do not know the outcome yet.

This consisted of fever (102), chills, sweats, muscle aches, fatigue, tenderness at the injection site, and headache. The fever (reduced 100ish), muscle aches, tenderness at the injection site, sudden waves of heat flashes, and headache persisted into 1/23. I also had an onset of nausea that evening. On 1/24 I continued to experience a headache, tenderness at the injection site, and sudden waves of heat flashes. However, around 5 pm I noticed my arm (localized to below the injection site) was very red, inflamed, and radiating significant heat. It may have been that way since 1/22, but I didn&#39;t notice. Those same symptoms persisted into 1/25 and I contacted my PCP. I went in for a visit, it was assessed, with no infection noted, and recommendations to watch and belief it would subside. On 1/26 it continues to maintain some redness and radiates heat.

                                                Within 4.5 hours my arm was beginning to become sore. hour 5-6 I felt nauseous and foggy and body aches slowly started. I felt like I didn&#39;t get any rest that night, between the tossing and turning due to body aches and very sore arm. when I woke up I did take some Midol, it was all I had on me at that moment.  From there I still came to work, because I knew we wouldn&#39;t have the staff to cover our department . I had a cycle of symptoms. starting with the major body and joint pains, red injection site with heat. Then I started profusely sweating. Like I had just finished a 90 cardio session. That lasted about an hour-two. and then It started over. I had the same symptoms about 3-4 cycles worth. as soon as one would start to subside another one started. When I finally got home I took Some Excedrin and within 3 hours after that my body aches were very dull and my I could move my arm without throbbing pain anymore. I have now it the 48 hour mark. At hour 45 I started sweating again and my arm is still tender, but hours 4-34 were the worst. I just want to point out I Know the shot is injected high into the muscle, But my injection site was at the very top of my arm/shoulder.

Zaleplon insufficient duration so switched to Zolpidem PRN. She has not required more than a few doses of zolpidem but now we have uptitrated her to gabapentin 600mg nightly.

Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

Around 0700am I developed weakness, dizziness and nausea with the other symptoms throughout the rest of the day. Took Tylenol and rested but woke up feeling the same at 4pm. Took my temperature at 5pm which was 100.00. Attempted to call vaccine information line but they closed at 5pm and left voicemail message with VAERS.

Tuesday I woke up within 20mins I was nauseous and threw up multiple times. My body was achy and just felt &#34;blah&#34;. Was weak and dizzy when I stood up. I felt like my insides were on fire (like the worst temperature you&#39;ve ever had) but didn&#39;t have a fever. Felt like my brain was going to swell out of my head and it was the worst headache. I slept all day. Woke up long enough to call the dr and fell back asleep. Halfway through the day I ended up with a fever of 102 (it went down after a few hrs). Today I woke up still feeling weak and somewhat dizzy, spacey.

Lots of Sneezing over weekend on days 2-4; Monday 12/28- woke at 4a and was extremely dizzy and almost lost balance-went back to bed. Again at 5a and 10am but added vomiting along with any movement, could only lie flat on back, any movement of head caused reaction. No taste when vomiting, minimal smell; came back later in day. Advised to go to ER for Covid Test, since I had worked closely with someone else positive the previous week. Husband had to call an ambulance when I couldn?t make it out of the bedroom due to weakness, true vertigo-room was completely spinning and couldn?t keep my balance, and severe vomiting with any upright movement. Covid test negative. ER diagnosed as BPPvertigo because no other outright viral symptoms; only sneezing before; but they noted fluid in my left ear- said wasn?t infected. Told them of headache in back left rear of head, behind ear, and pressure behind left eye. Positive Dix-Hallpike;nystagmus. Vertigo continued, even with medication through Thursday 12/31/20 and turned to dizziness that subsided by Saturday 1/2/21. Weds 12/30/20- severe left ear pressure, feeling of fullness; focal pain/headache in bone behind left ear began, and pressure behind left eye increased. Low grade fever 1/2/21-1/4/21 (99.9). Seen by ENT on 1/4/21 due to continuing symptoms; and was misdiagnosed originally by ER- diagnosed by ENT as Acute Viral Labyrinthitis and Vestibular Neuritis. As of 1/6/2021- symptoms continue.   *suspected recovered from Covid March 2020

                                                I  got it at 2pm Friday.  About 2 hours later my arm started feeling sore but not too bad. I did some light yoga and walked on the treadmill for 40 minutes.  Otherwise took it easy that day. Satu I woke up with a slight headache which isn&#39;t unusual for me.  I still had mild soreness in my arm. I did a more difficult yoga workout and then walked 5 miles outside.  Took a shower after and relaxed for a bit. Then had dinner around 5 and within the hour started having diarrhea.  This lasted a few hours during which my arm started gradually hurting more, it was pretty bad. Could barely move it and hurt to the touch even. Shivering started soon after.  I never had a fever or fatigue during all of this. Highest temp was 98.4 with forehead thermometer. I talked to a doctor to put my mind at ease and he said I was having a big immune response to the vaccine, apparently younger adults between 20 to 40 are having bigger immune responses. The second dose is stronger so most are  having these symptoms after that one, but some are having it after the first as well. He also told me I should have taken it easy these past 2 days and that I likely overdid it. He advised that I take motrin or Tylenol, get under blankets to stay warm, and rest. That&#39;s exactly what I did and a little over an hour later I was feeling much better.   I&#39;m a bit freaked out by what the second dose is going to do to me since it is supposed to be worse. Is it safe for me to get second dose?

                                                I was given the Covid Vaccine in my left deltoid on a Saturday morning. I developed severe heartburn/indigestion that day but was unsure if symptoms were related to vaccine. My arm was sore for about 3 days after injection which was a common side effect. After that, my arm felt completely fine although I continued to experience severe heartburn. I made an appointment to see my PCP that following Thursday for the heartburn and he ordered a CT Angiogram to r/o thoracic aneurysm. During the imaging test the nurse injected contrast dye into an IV in my left AC, below the site of my Covid vaccine injection 5 days prior.  That night I began feeling pain in my arm and noticed that my lymph node in my left axilla had become swollen. I ignored the symptom, assuming that it was yet another symptom of the vaccine. 3 days later on Sunday evening (8 days after my initial covid vaccine injection), I noticed that my shoulder on and around the vaccine injection site  was  swollen, very warm to touch and was extremely tender and itchy. I immediately called my PCP. The next day (today), on Monday afternoon. A fine red rash has developed.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

I&#39;ve also have had muscle weakness and fatigue since a few days after the shot.

                                                On 12/28/2020 at 1930 I had a throbbing HA, nausea, chills, no appetite, body aches, extreme fatigue and low grade fever. Temp was 99.4-100.3. 1 gram of Tylenol was taken that evening, to relieve HA pain. Zofran 4 mg ODT was also taken for nausea. The following morning,  I felt extremely fatigued and had a persistent headache that was not consistently responsive to OTC meds. I developed a fever on 12/29/2020 in the evening. Low grade and ranging 99.3-100.6. Along with fever, my s/s were extreme fatigue, no appetite, headache, body aches, chills. On 12/30/2020, I spiked a Tmax of 101.0 around 11 am. Again, the same s/s were there. I went home from work early.  Same s/s and low grade fever persisted past 7 days, so I called my PCP as well as the Pharmacy where I received the vaccine. On the 10th day after vaccination, I notified my Infectious Disease Dr. He advised me to wait 6 months to 1 year to receive the second injection. He stated that my s/s were likely vaccine related and would go away with time. Fever persists through every day for the month of January 2021, with exact same symptoms. Started to notice Shortness of breath with activity, occasional sharp pain in chest. Presented to ER on 01/09/2021 with chest pain and shortness of breath. Labs revealed Acute Kidney Injury and Transaminitis. Cardiac work-up was performed, all tests negative. I was hypotensive. MD recommended I either get transferred to hospital, or stay in ER for min 23 hours observation for monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure. I received 2 L of Normal Saline. BP eventually began to rise with SBP above 90 and DBP above 40. (Normal BP range for me is 120/60-70&#39;s. Baseline Creatinine is 0.9. Discharged from ER per patient request, after second Creatinine level came down to 1.5. MD advised patient to not return to work for the next 2 business days. Spoke with PCP on 1/11/2021 in AM, and informed him of the events over the weekend. Also informed him that I am still febrile with same symptoms as reported previously. Was told I could not return to work until I was fever free. Was fever free for about 12 hours, until evening of 1/12/2021. MD not allow patient to RTW.

Over next 15 min started feeling nauseated, lips started to tingle, mouth and tongue felt heavy and I had to try harder to enunciate words. Went to ED and received prednisone. Tongue was a little swollen at this point. Airway was regularly checked and did not close.

The next day my right arm was sore lasting about 1.5 days. 2 days later I developed constipation for 4 days. All of that resolved. On Friday 1/15/21  I woke up with the injection site on my right arm hurting again. On Saturday 1/16/21 I noticed a 1 inch circular rash at the injection site that was hot,achy, and itching. This morning 1/18/21 I noticed that the circular rash has increased in size to 3 inch diameter, accompanied by aching, burning, and itching at the site along with dizziness, headache, and nausea.

Notified nursed overseeing the monitoring.  Nurses began hooking my up to monitoring equipment. Heart rate came down to 120.  Nurses noticed flushing in face and blotchiness on arms. After an additional 15 minutes of monitoring, flushing was still present as well as throat tingling (just tingling, no swelling), so nurses sent me to the ER for further monitoring.  Upon arrival to ER temperature was 100.2 F. (Temperature before vaccine was 97 F, no fevers recorded after ER visit).  In ER fluids and zofran were given and was released after two hours of monitoring.  In the evening I experienced moderate pain in the left arm (very painful to lift arm above shoulder level) that lasted about 24 hours.  I also had a mild to moderate headache that lasted about 24 hours, beginning the evening of the vaccine.   I also experienced mild to moderate nausea that began the day of the vaccine (Saturday, 12/26) and was on and off through Wednesday, 12/30.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

Little out of it feeling.  This was pretty much done by 1/1/21. 1/7/21 one week and a day after injection, injection site became raised, hard, inflamed looking  and was itchy. Site was visibly red and raised and had approximate 3 in diameter.  Previously mentioned symptoms began again (waves of hot flashes, nausea, aches).  This lasted at least until bedtime.  Next day, 1/8/21 felt better and injection site, though still hard and red, reduced down to size of quarter.  No further symptoms BUT injection site now as of 1/20/21 still looks like a quarter sized bruise.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

I waited 15 minutes in the lobby, felt fine, and left.  While I was still driving, about 7:45am, I noticed that it had become difficult to swallow.  My throat felt swollen.   I decided to stay close to the hospital, and ended up driving to Pharmacy and taking 50 mg benedryl and 400 mg ibuprofen at 8:00am.  I called my primary care provider and left a message, and decided to go to work (started at 9am). I took another 50 mg of benedryl at noon.  My provider called me early in the afternoon, and was unable to give me advice.  He recommended contacting Hospital (vaccine clinic).  I experienced chills in the afternoon, and after I left work at 3pm, I took another 400 mg of ibuprofen, a hot shower, and slept for 3 hours.  I felt much better after the nap.  I reported all of this to the CDC yesterday afternoon through their &#34;check-in&#34; feature.&#34;

My blood type is O positive if that matters

Around the same time I also experienced severe nausea, which lasted all night and I woke up with it today. I went to restroom to wash my hands and when I looked in the mirror I noticed 3 hives- 1 on my face under my left eye and 2 on my neck. My left eye was also itchy for about an hr or so.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  Premedicated with benadryl and phenergan prior to injection.  No pain at time of injection. 2.5 hours later, arm started to be sore at site, fever of 101.4, diarrhea x 1 episode. Went outside and fresh air helped, felt much better.  Fatigue and very mild body aches, arm soreness (no more than flu shot, less than tetanus) .  630pm: Acid reflux was the worst side effect I experienced. I asked a co-worker who received the same vaccine the day prior to me. She also had bad reflux. Even with a history of GERD, I do not need to take PPI&#39;s any longer and I needed to take an omeprazole the night of my vaccine, which helped some. Took tylenol 500mg and went to bed. Woke up today (the following day after vaccine feeling normal with arm soreness which got better throughout the day.  I would describe my symptoms as mild. The MD I work with said I should report these to Moderna just so they can track all symptoms that people are experiencing post vaccine.

                                                Client reported tightness when swallowing approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccination, but no shortness of breath or dizziness.  She felt flushing throughout her entire body as well as some tingling. At 7:05 pm, her oxygen saturation was 97% and her blood pressure was 115/80.  She also had red, irregular-shaped  spots on her right, upper arm  (non-vaccinated arm) and upper back.  At 7:13 pm her oxygen saturation was 98% and her heart rate was 111. She then described the tightness when swallowing from earlier as if the muscles in her throat were numbed, which made it hard to swallow, but not hard to breathe. The tightness improved slightly during the 30 minutes that she was observed, but it did not go away. She felt comfortable leaving and knew which signs to look for that would indicate that she needed to seek medical attention.

Sweaty and flushed, nauseated, felt like I was going to faint, then tachycardia and shortness of breath. Nurses told me this was a normal reaction, took my vital signs, and watched for everything to return back to normal, and told me I could report experience to VAERS. Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

                                                Within 30 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I started getting a tingling sensation in my lips and cheeks. It lasted approximately one hour. Felt tired the rest of the day. I awoke at around 2am the next morning with diarrhea, extreme chills and bodyaches, and a headache. My right arm was very sore, but I expected that. I went back to bed and awoke for work at 6am. My injection site was red, puffy, and heat to the touch. My body ached as if I had a bad case of the flu. The next morning, I awoke with nausea and vomiting. It lasted until around 9am.  The aches have eased up, but I remain very tired and my injection site is still very red, puffy, and warm to the touch. It feels as if there are knots under the skin.

                                                6 days after vaccination, I started to feel ill. Throat slightly scratching, almost like I was getting a cold. Then it went away. 7 days after vaccination, same thing, started to feel a little ill. Developed an itch at injection site. Nothing could be visually seen at the injection site. Within a few hours, half dollar sized round res spot appeared, with knot under it. Warm to the touch. Felt like a sunburn, with a knot under it. Day 8 after vaccination, woke up with double the size of circle at injection site. By end of day, pounding headache on left side, felt nauseous and unwell. Injection site itchy, warm to touch and began to grow in size. Went to urgent care. Once there, injection site was about the size of a baseball. Dr stated it was a reaction and prescribed an antibiotic and oral steroids. He noted how hard the knot was and was worried about cellulitis and infection. He told me to report this delayed reaction and advised me to not get a second dose. Since being there, about an hour ago, I feel worse. Ears are ringing loudly, increased headache, and almost a wet feeling at swollen injection site.

At 36 hours I had nausea and at 48 hours I had severe nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramping, chills. I felt improved Thursday but then felt similar again Thursday night. If I eat my stomach cramps and eventually have diarrhea. I had aching and stomach cramping yesterday still 10 days post vaccine. I?m unclear if this is vaccine related.

                                                I had previous anaphylaxis events that were treated and did not require hospitalization. I brought epinephrine pen and premedicated with Xyzal 5mg 9 hours before and Benadryl 25mg 1.5 hours before vaccine. 20 minutes after vaccine I felt flushing, nausea, low blood pressure. They had released me from the drive through vaccination site and I was driving and felt panicky, so I pulled over. I waited 10 minutes because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was anaphylaxis or not. I felt OK after 10 minutes, so I drove to nearest ER and waited in parking lot several hours then drove home. I probably should have administered epinephrine and called 911 when I had that reaction. Continued with 25mg Benadryl every 4 hours and nightly Xyzal 5mg. The next morning (24 hours later)  I woke up scratching my face. I had a diffuse sandpaper rash all over my head and neck and was very itchy. Doubled my dose of Benadryl to 50mg every 4 hours. Also took 400mg of quercetin. The itching resolved and the rash was gone the next day, which was 48 hours after vaccine. I was fatigued for several days but fatigue is my baseline as a narcoleptic plus I was taking benadryl. I continued the Benadryl for a total of 4 days. I normally do not develop rashes unless I rub against hay and I did not have any contact with hay.

By Wednesday she was complaining that she could not pee even though she was drinking a lot of fluids.  She continued to complain it was the worst she ever felt and then at 0600 Thursday morning she woke us up and said she needed to go to the hospital.  We arrived at the hospital just before 0700 and she immediately threw up in the trash can.  We went into a treatment room and they took blood and started fluids as she became incoherent.  She said she had taken Tylenol so they started a drug to counter that but her liver function was all wrong and they started to look for a hospital that could transplant a liver.  She was air evade about 0930 to Medical center and just over 30 hours latter she was dead.  There is a pending autopsy.  She was a healthy 39 year old mother who got the shots because she worked as a surgical tech and she was the single mother of a 9 year old little girl.
