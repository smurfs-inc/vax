He experienced arm soreness and fever up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit for 48 hours including chills, fatigue, and lethargy. Since that time he has experienced confusion, loss of mental acuity,, loss of appetite, confusion, loss of short and long term memory. His ability to provide for his needs on his own have greatly diminished. Prior to the second injection my dad was fully supportive of his own care and mentally sharp. He does seem to be recovering at times, is once again able to take care of his personal needs, but doesn?t eat and is still confused. He doesn?t want to leave his chair..

                                                Syncope; Shaking; Struggling to breathe; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 90-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included warfarin, ezetimibe, bupropion, finasteride, tamsulosin, furosemide, potassium chloride, rosuvastatin, and nitrofurantoin.    On 26 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot # 032L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.

Resident began to run a fever of  99.7, by 18:45 it was 100.3, and then he was administered tylenol and nausea medications since he was vomiting. He vomited both of these up and retemp check was done and it was up still, but then went up as high as 101.5. Tylenol was given again and this time he was able to keep it on his stomach. Fever was finally reduced and has not returned to that extreme. He was weak and a fall rick, so a sitter was placed in the room with him to keep him safe from falling. He would not wear his normal CPAP machine during sleep time. Feeling much better today.

Concerned that patient may not have received the full dose of the Moderna vaccine as it appears that the injection was given too low that muscle may have been missed. Tylenol every 4 hours as needed is also ordered for discomfort . Awaiting to hear back on guidance as to if another dose needs to be given.   Continuing to monitor at this time.

                                                My birthfather had an adverse reaction after he got his 1st Moderna COVID vaccine.  He lives alone and was doing well with some underlying conditions. The day of the shot was fine.  The next AM, he had vision changes and sudden numbness in his R arm/leg and fell after getting up.  ?The numbness went away pretty quickly, but the visual changes remained.  He refused to go to the ER/Dr.  The next week and a half, he was weak, tired, and couldn?t think as clearly.  ?He was brought to the ER? on Wed, 3/3/21 at Hospital.  He was found to have a low oxygen level, possible a-fib, fluid retention, emphysema, and aortic stenosis, in addition to his other health issues.  ?The Dr said his symptoms the day after the vaccine were a mini-stroke..  He was released from the hospital on Friday, 3/5/21.  On Saturday, Hospice came to see him, since nothing can be done for his medical conditions; however, they decided not to sign him up yet, since he I was told they didn&#39;t feel he needed to, at this time.  One of my sisters is staying with him during the day until he builds his strength back up.  Do you think his Mini stroke and health changes had anything to do with the vaccine? He will not be getting the second COVID shot.   ?We?re all caught between a rock and a hard place as far as what to do, esp for older folks.

After that his throat seemed to loosen up some and by later in the morning  the swelling had subsided. He did not inform me until I called later in that morning to check on them and he did not feel he needed to see a doctor.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included pulmonary fibrosis, sleep apnea, acid reflux and prostatitis. Concomitant medications reported included aciphex and ativan.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately two weeks prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, the patient experienced immediate flushing with red hot ears which persisted throughout the day and mild soreness at the injection site lasting approximately 24 to 48 hours. He experienced two instances of right-sided cramping neck pain accompanied by shoulder pain radiating to the head, lasting 5 to 10 minutes per episode between 20 Jan 2021 and 04 Feb2 021. These episodes were brief and have not returned and awaking to both legs and his back &#34;filled with pains&#34; on 23 Jan 2021. The leg pains subsided upon standing; back pain lasted all day 23 Jan2 021. The patient felt normal from 24 Jan 2021 until 04 Feb 2021.   On 04 Feb 2021, the patient&#39;s whole body became ice cold at approximately 3PM. By 3:15PM he was experiencing chills and shivering that lasted approximately one hour. Patient called his physician, and was directed to the Emergency Room (ER) immediately. There he received blood tests and prophylactic broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy immediately upon admission. Patient reports that Infectious Disease confirmed there were two strains of bacteria present in his bloodstream. From the patient additional samples were collected for culture to tailor antimicrobial therapy accordingly. He also said he was hospitalized for six days and discharged on 10 Feb 2021 with at home Iintravenous (IV) infusion device to administer continuous (24 hour) antibiotic therapy for a full 14 days. He was released from the hospital to his daughter&#39;s care.  He had no history of significant adverse events or allergic reactions post vaccine administration. He is concerned about the origin of the infection, as no source could be confirmed per Infectious Disease. The patient is concerned the infection could have stemmed from the vaccine or it&#39;s administration. He attests that his physician wants him to proceed with his second dose of Moderna.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events is unknown.   The events, flushing with red hot ears, mild soreness at the injection site, right-sided cramping neck pain accompanied by shoulder pain radiating to the head, leg pain, back pain, body became ice cold, chills and shivering were considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He had dropped his timer that was counting down his 15 min post dose wait time. Pharmacist approached patient and asked him how he was doing. He was initially non-responsive, eyes were slightly glazed over. I repeatedly asked him his name and how he was doing. He began to respond after prompting, saying he felt very hot and sweaty. He stated he was thirsty and he hadn&#39;t eaten anything before his dose. Technician obtained a glass of water and a granola bar for the patient. Patient began to improve just minutes after food and water. He stated he thought he had stood for too long while waiting for his shot and hadn&#39;t eaten that morning so he began to feel sick. Patient recovered enough to call his daughter to pick him up from the store. His daughter arrived to pick him up and patient was able to walk out of the store without issue.

                                                Hi, my name is, I&#39;m a RN and am submitting this report about my grandpa.  I took him into the VA to get his second covid vaccine on 2/17/21.   At that time my grandp lived semi-independently in a house between my parents and my uncle .  He didn&#39;t get out very much but with some help of grocery shopping and organizing his medication he was still able to live alone and function well independently.  My mother reported to me on 2/18/21 that my grandpa was confused, weak and tired.  My grandpa has never had any signs of dementia.  At this time he developed a delerium that waxed and waned.  He complained of headache, no appetite and extreme weakness.  On 2/23/21 he fell down in his house and we decided to move him into my uncles spare bedroom to keep better eyes on him.  The delerium persisted and on 3/5 he was taken to Hospital for a workup for his delerium and weakness.  There he saw Dr. an internal medicine doctor at hospital.  The workup showed an elevated BNP (probably baseline but I&#39;d have to look at previous lab results) but nothing further.  We opted not to do further imaging and instead take him home.  It became obvious to me that this was the end of his life and so I requested a hospice referral from Dr. My grandpa died on 3/24/21.

They should not have given him should not have given him the vaccine that is on hospice, it was not the right decision. I am worried about the elderly and those very sick.

The pt&#39;s COVID-19  screening questionnaire prior to receiving the vaccine was negative. The pt presented to the ED on 01/13/21 for weakness and m  PCR test on ultiple recent falls (since receiving his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine). The pt&#39;s COVID-19 01/13/20  was positive and he was admitted. He was started on treatment with remdesivir &#43; dexamethasone on 1/14. The pt initially required supplemental oxygen via low-flow NC, however his oxygen requirements increased to 100% NRB. On 01/16/21 his MPOA elected for hospice care.  The pt passed on 01/17/21. Unclear if the COVID-19 vaccine attributed to the patient&#39;s hospitalization and eventual death, or whether these events occurred from COVID-19 itself, however this case is being reported the FDA since this vaccine is under an emergency use authorization (EUA).

                                                march 13th -first covid vaccine (moderna)  march 3/25:  abdnormal movements noted Right arm followed by right leg...hospitalized from 3/25 to 3/29.  Neuroimaging negative for acute changes (records requested for review but not received by me yet)  Seen by me in telemedicine 4/1; he exhibited choreatheoid movements of right upper extremity and to a lesser extent, his right leg.  These seemed lower in amplitude than typical hemibalismus movements.  He was unable to control these movements (they were involuntary in my assessment) and followed commands with left side without problem.  Neurology consult was requested at the 4/1 visit but has not been completed as of today (4/15).  On follow up (4/15) patient and daughter inform me that these abnormal movments gradually decreased  and had grossly resolved as of april 9th 2021
