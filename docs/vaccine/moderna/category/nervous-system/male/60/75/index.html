Insomnia that night accompanying whole-body aches/pains/malaise.  Pain most notable in extremities. Nausea more significant at 12 hours (i.e. 6AM) but no vomiting. Significant lethargy all day 1/22/2021. Pain/nausea gone by 6PM but lethargy remained.  Slept most of the day. Symptoms gone by following morning (1/23/2021), so roughly 36 hours.   Overall these were symptoms consistent with a really bad case of the flu, minus the respiratory symptoms.  I often work through illnesses like the flu.  Couldn?t work through this.

                                                After second Moderna shot, Pt developed nausea, headache, extreme fatique, and bad back and leg cramps/spasms to the point where he couldn&#39;t walk.  These symptoms lasted for 48 hours and gradually subsided.  His wife (me) was so frightened that I will not be getting the Moderna series since it&#39;s so dangerous and will caution friends and family as well.

I remained in bed until about 4pm 2/5/21 &amp; soaked in a hot bath which relieved the joint pains.  Headache, nausea &amp; weakness continued 2/6/2021 &amp; 2/7/2021 with the headaches coming if any sudden movements such as coughing or standing up too fast &amp; nausea irritated by eating anything but saltine crackers.  Today is 2/7/2021, took sick days from work 2/5, 2/6 &amp; 2/7.

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.

                                                The patient was given his vaccine at 11:40am and a few minutes later 11:43am he said he was feeling very flushed and off. He said this extremities (hands and feet) felt hot and blotchy which is not normal for him (he does have neuropathy). He was sitting down for a couple minutes and I gave him water to drink just to calm down if it had been anxiety, but it did not seem to help. He started to complain of his heart pounding and beating rapidly. He said he was sweating and just felt very strange. I asked if he was short of breath at all which he denied. I immediately called 911 to have him be checked out and make sure he was ok since his symptoms had been going on for a few minutes, he was still complaining, and was not resolved with sitting or drinking a cold water. The patient did state that he had not eaten yet today (he does intermittent fasting and normally does not eat until 2pm), he did not take his blood pressure medication atenolol, and had driven about an hour here with his mother as she also got the vaccine today. While waiting for the ambulance I took his blood pressure which was very high 187/95mmHg which the patient confirmed is high for him. The ambulance arrived within 10 minutes and they checked him out. He did decline to go to the hospital after a thorough evaluation. The patient left once the paramedics cleared him at about 12:35pm so he was sitting and being monitored for a good 45 minutes before he left the store. The patient was never given any meds during this process and was cleared to go home by paramedics.

                                                Patient had vaccine and waited the 15 minute waiting period.  He felt well after 15 minutes and left the observation waiting area. He went up front to purchase something 5 minutes later and collapsed face first on the floor as observed by a nearby customer. The customer said he started having convulsing seizures and the customer went to aid in keeping the patient safe. the pharmacy manager (myself) was alerted and I immediately ran upfront to the patient with the emergency bag. 911 was already on the cashiers phone. They dispatched an ambulance. The only treatment was keeping the patient on his side and safe. He was having some labored breathing initially which quickly calmed down. The EMT arrived and they called his Dr office off the VAR. They said he had some hx of seizure. He had selected no to question #6 on VAR (Have you had  History of seizure for which you are on medication for). He became conscious before transport to the hospital. The EMT stated that he seemed to be covering  as expected from seizure.   He was then transported to Hospital Center.

Went to ER and was given EKG, Chest X-Ray, and blood tests to check for heart attack. Symptoms subsided after a bit. Labs were inconclusive. Sent home. Continued to have lingering aching in the heart region the next day. Throughout the weekend, continued to experience alternating sweats and chills, nausea and increased pain in hip joints causing difficulty to walk.  Stayed home from work on Monday, March 8, 2021 with the same symptoms continuing.  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 began experiencing excruciating thigh and knee pain to the point of barely being able to stand or walk. Returned to the ER where they administered Torodol and pain subsided. Will be seeing primary care physician Tuesday afternoon.

                                                I read today of &#34;covid arm,&#34; as described in an article about a symptom that may arise for those who got the Moderna vaccine. I simply wish to share my reaction for the sake of the statistics. The evening after I took the first shot of the vaccine I had a hard red bump on my arm near the injection site. My arm ached that night, and was notably better already in the morning, without aches the following day. The blister was gone the next day. I&#39;m relatively healthy, trail run and get strenuous exercise usually  twice a week.

                                                I received my 1st COVID vaccination at about 10:30am on Monday, March 8th, 2021. I engage in rigorous aerobic exercise regularly, including swimming. On the day of my 1st vaccination I did not exercise that day. About 24 hours later, late morning March 9th, I was at the pool for a workout that lasted about 90 minutes. Usually in the pool I may experience a bit of lower leg cramping, if any. But during this swim I experienced a considerable amount of lower leg cramping. After my March 9th swim I was not in the pool again until three days later on March 12th. During that swim I experienced absolutely NO leg cramps. I can?t say if the cramping 24 hours after my 1st vaccination was caused by it, or if it was simply coincidental.

Patient received vaccine at 1407. Around 5 minutes after administration the nurse was notified that patient was &#34;not ok&#34;. RN quickly assessed patient and called for help. At first assessment, patient was having involuntary movements and delayed verbal response to questions.  Shortly after he began labored breathing and became unresponsive. He continued having involuntary movements in bilateral upper extremities. He did not respond to sternal rub. At that time EMS was called. BP was 50/32 in right arm with HR of 52 and O2 saturation of 93% on room air.  EMS arrived to the clinic approximately 5-6 min after patient began having adverse reaction. EMS  took over care at that time. He was then transferred to ED by ambulance for further evaluation.

                                                On March 16th at roughly 1:30pm, the patient received his first dose of the COVID19 Moderna vaccine. Afterward, the patient experienced no adverse side effects. About 48 hours later, however, at 2pm on March 18th, the patient&#39;s spouse attempted to wake him from a nap. The patient seemed much groggier than normal and his expression appeared vacant. When pressed by his spouse, the patient could not say who he was, or who his wife was. He agreed to travel with his wife to the hospital. At the hospital, a healthcare professional asked the patient who he was. He answered with his correct name. He also correctly identified his spouse by name. But when asked where he was, the patient gave a long and incoherent response. After this initial screening, doctors at the hospital evaluated the patient for a stroke. They ruled this out as a possibility. Next, they suspected the patient&#39;s MS lesions may have contributed to his &#34;cognitive event.&#34; However, after comparing his 2018 scan to a current scan, they determined this was unlikely the cause. After about 24 hours at the hospital, a neurologist hypothesized that the patient had experienced a seizure. Another doctor at the facility concurred with this assessment. By late Friday (more than 24 hours after the episode), the patient had regained most of their cognitive functioning, though he still experienced mild confusion around the week&#39;s events (even preceding the &#34;cognitive event&#34;). Prior to now, the patient has never had a seizure before.

The patient&#39;s eyes were glazed, Almost immediately the patients eyes rolled back in his head. I shook his arm and shouted to him , he was unresponsive with agonal breaths.. I shouted for help from the other nurses. RNs came immediately. We moved him to the floor, called for an epinephrine injection to be prepared, I began to prepare the site for epinephrine injection to his thigh, nurse checked for pulse... at this time the patient was still unresponsive with agonal breaths... no pulse was felt so compressions were commenced by RN. Nurse gave approx. 15 compressions to the patients chest ,  the patient spontaneously  began to recover. Carotid and radial pulses were felt at this time. Breathing returned to normal. While this was occurring, we called a code blue and 911 was activated. By the time 911 responded the patient was fully conscious , alert and responsive. He could tell us his name and how he felt prior to this incident. The patient was transferred via a  stretcher by EMS 911 and RN accompanied him to the ER to give a report. The timeframe for being pulseless and having agonal breaths lasted no more than 30-40 seconds. Patient denied any history of a seizure disorder. No  epinephrine or IM Benadryl were administered at the incident site by the responding staff due to the spontaneous recovery.

                                                The day after vaccination, the patient started having numbness in the opposite arm as the shot. He did not report anything at that time because he didn&#39;t think it was a result of the vaccination since it was not in the arm that he got the vaccine. He just had a nerve conduction study done and there is nerve damage in that opposite arm where he once had a rotator cuff injury. The doctor told him that he thinks the vaccine aggravated his old injury somehow even though it was in the other arm. The doctor told the patient he has seen the vaccine even aggravate old leg injuries. The doctor said it will heal with time.

By the time I saw him on 3/23/21 the leg discomfort and foot drop had mostly resolved but was still present.  Denies trauma or any other sxs. [ Of note, he had is first COVID vaccine on 1/14/21 and 10 days later was admitted to medical center with hypoxia and DOE, dx with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID pneumonia and requiring HFNC, discharged after one week.]

The second Covid 19 Vaccine on 2/05/2021 went the same but after approximately two weeks I noticed soreness between my miidle and ring finger on my left hand along with soreness but thought nothing of it. the Pain eventually got worse. I went to my doctor on 3/25/2021 and was prescribed Naproxin and Voltaren Gel. The discomfort in my left had continues continues. There is selling above this area and the inside of my hand below those fingers hurts and my hand when I close it feels tight and this I atribute to the swelling. My doctor ran labs and all were negative even for Gout. There is a dense feeling in my left upper arm that comes and goes and some tingling. My left hand will have a burning feeling on the ring finger knuckle and experience pain when I fully open my hand. I have not injured my left hand in any way. I find it very unusual because I am right handed. I would appreciate any assistant if possible. I can send photographs if needed of my hand.

                                                The night after my first vaccine, I awoke at about 3:45AM with extreme aches and pains all over my body for about 4 hours, then I was okay.  Twelve days later, I tried to go for a short walk with my wife and the pain in my left leg was horrible at times.  The calf muscle was swollen and pink and very warm to the touch.  Also my toes were kind of purple and my ankles were badly swollen.  I thought the toes and ankles might be related to my Bradycardia, but the calf muscle sent us to the ER to be checked for a blood clot.  They did check the major arteries, as those are the dangerous ones, but did not check the calf as they said if one was there it wouldn&#39;t throw to the lungs or heart.  I was discharged.  The swelling went down in the calf.  Still some aches in the back of both legs now when I walk very far - but really not bad.  Having the purple toes and a possible blood clot... my daughter who is a nurse encouraged me to submit this information.  Thank you.

Symptoms of greatest concern: Nausea, Headache, Chills for 1-2 days; and the ongoing Fatigue is now in its 4th day.  Details of symptoms with time of onset, duration and severity are provided below (Note: Injection with 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine took place at 9:24AM on 07APR21):  07APR21, 10:30AM ? Arm Pain: Onset of mild pain in arm that was noticed when not touching the arm; Level of pain was a ?1? out of 10).  An annoying level of pain where the pain ramped up to 3 or 4 on a scale of 10 when the arm was moved about began at 7:00PM on 07APR21 and lasted 12 hours until 7:00AM on 08APR21.  The pain diminished to a mild ache for another 33 hours until it became insignificant by 4:00PM on 09APR21.  07APR21, 1:00PM ? Dry Eyes: Onset of an intermittent feeling of very dry eyes that lasted approximately 1-2 hours at a time and continued over a period of 9 hours until 10PM on 07APR21.  07APR21, 3:30PM - Fatigue: Onset of mild fatigue that steadily increased until bedtime at 10:00PM on 07APR21; and was significantly more pronounced at 1:00AM on 08APR21 (was difficult to stand and walk 20? to closet to obtain a thermometer; could not walk straight and bumped into hallway on left 4-5 times).  Fatigue was rather frightening and severe from 3:00AM to 3:30AM on 08APR21 when I crawled to the bathroom, but could not get off my knees and collapsed on the floor until I could return to bed by crawling on the floor.  Was able to stand again at 7:00AM on 08APR21 and walked (slowly) 30? to a sofa.  Slept from 10PM on 07APR21 to 1:00AM on 08APR21; 4:00-7:30AM on 08APR21; 8:30-10:30AM on 08APR21; 11:00AM to 3:00PM on 08APR21; 7:00PM on 08APR21 to 3:00AM on 09APR21; 3:30AM to 7:30AM on 09APR21; 9:30PM on 09APR21 to 9:15AM on 10APR21; 6:40PM on 10APR21 to 7:00AM on 11APR21.  Ongoing weariness continues as I write this at 11:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Nausea: Onset of continuous nausea that lasted 13 hours and 20 minutes until 08APR21, 8:30AM. Nausea was particularly bad with intermittent dry heaves for the 7.5 hours lasting from 1:00AM to 8:30AM on 08APR21; Nausea then came in waves for 23 more hours until 09Apr21, 7:30AM when it was finally gone.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Headache: Onset of headache that has lasted 4 days (as of 11APR21, 10:30AM). Finally gave in and took one extended release tablet of 650mg Acetaminophen tablet about 25 hours after the vaccination (i.e., took painkiller at 10:30AM on 08APR21).  Took two Ibuprofen at 9:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Chills: Onset of chills that increased to intermittent shivering by bedtime at 10PM on 07APR21. Awoke at 1:00AM on 08APR21 and could not get warm.  Two hours later, at 3:00AM, I felt completely opposite and could not feel cool.  These symptoms gradually subsided and were gone by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Joint Pain and Muscle Aches: Onset of joint pain and muscle aches that occasionally became annoying with twinges of pain. These symptoms subsided by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Dizziness: Onset of mild dizziness that lasted 12 hours until 7:15AM on 08APR21.  08APR21, 1:00AM ? Measured Fever: Decided to measure temperature due to significant chills and shivering and found temperature was 101.0 at 1:00AM on 08APR21.  At 3:00PM on 08APR21, my temperature was 100.2 (this was 4.5 hours after taking one extended release tablet of 650mg acetaminophen).  At 3:00AM on 09APR21, my temperature measured 98.6 degrees and has remained near there ever since.  09APR21, 4:00PM ? Arm Rash: First noticed presence of a rash measuring about 2? x 3? on upper arm near the area that received the injection.  Mild itchiness was present about an hour later and a topical 2% diphenhydramine gel was applied.  The rash had dissipated by 5PM on 10APR21.

Admitted 3/17/21 due to hypoxia, had ground glass opacities on CT. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x 2.  Vigorous immune response could have caused lung inflammation and hypoxia, similar to a covid infection, but from the vaccine. 60YM with a history of a chronic inflammatory arthritis on methotrexate, hospitalization in November 2020 with Covid pneumonia, he was discharged on 1 to 2 L of home oxygen, and reports that he was told by his PCP about a month after discharge that he was able to come off the oxygen as his oxygen saturations had normalized.  He returned to his usual state of health and activity with no issues until he received the first dose of his Moderna covid-19 vaccine through his primary care office on 3/13.  The next day he developed arm pain and then progressive body aches, headaches, fevers, chills, and shortness of breath.  He presented to the ER and was found to be febrile with hypoxia and admitted for treatment and evaluation.   Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with ground glass opacities on CT : oxygen 87% on RA in ER, 84% on room air 3/19, resolves with oxygen support of 2lpm.  CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x2 as well as respiratory virus panel, CT shows ground glass opacities, patient was started on ceftriaxone and doxycycline for empiric treatment for possible community-acquired pneumonia, although procalcitonin was negative.  BNP was elevated at 458, so an echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal EF, and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction.  Patient was given 2 doses of furosemide during the hospitalization and BNP normalized. Patient was started on prednisone to calm down a possible inflammatory response triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine in a person who likely already has antibodies, causing hypoxia.  With this patient significantly improved and at discharge is on room air at rest, but still requires 2 L/min with exertion.  CRP was markedly elevated, supporting an inflammatory process.  Autoimmune lung disease panel was sent and is in process at time of discharge.  Patient requested discharge home, Discharged on a slow prednisone taper to avoid rebound with abrupt discontinuation of steroids.  Patient will complete 2 additional days of Augmentin and doxycycline at discharge.

                                                Within an hour or two of the vaccine second dose every area where I have ever had joint problems gave me problems. The worst was the arthritis in my left thumb, which also suffers from Carpal tunnel. My thumb where I do have arthritis became so painful and sensitive to any movement that I could not use it. At one point the pain took me to my knees. I now think that the far above average pain in that joint that I have been having for  several weeks  may have been from the first dose but the extreme increase in pain right after the vaccine seems very likely to be the vaccine. I also had painful electric like jolts in my back and ankle and have been experiencing higher than normal chest, center of rib cage pain. All these areas are problem spots for me but for all of them to flare up at once right after the vaccine is unprecedented as was the pain in my left wrist/thumb.

                                                Because pt was uncomfortable he did not use his CPAP machine. 45 hours after second dose was administered my husband was sitting up in bed eating breakfast, He tilted his head back to swallow his his escitalopram and baby aspirin, sipped his coffee chewed and swallowed. He then went speechless and began staring off to his left. He lost consciousness. His chin stretched out to the left and his head rolled back as did his eyes. Eyelids remained open. His head and upper body began to tremble and seemed stiff though his hands remained down by his side. Time slows when in such an emotional situation but I think the complete event lasted about 35 real seconds.  I wonder if his temperature being elevated a couple of degrees and with his absolute lymphocytes on the rise if his strong immune response revealed a family predisposition to dystonia?

                                                On 4/3/21 about 2 weeks after my 1st dose of Moderna I noticed a raised rash/hives on my left middle back consistent with shingles I?ve had before.  Very itchy but painful to the touch.  While rash stayed localized the itchy sensation grew larger and wrapped around my left side to my left lower stomach.  Itchy, painful to touch and actually also numb.  Situation persists now almost 3 weeks later.  Situation is livable but uncomfortable. Virtual doctor consultation to monitor situation.

                                                Got the shot Thursday.   On Friday I had no energy, and was finding it hard to breath.   My upper chest became very congested  Saturday night I was very crackly in my chest and could not take a deep breath.     On Saturday it was so bad, I thought I had Pneumonia bad.  I called my doctor and they require a Covid test before I could get an X-ray.   Of course I live in Oregon where there are plenty of providers near by giving FREE RAPID COVID TESTS,  Every single damn one required a Doctor&#39;s consultation and APPROVAL before I could get the free test.    So I waited until Monday to take the test,  I got the results on Thursday.  By Monday all symptoms including my chest congestion.

The person at the check in table looked him up in database to verify date of first shot He wrote on sticky note and gave to patient. Patient proceeded to nurse to get vaccine. He told her he was there for 2nd Moderna Vaccine. Vaccine was given  and after that it was noticed that the name on the paper was not the same.  The person who was scribing brought it to my attention that  the date was too early for patient. When verifying the date I noticed that  it was documented that he had received a Pfizer Vaccine on 03/29/2021. I instructed hi that our records show that he received the Pfizer Vaccine on 03/29/2021. He still states he received the Moderna Vaccine. I instructed him to send me a picture of his card he states was at home.  He sent a picture on 03/18/2021 which showed he did receive the Pfizer vaccine on 03/29/2021 . He states his arm was sore. I followed up with him on 03/19/2021 and his arm was better. I instructed him that he did not  have to repeat either one of the vaccines at this time.

The pain would wake me up at night a couple of times- I would take extra strength tylenol and use a vibrator on it. Just before the 2nd shot I started to feel a little better. After the 2nd shot it made both my arms hurt but mostly my hands. I also had pain and difficulty raising and lowering my arms. Went to see my doctor; P.A. on 4/29/21 because my right hand was swollen. A blood panel was taken and results were good. Was prescribed Cadista-MethylPrednisolone 4mg.

Had decreased strength and sensitivity in extremities and Babinski&#39;s were upward going.  Discharged to home without medication and to F/U  with PCP in 4-6 days.  Saw PCP on 4/20/21. He had S&amp;G hyeresthesia, &#43; Rhomberg, failed tandem walk, and dysdiadochokinesia.  Neuropatic pain in shoulders, arms, legs, hands, and feet with weakness in hands and arms and sensory loss in left leg.  Was unable to get immediate MRI so patient was admitted directly to hospital.  MRI showed concern for transverse myelitis felt to be secondary to Covid 19 vaccine.  He will not get second dose.  Improved to near baseline with treatment of high dose steroids.  He also had an STEMI and was taken to the Cath lab where they found 50% blockage in a coronary artery.  They felt STEMI was caused by spasm.  Pt was discharged home on 4/26/21 and is having physical therapy to help regain his mobility.

                                                I haven?t had the chills like that in forever! It came in waves. You just lie there, hot, and ache all over, then this wave of chills hits for maybe 5 seconds then dissipates. The 2 mins later, it happens again! And this goes on for  an hour or more! I had to pee but was worried I?d be too cold to stand still. So I waited until I could not wait anymore. OMG! Trying to stand up! It?s as if my joints no longer worked! And when I did stand up I was dizzy as hell! The next day, utter exhaustion. I am so weak, it takes effort to move. Even breathing took work! I didn?t sleep all night as every position I lay in was uncomfortable and had twinges of chills. The amount of energy it takes to physically get up and walk to the bathroom is dumbfounding! This morning I am achy, hot and cold, exhausted, and just had a bout of dry heaves. I?m hoping to be able to get some sleep today.

                                                On or around April 15th I developed a pain in my left calf.  As a senior citizen and avid golfer I chalked this up to age and activity. But the  problem didn&#39;t go away and on some days would be more painful than others. Additionally, the point where my calf hurt seem to move around and sometimes be higher on my calf behind my knee.  Some days the pain was gone altogether only to return the later that same day or the next.   At the beginning of May I started to develop a cough.  I had no fever or other symptoms so I thought it might be seasonal allergies.   The cough continued to get worse so I made an appointment with my doctor on 5/26/21 and was seen that day. I was given a COVID test even though I had taken the vaccine and scheduled for an ultrasound on Friday 5/28/21. During the ultrasound they discovered a DVT in my left calf that extended from my ankle to behind my knee.  Since I was also coughing they scheduled me for a CT scan that same day. The CT scan showed multiple PE&#39;s in both lungs. They sent me to the hospital.

                                                I received the Moderna Shot in My R arm on Wednesday 4/28/21. My R arm stayed sore ( not at the injection site ) but up in the shoulder joint. It was stiff and sore with abduction or any rotational movements. On may 10th I noticed that the injection sit was showing signs of irritation. Ove the next 2-3 day lesions formed at the posterior aspect of the shoulder joint and in the crook of the R elbow. By the end of the week lesions began to form on the anterior forearm 2 inches below the elbow joint and 1/2 way down the anterior forearm. A small Lesion also formed 3 inches above the wrist on radial aspect of the forearm and another small lesion on the bas of the R hand just below the wrist.  I started on proteolytic enzymes, L lysine and an anti viral 3x a day and acupuncture. Now  on 5/27 the lesions are mostly gone and the pain in the shoulder is almost gone also

Had scheduled chemotherapy on 5/6 and 5/7. Swelling/pain returned. Saw doctor on 5/13 and both primary and oncologist via video conference determined it could be cellulitis. Was given Doxycycline and was to follow up with doctor on 5/17 but I had an emergency visit with nurse practitioner on 5/15 with swelling from fingers to middle of my left arm. Was sent to hospital, then transferred to secondary hospital to see hand specialist, in case surgery was needed. It was not. Until my release on 5/19, I was on round-the-clock antibiotics and given pain meds as needed. Currently still do not have full use of my left hand. Chemo scheduled for 6/3 and 6/4. Oncologist will make determination whether to move forward or postpone.

On 6/5 He awoke at 3:00 a.m.  in the setting of leg cramps.  He got out of bed to walk off the cramps, but then developed substernal chest pain.  He describes the pain as ?squeezing? and cramping with radiation towards the left shoulder.  He began to feel lightheaded and diaphoretic, and thus began driving himself to the ED.  On the way, he felt his symptoms were worsening so he called dispatch he recommended he pull over at a nearby gas station.  EMS met him there and transported him the rest of the way to the ED. In the outside ED, he was initially hypertensive to 175/99.

                                                He got his vaccine, had extreme pain in his right arm.  He went back to the pharmacy and let her know that it hurt for several days and then went away, and he is still having the tenderness in the arm.  It was so painful that he could not sleep on it due to the pain.   He then had no problems up until 5/24/21 when he noticed some swelling on his ankle of his right leg.  He put it in cold water to see if the swelling would go down and it did not.  Then he didn&#39;t think about it again until it was stiff, swollen and wanted to turn to the right side and hard for him to drive and taking his anti-inflammatories.  It progressively got worse and around 5/25/21 the swelling was severe and doubled in size and getting worse and on 6/3/21 he could not get his pants off due to the swelling and he went to the Dr. The next day.  He had pain behind the knee, ankle, pain in the leg.  He went to the doctor, and they sent him to the ER for an US which showed DVT of the right leg.  He was informed that it was large and that it was in the thigh of his right leg and not returning blood to his heart.  He was put on Eliquis 5 mg twice a day and is doing well for him.  The swelling is a little better, the ankle is still swollen, and the leg is still swollen, the top of his foot is really bad, front of his leg and thigh.  The knee does not seem to be swollen, but the thigh is.   He has no problem with the left side.  He is to follow up with his doctor on Thursday.  He is on Hydrocodone as well for the pain as needed for his neck pain and lower back.

It was extremely itchy.  I also got tingly fingers, which I still have as of today.  I made 3 trips to the walk-in clinic and got cortisone shots and cortisone pills 3 different times.   I also gained 15 pounds over that time period.  I also went to a allergist and he advised I was probably allergic to something in the shot.  He advised not to take the second shot.   All the other healthcare providers advised me not to take the second shot as well.   I have not had the second shot due to the symptoms I had.   With the &#34;tingly&#34; fingers there was also joint pain in the wrist and hands.

I had a moderate case of COVID in May 2020 and had positive IgG AB in August. The symptoms started with heavy shaking chills, lasting 1 1/2 hours , fever and most concerning sustained tachycardia with heart rate of 180&#39; to 200&#39; over hours, which then destabilized into runs of Vtach and complex ventricular dysrythmia, low BP, profound weaklness, head aches and joint and muscle pains ( similar to the experienced COVID symptoms )

At first it felt like congestion, but then started radiating into my shoulders, then into my arms and up into my neck. They called an ambulance. They gave me Benadryl and aspirin, which made me feel better.  They missed twice trying to blood, but said I refused, so they couldn&#39;t get blood results.  I don&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction.

My resting heart rate was at 100 for a few hours.  Normally, it&#39;s around 76.    I noticed on deep breaths, I felt the need to cough (no phlegm, just a dry cough.  One or two coughs per attempt).  No medical care sought.    Those symptoms dissipated and I felt good.  Then on January 20 and 21, the chills returned.  They lasted about 8-10 hours, then they were gone.  I also developed a headache during the 20 and 21 episodes.  I checked yes in the below adverse recovery box, but I am uncertain as to what tonight and the rest of the days have in store.

He also started to have muscle twitching and a visible tremor. He developed some subjective SOB, RR30.  Lung sounds clear. His BP was 179/80. He was given water and monitored for 45 minutes, at which point his RR was 16 and BP dropped to 160 systolic. Tremor cleared up. RLS symptoms resolved. He was sent home with education to go to ED with worsening symptoms.

                                                After Covid vaccination #1, patient was instructed to be monitored for 30 minutes due to history of sulfa allergy.  After about 5 minutes of observation, she approached me (pharmacist) saying she had tingling and a little numbness in right side of lower face.  She reported no difficulty breathing and no other symptoms.  I consulted the two other pharmacists I was with and we decided to not take any immediate action but continue monitoring.  I checked in with patient every few minutes to ask if symptoms were getting better/worse.  For first 30 minutes, pt said symptoms were the same.  After about 30 minutes, she said she had a little itching down her throat, but still no difficulty breathing.  We gave her 50 mg diphenhydramine and monitored for 30 more minutes.  After 1 full hour of observation, she never reported difficulty breathing.  She did get tired from the Benadryl and was up on moving around and said feeling slightly better.  After 1 hour, she went back to her room.

I too 2 500 mg acetaminophen two more times during the day. I was fatigued with some body aches throughout the day. The next day was very similar to the 2nd day after the shot but no fever.  It is now the 4th day after the shot and I feel back to normal.

He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

Took Tylenol  and slept throughout the day.  Got up around 12:30pm, felt better, did decide to go for a jog to get body temperature  up.  Jogged for 60 minutes, returned, ate and rested again.  4th day, felt much better, no dizzyness, still a little tired but maybe 85% energy level.  5th day back to normal.

Due to past history of allergic reactions, gave him diphenhydramine at 3:42pm. He felt okay for a short period of time and then started to have tightness in his chest.  He could still breathe fine, but called 911 due to past anaphylactic reactions.  While on the phone with 911 he stated feeling more tightness in his  and then decided to give epi-pen shot in left upper left thigh at 4:02pm.  The EMT showed up immediately after and took patients vitals.  EMT advised if wanted follow up monitoring could take him to ER. Patient wanted to go to ER for further monitoring.  We followed up with patient&#39;s wife and she said he was still not feeling very good and had follow up appointments with his cardiologist.  He also came in the store on 2-26-21 and all his test were normal, but still was not feeling like himself.

But  about Friday, my  right hand began to ache a bit. It became excruciating by Sunday.  My right elbow and my right ribs also hurt, but the joints in my right hand were on fire. I could not open, close, or flex it without severe joint pain. It was sore even to the touch especially at the joints.  The hand appeared to be a bit swollen as well. I took ibuprofen and it helped a bit. By Monday morning it was much better, but my hand still aches some.

                                                Ok I got my 2nd shot on Tuesday (03/02/2021) about 2:30 p.m. and was feeling great all evening. I woke up at 2:30 a.m. and thought I&#39;d been hit by a truck, my whole body was aching like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced. I also got chills and was shaking I thought I was on one of those machines that shake paint cans. I also had (and still do) a headache. The body aches subsided about 10:00 p.m. (03/03/2021). It is now about 5:00 p.m. on Thursday 03/04/2021 and I still have a slight headache and I am fatigued but starting to get some energy. On my left arm where I got my shot it is very warm, red, and about the size of a goose egg in the area I got the shot.

                                                1.  Shaking chills, fever and flu symptoms for one day followed by a day with malaise. 2. Daily diarrhea, watery stool, cramping and bleeding lasting one month.  Currently slowly resolving.  Treated with a variety of remedies over the month, individually and in combination.  ( Pepto bismol, charcoal capsules, imodium, rice, tumeric, and Xifaxin)  Imodium would stop the cramping but not the wateriness of the stool.  Unlike any diarrhea over the course of my life. I will not be taking any booster shots.

                                                After first shot in series, I developed slight headache, minor weakness, minor shoulder pain.    After second shot in series, 8 hours post-injection, I developed headache, moderate to severe joint pain throughout, fever around 100, extreme fatigue and weakness, slight difficulty breathing.  Went to bed for 19 hours and began to feel better with recovery in two days.  14 days post-injection, I developed a systemic rash throughout my body. Consulted with my PC physician. Was prescribed  Medrol Dose Pack.  This had very minor effect on rash.  Returned to physician for consult upon completion of steroid series.  I then received a steroid shot intramuscular in right hip and one week oral steroid protocol.  This achieved a more positive result, almost clearing up the rash.  I had a consult with a dermatologist on 03/02/2021 who confirmed the opinion that the rash was probably a side effect of the Moderna vaccine.  The rash has returned fully as of 3/14/2021.

The last three days I?ve felt better and really only feel more fatigued usually and have been going to bed earlier.

I didn&#39;t sleep for 4 nights and I had difficulty walking. On February 28th I went to Emergency Room and I was given a Toradol shot. On Monday, March 1st I went to my primary doctor and gave Prednisone, Gabapentin and Meloxicam tablets then I was given 9 days off from work. Up to the present, I&#39;m under physical therapy  and I still have on and off pain on my left leg.

I had symptoms of a Pulmonary embolism while cross country skiing March 18 and officially diagnosed with PE on March 22, 2021.  I was tested for Covid 19 on March 23, 2021 with negative results.  I had been reporting my side effects (which were none) for the previous 6 weeks following the second vaccination. I did have cramping like feeling in my right calf following a x-country ski weekend about 4 weeks prior  to the actual PE (2/22/21) but it appeared to resolve after about 7-10 days

These symptoms have continued for 3 months after vaccine.  Initially after vaccine became acutely ill with high fevers 102-104 f.  Also became severely weak with severe muscle aches and  severe headaches.  This lasted for 7 days with worst at the beginning.  Then I have had the memory loss and equilibrium and loss of ability to spell simples words that I had no issues with before.  I have had these symptoms for 3 months.  I thought it would all get better but it has not.  I thought I better let you know these problems.  I did not want to but because they have continued I thought I better tell you.

The lower back and thighs were sore for the entire week, and didn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine, but talked to some coworkers and they too had the same reaction and missed work.  These symptoms lasted until about 3/29/21, and had a miserable week all week lying on a heating pad/ice.  He could not sit for very long, couldn&#39;t be in the car for longer than 20 minutes.  He took Tylenol and Diclofenac for these symptoms.

                                                I was very sore in the back and shoulders the following day.  Also, my blood sugar dropped severely into the low 60&#39;s and I was shivering cold.  Two days later I started to develop a rash that worsened over the next several days.  I tried treating it with Benadryl spray and tablets but there was no relief.  A doctor prescribed Prednisone which also provided little to no relief.

                                                On April 1, 2 weeks after Dose 1, began experiencing upper R arm aching radiating from shoulder to elbow, similar to strain. However, no injury or muscle strain occurred.  In addition, began feeling tired in the afternoons, yawning continuously for a few hours.  Pain relieved with Aleve. Reoccurs daily.   Symptoms have continued.  Knowing my daily activity, these are not usual symptoms for me.  Of course there is nothing to link this to the vaccine, however, I feel it prudent to report.  When I initially received the shot, I had some aching at the shot site, but that went away after a few days.

As time went on he developed a slight headache, then his body felt warm.  When he went to bed he tried to sleep and he could not and turned from side to side, and still could not rest, very restless, insomnia.

The headache has subsided.  He has the soreness in the arm, but not like it was before.   All of his symptoms are subsiding.  He did not take anything for these symptoms.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Approx 10 hrs post-vacc, sore arm &amp; feeling that my body was &#34;fighting something&#34; (much as after other vaccs/inf post-BMT (shingrix, reclast). At 12 hrs post-vacc, feeling feverish, chills, body aches, trouble sleeping, temp=98.6, pulse=72 (unusual for me. Normal vitals: temp=97.2 to 97.5, pulse=55-62). Trouble sleeping throughout the first night, only 5 hrs sleep maximum. Next morning, at 23 hrs post-vacc, continued trouble sleeping, body aches, chills, sore arm, temp=99.7, pulse=90 (at complete rest, very unusual for me). FYI, i was well hydrated. At 27 hrs post-vacc all same symptoms plus headache, significant malaise, brain fog, remained in bed all day, temp=99.5, pulse=75. Fever.....Fever broke at aprox 35 hrs post-vacc, began to feel a bit better, temp=98.7, pulse=78.  At 38 hrs post-vacc (4/10 at 2:00am), i got up from bed to pee, feeling alot better &amp; vitals approaching normal, temp=97.8, pulse=58.  At 43 hrs post-vacc (4/10 @ 9am), feeling tired but otherwise recovered, vitals back to my normal ranges: temp=97.2, pulse=56.  FYI, after dose #1 of Moderna covid-19 vacc, i had sore arm, mild feeling that my body was &#34;fighting something,&#34; and trouble sleeping the first night, but NO fever and no other adverse symptoms.

Once the patient received a vaccine, he was instructed to wait for 15 minutes. Close to the 15 minute mark, patient described  his arm and face feeling &#34;hot and a bit heavy&#34; on the side he received the vaccine. Patient reported no swelling of the throat or face area. He had no trouble breathing. Patient did report he was experiencing some dry mouth. I assessed the patient for any rash, redness or hives around his face, arm and chest area. Patient was told to lie down on the floor and we elevated his legs. At this point, pt was still reporting no trouble breathing, but still felt hot around his arm, face, and chest area. An ice pack was placed around his face and neck which helped a bit. Patient kept describing a sensation of tightness and heaviness around his left arm and  fingers . We continued to observe the patient for another 30 minutes till paramedics arrived to take the patient to a nearby hospital.

                                                After my second shot after approximately 8 hours I got a severe headache perfuse sweating and vomiting, this went on continuously until Monday when I went to a family practitioner, she blew off my symptoms and sent me home where I continued to have these symptoms on and off. When on I was completely disabled. I filed a complaint they called on 4/15/2021, and told me I should go to ER, I told them I was flying the next day to see my mother who is passing away. I promised if my symptoms were still there in morning I would go to ER. I woke up feeling great and then I had a bowel movement my headache was so bad I thought I was having a stroke, I started sweating bullets and vomiting. it was so bad the only thing I can compare it to was when I had  Tick fever in the early 90&#39;s. I called 911 at hospital I was in a dangerous arrhythmia throwing PAC&#39;s and going in and out of 2nd third degree heart blocks. They can not figure out why, the neurologist I saw theory is the same I had, a severe inflammatory reaction to the 2nd moderna shot. He put me on a 3 day course of prednisone which helped a lot in my recovery. I am currently on a heart monitor to see if the heart block was just temporary. I see the neurologist again in 3 weeks.

He said he still feels discomfort in his arm but not enough to not want to receive the second dose. He said its not painful, he just feels a little discomfort sometimes when he touches the area or lays on it. I told him that if he still feels like this in a week after the second dose he should make an appointment with is doctor.

After the first dose I developed high fever, body aches and lethargy on the sixth day and it lasted several days.  On the second dose, it followed the same timeline, but on day 6 my lips and cheeks swelled and kept swelling for 7 hours even though I was admitted to the hospital emergency room within the first hour and they gave me 4 drugs by IV to counteract the swelling.  The doctors told me I was having an allergic reaction, but I had not eaten anything out of the ordinary and I&#39;ve never had an allergic reaction of any kind.  They were reluctant to admit that it was a Covid vaccine reaction, but they couldn&#39;t find any other answer and I knew it was... the timing was too coincidental.  Also, the drugs they gave did nothing and it took several days for my facial swelling to diminish.

                                                a 62 y/o M  who presents with concerns for an allergic reaction to the second dose of the Covid vaccine.  According to him he got the vaccine around 8:45 AM.  He has a history of anaphylactic type reactions with a swelling and urticaria in the past but has not had any symptoms in the last 5 years.  He felt sudden onset pit in his stomach, tingling and warm sensations over his face and some chest tightness.  He denies all the symptoms currently.  He did get medications prior to arrival but states his symptoms were already getting better before he been given anything.  He was given epinephrine as well as Benadryl beforehand.  He denies any symptoms currently.  Denies headache, change in vision, difficulty swallowing, lightheadedness or vertigo, chest pain, sore throat, wheezing, cough, nausea or vomiting, rash, falls or injuries.  Denies any recent foreign travel or sick contacts.  He did work a full shift yesterday and was coming off a 24-hour shift prior to getting his vaccination. He denies any significant reactions to the first vaccine.   Medical Decision Making  On initial presentation is an overall well-appearing 62-year-old male who has normal vital signs without fever or tachycardia.  He is presenting with concern for allergic reaction of the field to a recent vaccination.  The vaccine was given roughly 1 hour prior to arrival. He was given epinephrine intramuscularly as well as IV Benadryl.  He states he is currently feeling mildly tired from the Benadryl. He denies any other recurrent symptomatology and feels better.  Examination is not concerning for anaphylaxis at this time, no evidence of airway involvement or multisystem involvement.  No evidence of local allergic reaction.  Low clinical concern for occult infection, metabolic abnormality, ACS or arrhythmia for a cause of his symptoms.  He is overall very well-appearing.  Labs have been obtained as part of screening for reactions to the vaccination per CDC recommendations including a tryptase and C4 complement.  They were drawn over an hour after the vaccine was administered. ECG was within normal limits.  After observation patient remained asymptomatic.  Did offer steroids, however he wanted to hold off on them as he just got his vaccination which seems appropriate at this time.  He was sent home with a new EpiPen.  We also gave him follow-up in the allergy clinic.  He has any worsening symptoms we do recommend he use the EpiPen as well as call 911.  He is understanding.  At this point he stable for outpatient management.  I did tell him he should expect to feel aches and potentially have inflammatory response to the vaccine, he is understanding of this.  Pt was discharged home/self-care. Pt provided strict return precautions, including but not limited to, any worsening symptoms or any new concerning symptoms. Otherwise, Pt instructed to see PCP on an as needed basis.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA: I received my second dose of this vaccine about 9:45am on 2/24/2021.  About 7:00pm that same day I began to feel achy.  A few hours later I began running a low-grade fever.  The worst period of side effects was about 11:30pm - 1:30pm during which I had a fever of over 100,, with aches and frequent chills (pretty much every minute during those 2 hours I would shake with chills even though I felt extremely hot).  I was taking ibuprofen at the time (at 7pm and 11pm) yet did not experience any significant relief from the chills &amp; fever until about 1:30am.  I continued to feel achy the rest of the night with an off-and on low-grade fever (99-100), despite regular appropriate use of OTC NSAIDS (ibuprofen &amp; tylenol).   The fever went away by about 8:00am, and the overall achiness largely went away by 10:30am.  At no time did I require any other medical attention.

I needed to take Tylenol through the night which did help with headache.  The symptoms were significantly decreased by 6 pm that day (Feb 24th).

                                                I had the Covid virus early in November 2020 I had a bad reaction to my 1st Covid shot and wanted to ask if I should get the second one? I was able to get an appointment for a Covid vaccination thru store/pharmacy. I had the shot about 4:00 on Friday. On Saturday about noon I started not to feel right; head ache and stomach. About 4:00 I started to get an increase in my temperature. At 5:30 I started getting uncontrollable shaking. Over a span of about 30 minutes I had 4 or 5 episodes that lasted 30 - 45 seconds. I had a temperature at one point that reached 102.3 I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen every three hours before falling asleep for the night. On Sunday morning I still had a slight temperature (99.9), but it seemed like all my body joints ached. I ended up feeling better about 4:00 on Sunday. Reply

                                                The morning after the vaccine, the symptoms started with a stiff neck and headache on the left side including soreness at the injection site. As the symptoms progressed, I felt aching in my lungs on the backside, and flu-like symptoms with no fever, and spasms in my feet and stomach region. Other symptoms have been dizziness, facial puffiness and tingling, with continued aching and tingling in the left arm. The  stiff neck and headaches and general malaise has persisted throughout even until now.   As a school teacher, I have taken the appropriate precautions and received a Covid19 test: Results negative.

                                                On Friday (05.19.2021), fourteen days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (on 03.05.2021) at pharmacy, I began experiencing body aches (mostly leg cramps) followed by nausea, headache, and fatigue. They continued through  the next 36 hours. Today (Sunday, 03.21.2021) the headache subsided, but the nausea and fatigue remain, albeit less so than yesterday. I had similar symptoms in the first 24 hours of receiving the first dose but understand that to be a very common experience.

I don&#39;t recall the numbers however they stated I &#39;bottomed out&#39;.  shortly after gaining consciousness, I became nausea loosing contents of stomach twice.  Remained under observation for 30&#43; minutes, then wife drove me home.  Slept until 5:00 when I was steady enough to walk unaided, and finally eat some dinner.

I was unable to sleep due to the symptoms the first night.   I convalesced the entire next day and tired easily for the next two days after that.  Here&#39;s the unusual side affect:  I had uncontrollable and very painful leg cramps, that I could not relax. I had to take a muscle relaxer.  That was the night of the second vaccine.  The cramps were abated thereafter. I am reporting them because I saw them as a side effect no where online.

He finally ate something that evening, and started having left arm pain, aches and pains.  He was having chills, and then fell asleep again and woke up in sweats.  He also developed some diarrhea going into Sunday, and Sunday morning his temp went down, his blood oxygen went up and started feeling better.  He also still had some chills, and very little sweats than before.  On Monday he felt better, his blood oxygen was back to 100, temperature was better.  On Tuesday he felt much better and by yesterday 3/31/21 he felt back to normal again.  He did take some Tylenol and Ibuprofen for his symptoms during the course of the event.

                                                Pain in L hand and fingers woke me up from sleep at about 430am on 3/26. When making a fist, felt clicking on pinky. Felt and LOOKED like TENDON GLIDE ISSUE (based on my occupational therapy knowledge-base). Believe I did a ice message (I usually don&#39;t initiate warmth till after 1st 24 hours.) Did tendon glide exercises and later did a functional activity (washing dishes -squeezing the sponge). Resolved post about 1 hour without need for medications. Need to maximally avoid taking NSAIDs due to my chronic mild platelet issue. Do NOT recall any musculoskeletal issues on the L upper extremity.   3/26 not recall onset of symptoms - believe near noon - Significant Headache &amp;  Fatigue x several hours. Slept several hours. May be related to being awake in the middle of the night &amp; PMH of mTBI w/residual symptoms - .

The tingling is only on his left side which is the side of his body that received the shot.

Started seeing stars, vision narrowing.  I laid down on the floor, and it seemed like I was having a hard time breathing.  The pharmacist came out and started talking to me. My wife happened to be there and was trying to calm me down.  I felt like I was passing out.  The pharmacist checked my BP and it was like 80 something.  He felt I was having an allergic reaction so gave me a show with an Eppy pen.  They called paramedics.  I started feeling better but paramedics said I should still go to ER so ambulance took me to ER.  They ran blood tests, EKG, and chest Xray.  After a few hours they released me.  They basically said that it was ok for me to get second shot, but obviously I am now extremely concerned out about getting it

                                                After receiving the first Moderna vaccination in my Left arm, I started feeling pain in the area of the vaccination site on the evening of 03/22/21. As time progressed I started to realize I was losing all motion in my arm and weakness on my entire left side of my body, but assumed this was a side-effect of the vaccination .  I was not concerned until my wife alarmed me in the morning when she looked at me and noticed the left side of my face drooped and had that I had difficulty standing, no balance, little use of my left leg and no use of my left arm and hand.  At that point, 7:00am 03/23/21, my wife drove me to the ER.  I was admitted and an inpatient for 15 days including PT/OT/ST therapies at the hospital for Stroke.

Left arm was a little sore, but no other adverse effects of vaccination.   At approx. 01:00 on 4-9 I was awoken by what felt like severe chills with elevated heart rate.  I tried to walk around my house to see if that would ease the symptoms, it did not.  About 01:45 I started drinking a Brisk ice tea.  That helped &amp; allowed me to fall back asleep.  Felt sluggish all day 4-9 with flu-like body aches &amp; pains, so stayed in bed most of day.  On 4-10 I resumed my normal activity level.

                                                The day after my first shot I seemed to develop nerve damage in right foot.  I went 11 days in severe pain and half my foot was numb.  Doctor said nerve damage but no idea of cause.  It?s been over 3 weeks now and pain is minimal but 1/4 of foot is still numb.  Was going to get 2nd shot today and realized the pain started the day after I got my first shot.

Woke up at 10:00 PM with real bad chills and headache. Got up at 1:00 AM 4/12/21 very hot and chills. Took my temp and it was 103 degrees. Felt dizzy and weak. Took two Acetaminophen and went back to bed. Got up around 4:00 AM still hot. Took temp and it was 101.6. Took two more Acetaminophen and went back to bed. Continued this type of treatment all day. Drank water and rested. All day had temp, headache, fatigue, and nausea. Went to bed at 7:00 PM after taking 2 Tylenol PM&#39;s. Upon getting up (4/14/21), took my temp 99.5 degrees. Still have slight headache and fatigue, but feeling better.

I also developed hives on my  shin from knee to down to my ankle. I still have numbness in both thumbs and forefingers like they are asleep.

Headache off and on started Sunday 3/21/2021.  No medication taken for headache.  On Tuesday evening 3/23/2021, driving home from work had a sensation of something being wrong.  After arriving home at 7 pm had a short term memory loss.  Could not remember details of the day, for instance, or that he&#39;d already had the Moderna shot three days prior.  Was driven to the emergency room at about 9:30 pm.  Memory gradually improved over the hours following the spell.  They kept him in hospital until 3/25/2021, doing tests to rule out stroke, seizure, brain tumor etc.  All tests came back negative.  Was diagnosed with Transient Global Amnesia.

                                                I had a (first ever) stroke. I was attempting to take Flecainide for atrial fibrillation to reduce palpitations, the week prior and during the day of the stroke. I tried to take Flecainide twice before in the past few months, but I was unable to tolerate it. When I had the stroke, I didn&#39;t realize I was having one since I&#39;m in very good health. I emailed my electro-cardiologist about my symptoms that day and found it difficult to use the appropriate words and reading the email later, I could see a number of mistakes. My ability to comprehend spoken language that day was impaired. I could only keep a few sentences in my head at a time and my attention span was poor as well, like having significant ADHD, which I don&#39;t have. I was unable to retain simple amounts of information the day of the stroke. I didn&#39;t seek treatment on the day of the stroke since I felt it was more of the side effects I had been experiencing from Flecainide. After going to the hospital I felt good and much improved, cognitively. An ER neurologist said that my stroke was a 2 on a scale of 1 to 42. Over the remainder of March and until this day (April 16, 2021), I have made steady and rapid improvement. I attribute my recovery to the lower level of stroke damage and the fact that I worked out every day with physical exercise and I worked out cognitively by doing a series of activities that I chose myself: reading out loud, reciting poetry and tongue twisters, playing logic and puzzle games on the PC, returning to my writing tasks for work, practicing grammar, and speaking at length with family and friends as a way to practice speaking. I had one appointment with an occupational therapist and two appointments with a speech therapist and have completed assessment. I now feel I am nearly completely recovered with an odd sense of some improvement in certain areas such as heightened mood and quicker connections for noticing practical matters.

Chills stopped about midnight, headache persisted, temp dropped to 100.6. Did not sleep well. The next morning about 6 am, temp dropped to 99.9, headache persisted. Temp normal 24 hours after shot, headache went away, body aches subsided. Never took any pain medication, though I knew I could. I do take excedrin migraine about 5x per week normally. Was happy about side effects as it confirmed my immune system strong. Symptoms tolerable and subsided after about 24 hours. Spent most of day after shot in bed. Arm did not get that sore (Shingles shot 2 much worse). All side effects gone after 48 hours. Glad I resisted temptation to take pain meds though I know it would have been ok to take after shot. No side effects after Moderna shot 1, except for a sore arm.

Slumped in my chair grasping the sides holding on. Informed the person that gave injection that I might pass out, she said that I could sit there until I felt ready to go. Took deep yoga breaths while grasping on the chair hoping I would not pass out fall and crack my head. It slowly subsided. She kept saying I could go when I felt better. Really! I finally left after 30 minutes. Sat in my car with windows open for another half hour.  Felt better as the day went on, slept well and felt better the next day.

                                                Extensive DVT requiring surgery. Received second Moderna vaccine approximately one week prior to admission, presented with acute onset of left leg swelling and pain.  Left lower extremity ultrasound demonstrated an extensive deep venous thrombosis extending from the common femoral vein into the peritoneal and posterior tibial vein with a patent IVC.  He was given a treatment dose of enoxaparin and admitted to the hospitalist service.  Overnight he developed diminished sensation in his toes and vascular surgery was consulted.  On 3/31/2021 he underwent mechanical thrombectomy of the left superficial femoral and common femoral veins as well as stenting of the left common iliac vein stent.  Of note he was noted to have May Thurner physiology with compression of the left common iliac vein by the external iliac artery on the right.  Post procedurally the patient&#39;s swelling and edema was significantly improved.  He did not have any significant pain or difficulty ambulating.  On postoperative day #1 he was evaluated and found to be hemodynamically stable with improvement of his symptoms and stable for discharge home.  Prior to discharge it was discussed with the patient that he will need to be on a loading dose of Eliquis for 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg twice daily. No h/o COVID.

Within 48 he was confused and was unable to state his last name, which progressed to unresponsiveness by ~7 days after the vaccine. He has since become comatose and his brain MRI is notable for hyperintensity involving the deep gray nuclei as well as the periventricular and subcortical white matter diffusely, bilaterally. The etiology of his comatose state is still under investigation, but a detailed infectious, autoimmune, and malignancy work up at 2 different medical centers and have since been unrevealing as to alternate causes.

Severe fatigue and body aches. Ran a temp of 99.1 for about 12 hours. Took no reducers.  From the night of the shot to mid-day (48 hours later) I slept 30 hours. I woke up to use the restroom. I drank a lot of water. After 48  hours and all that sleep and water, I felt better. A little fatigue for a couple of days more.

No labs were done then.  He returned 3/19 with difficulty walking and talking, was sent to SNF after MRI with diagnosis (probably incorrect) of acute cerebral infarct.  He returned to the ED on 3/29 less alert, and no longer able to speak.  LP showed 10 WBC (mostly lymphs) and protein 70.  MRI was repeated, looked similar to previous scan , but reinterpreted as diffuse cerebritis, worst in basal ganglia.   By 4/02 he was deeply obtunded ... (cont. on next page)

                                                I woke up at 3:10 am feeling cold and chilling. I took by temperature and it was 98.4. I normally have a temperature of 97.1 - 97.7. I take it daily multiple times. My hands were cold. When I got up and started moving around I didn&#39;t have any more chills. When I got up at 6:30 am. I just didn&#39;t feel well in general. Slight feeling of sniffles, congestion.  I would get some aches that went away in a few seconds. They were at various points in my body, knee joints, muscles, and my head. They were simply a nuisance. I felt tired all day. My blood pressure was up 15-20 points on both numbers during the day. I&#39;ve told my doctor when my blood pressure is higher, I&#39;m having more aches and pains as though I&#39;m fighting a virus. I tolerated the symptoms most of the day, letting my immune system try to work it out. My symptoms seemed worse at 5:45 pm, so I took two ibuprofen. My temperature was 98.9 at that point. The highest it&#39;s been. All my symptoms got better until 1:15 am. I woke up feeling like I was chilling, but not as bad as yesterday, so I took two more ibuprofen. I feel 50% better today and haven&#39;t taken any ibuprofen. Here is the really strange part. I had these exact symptoms and similar temperature ranges twic last year. In July and October I think. I didn&#39;t get tested last year because they were minor symptoms. They were just nuisance symptoms. I took ibuprofen right away last year.  I followed the masking guidelines, social distancing, etc. So, is it just coincidence I had similar symptoms last year two times, that I had when I getting the inactive Moderna vaccine? I had no reaction to the first shot.  I just wanted to provide the information in case it is helpful. Very strange. I expect no other symptoms in a couple of days.

                                                1) After midnight, I began to get what felt like the shivers, but they were unlike anything I had ever seen or experienced, as I could not stop shaking, feeling like I had to try to get warm.  I had a heat pack under my back, and no temperature, but for 25 minutes, kept shaking. 2) At 10am in the morning, I began hallucinating, which has never happened to me before, and I only recognize because when my Dad was dying of prostate cancer, they had him on morphine and he began to see things.  It was a very specific hallucination, of being in a specific from in front of a specific computer talking to a person.  I feel quite reluctant to share this.  This lasted for somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes. 3) I&#39;ve vomited once, and had diarrhea, drinking lots of water, and only using Tylenol.  I did not take the Tylenol until after I stopped shivering.

Asked wife to get pulse oximeter- sat/pulse ranging 93-97, depending on finger, hand, how long on each; noted amplitude lower than my normal; 82-86 range pulse. 9:53pm Obtained BP R wrist supine 105/61 Pulse 82. Felt too dizzy for BP to be done in sitting. BP confirmed by second reading. BP wrist supine sys about 30 -35 &amp; diastolic about 10-20 below baseline. 9:56pm Took 1000mg Acetaminophen. 11pm Temp less than 99, marked decrease head to toe pain, more towards my mild lightheadedness at times due to my mild TB baseline. Able to ambulate. 4/23/21 4-5 am Temp low 98 range (more my normal). 7am BP L wrist supine 135/70 Pulse 69. Sat 98 reading obtained very quickly, pulse amplitude more my normal. Feeling better but not to Pre-vax. Repeated BP &amp; Sat readings twice during the rest of date. Don?t recall time of 1st BP 135/70 Pulse 70 &amp; Sat 96/Pulse 69, noted injection site redness. 9:30pm- started having headaches, pain on L side head (near site of my head wound/mild TBI site), slight increase lightheadedness, injection site red area increased in pain &amp; size to covering almost full deltoid area. BP 125/73 Pulse 65 Sat 97/ Pulse 65. Both Sat numbers obtained very quickly, as per my normal. Ice used. Alleviated pain to tolerable. Monitoring size of red area &amp; intensity/duration of lightheadedness. Recall a strong tingling sensation going down my left arm once. Noted change in sensation afterwards. Slight increase lightheadedness felt due to what usually happens in change in weather, like rain coming. Rain occurred. 4/25/21- Basically the peripheral of deltoid showing redness with some scattered redness centrally. At 8pm redness fully covering deltoid area. Will continue to monitor (&#34;Covid arm&#34;). Other than fatigue thought due to vax, NO S/S of markedly reduce platelets. If need be, will contact Teledoc.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Pain, Rash, Panic attack (2 episodes) and Anxiety. Previously administered products included for an unreported indication: PREDNISONE (for 6 days). Concomitant products included PREDNISONE for Pain and Rash, METHYLPREDNISOLONE (MEDROL DOSEPAK) for an unknown indication.    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia rheumatica) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PAIN (Pain became more consistent), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain/pain is in his arm), ARTHRALGIA (Pain in shoulders), HYPOKINESIA (Could not lift arm), ARTHRALGIA (Left hip hurt), INFLAMMATION (Inflammatory reaction), TREMOR (Shaking), GAIT DISTURBANCE (he could not get out of bed, was shaking, and used a cane to walk), ARTHRALGIA (Joint pain) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in legs got worse). At the time of the report, POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia rheumatica), PAIN (Pain became more consistent), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain/pain is in his arm), ARTHRALGIA (Pain in shoulders), ARTHRALGIA (Left hip hurt), ARTHRALGIA (Joint pain) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in legs got worse) had not resolved and HYPOKINESIA (Could not lift arm), INFLAMMATION (Inflammatory reaction), TREMOR (Shaking) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (he could not get out of bed, was shaking, and used a cane to walk) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Since the patient&#39;s first dose of the Moderna vaccine, he had not been on prednisone the whole time but was recently put on a Medrol pack. He was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica as his pain became more consistent after the first dose of the vaccine. His pain is in his arm and shoulders, his left hip hurt and he was not able to lift his arm all the way up.  The patient believed that the vaccine may had caused an inflammatory reaction that aggravated his pain that was present before the vaccine. The patient also stated there was a time that he was not able to get out of bed, he was shaking, and had to use a cane to walk. He says he never had joint pain, only stiffness when waking up and soreness in his hip and leg that was painful. After the vaccine, his arm hurt to the extent he could not sleep on it and the pain in his legs had worsened. He makes it very clear he had a lot of pain prior to the vaccine, but the pain he was experiencing now is more consistent.

                                                Patient admitted with left sided weakness on 4/21/21. First covid-19 vaccine (Moderna) received on 3/23/21. MRI/MRA shows acute infarcts of the right caudate body and striatum. H/o HTN, hep C with cirrhosis, COPD, tobacco abuse, alcohol use disorder, GTC seizure disorder. ECHO on 4/21/21 which was normal. Patient thought to be actively overusing alcohol at home. Patient was treated for stroke and discharged on medications to help with alcohol withdrawal symptoms (clonidine, gabapentin) as well as aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin for new stroke. Thrombocytopenia noted (platelets 50K), however patient?s platelets have historically been low likely related to alcohol use. Per hospitalist discharge summary, low suspicion for vaccine induced thrombocytopenia. HIT Ab test ordered on 4/21/21, resulted negative. It seems to be coincidental that stroke occurred about a month after patient?s first covid-19 vaccine but reported to VAERS for completeness. Did not add covid-19 vaccine to patient?s allergy list. Patient received second covid-19 vaccine (Moderna) on 4/28/21.

                                                On Friday, April 9, 2021 PT received the second Covid shot.  The shot was administered in the right arm. About 6:00 pm  on that same day significant pain started, affecting his right arm, elbow, shoulder , and chest.   By Monday 4/12/2021 the pain was so severe he went to  a local clinic  to get checked.  He was  prescribed Naproxen for pain.  He was still in so much pain on Tuesday 4/13 /2021 he went to the ER .  They took him immediately back to check for possible heart attack and blood clot.  After a stay of 6 hours  the tests came back that there was no heart attack  or a blood clot.  He was prescribed more pain medication.  Still not getting any relief from pain and now PT&#39;s fingers are going numb, PT went to See Dr.   on 4/15/2021. Dr.  determined that the shot had somehow effected  the nerve endings.  He gave him a dose pack of steroids by pill.   He told him to check back if not better in a while.   The week of April 19 the pain eased up through the day to around a level  3,  to only return at night to a level 10, resulting in more loss of sleep.   PT went back to Dr.  on Friday, 4/23/2021 and received a steroid shot in the hip and a prescription of Gabapentin.  The Dr&#39;s opinion was that it could take weeks to get better,  and discussed getting a referral to a neurologist.   Today is Thursday, April 29 and PT&#39;s  pain is still constant through the day at about a level 3-4 , but at night the pain level is severe.

                                                Five days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experience some numbness in the 4th and 5th fingers of my left arm, which was the arm of injection.  I also experience the beginnings of a strange metallic taste in my mouth.  Sort of an iron/zinc/copper taste in my mouth that tainted the flavor of the morning cup of coffee and the other things I ate.  I thought it might be something wrong with me -- like some sort of cancer or something, but saw that others had experience the same symptom.  The taste sensation disappeared on 5/10/2021, a month after my second dose of my COVID-19.  I am still am experiencing episodic numbness in the 4th and 5th fingers on my left hand.

Three weeks later on May 3, 2021 if felt fatigued by evening time and had chills and sweats all night.  No energy on May 4, 2021 and slept all day with bouts of chills and sweats but never had a temperature over 98F.  Woke up the morning of May 5, 2021 and discovered a large red patch centered over my left hip THR incision scar.  The incision scar was very sore and a dark purple.  I had a dull dehydration type of headache and had to urinate about every 20 minutes on May 4th.  Went to the emergency room and was diagnosed to have cellulitis and given a 7 day dose of antibiotics and 10 day dose of antiviral medication.  The rash never was very itch and started to subside immediately after taking the first dosage of these two medications.   Went to see my primary physician on May 10, 2021 and he believes I had vasculitis and not cellulitis.  No signs of any insect bites or cuts to have started the infection/inflammation. He noticed that blood vessels in and around the red patch which was about the size of a dinner plate were elevated to the surface.  Followed up with Dr on May 25th via telemedicine visit and he ordered another series of blood lab and urine tests on June 10, 2021, to make sure my ESR, CRP, and urinalysis results were continuing to decline.

The patient was fine going to bed the night before, but in the morning about 20 hours after receiving the shot the patient was unresponsive to wake up in the morning. He struggled to open his eyes, but was able to awake with some coaxing. His blood sugar was 175, but came down after taking measures to lower his sugar. He was able to get up and walk around, drive like normal within 2-3 hours after waking up. The patient&#39;s wife states the reaction was abnormal, nothing different occurred the night before, the only change was the vaccine administration.

                                                Patient was monitored for 1 hour after receiving his vaccine as requested by his primary care provider due to history of reaction to a previous vaccine. Patient monitored by EMS provider x 1hr, no s/s adverse reaction. Patient started walking out of facility on his own and came back reporting he felt dizzy. He was initially hypertensive with a pulse of 70, respiratory rate 12, systolic BP 188.  We had him lay down and about 10 minutes later his blood pressure was 140/70.   After another 10 minutes or so we had him sit and drink water but his dizziness, while improved, did not go away and he started to have chills and was visibly shaking so 911 was called as we did not feel he could drive himself home. Patient was monitored in the emergency department at Hospital x 1hr and released with blood pressure WNL.

No other symptoms except for mildly sore arm.  Had only one episode.  During the next 5 nights had similar events, but each was less severe than the previous event. I have had occasional mild night sweats associated with Zoloft in the past, but these in association with the vaccine were orders of magnitude  more severe

                                                Thursday Nite starting at 11 PM:  A warm feeling at the top of my head like a heat lamp.  Lasted 15 Minutes.  Then Left Leg, Two Toes start pulsating/shaking uncontrollably.  I rubbed with the right foot...it would stop...then start back up.  Lasted 30 Minutes.  Then my chest started feeling like I had a bad sunburn on my skin.  Lasted 30 Minutes...all the while these strange things were going on, I noticed I had asthma.  I ONLY get asthma if I have a cold or flu.  I thought to get up and take an inhaler but decided against it worried about an adverse reaction to the vaccination. I fell back to sleep and awoke with no asthma and all strange symptoms gone. Then Friday afternoon I developed chills and a queasy stomach (belching and gas and loose stools.)  I checked my temperature (on multiple occasions) and it was normal. These two conditions lasted until  Saturday.  Also on Saturday, I developed aches in my neck. Then very late Saturday Night, I awoke to a sweat drenched tee shirt but chills were gone. Sunday...today....I feel perfect.

                                                My oxygen levels dropped below what they had been previously as I am recovering from Covid infection  tested positive 20 October 2020.  If I do anything at all other then set my oxygen levels would drop into the low 80&#39;s.  I have also been monitoring my sugar levels.  I am not diabetic but did so because in ICU was using steroids which elevated sugar levels.  I continued to monitor it at home because I had to do injections for several weeks after leaving the hospital.  Have not had to use insulin til the other day.  Vision is very blurry.  Had that problem in the hospital but it has gone away but since I had the first vaccine everything is now blurry.  Left leg hurts to put weight on the heel. I have nerve damage to the left leg but this is a unique issue.  I&#39;m running a low grade fever 100.2 - in the morning it is normally 96.5-97.6 and this temperature was in the morning the day after the shot.  Neck is very sore.  I have rods from C3-C6 and the pain is in the muscle glands closer to the surface.  It is almost like it is attacking all areas of the body I previously had issues.  I spent October 25 - November 13 in Hospital, majority of time in ICU.

Muscle aches and pains, joint pain, lower back pain right side, headache.  Fever broke after 24 hours.  Some continued weakness for a couple days.  Then back to mostly normal.  10 days later, mild fever returned in the evening of 2/9, and 2/10, temp of 101.  These second rounds of fever went away during the day.  And temp was between 99.8 and 101.2. My question is:  Is it normal to get a mild fever 10 days after 2nd vaccine shot?

                                                I had a nasty reaction to 2nd dose of Moderna 8-12 hours after. Began with body aches and chills so severe it was hard to breath. No fever. When I got under covers and warmed up so chills subsided and breathing returned to normal it felt like I was being squashed in a Panini press. Every cell in my body felt like it was vibrating in pain. I had to get up ever hour or so to urinate. I would be back in sever chill mode before i made it to the bathroom and it took about 5 minutes back in bed for chills to stop and breathing back to normal. I was also nauseous the whole time but did not vomit Then. The room temperature was 72F. This continued for 12-14 hrs.  I then tried to drink cranberry juice and eat 3 bites of a banana which  I immediately regurgitated. The rest of the day I was drained of energy. No sleep 48hrs. 3 days

The next day the fever went away and started to feel better (48 hours later).  I also tested positive for Covid on 12/24/20, I didn&#39;t wait 90 days before I got my vaccine.  I felt awful with the second dose, almost worse than being in the midst of Covid. I&#39;m currently on Workman&#39;s Comp. I&#39;m constantly out of breathe and have no energy, I use to have tons of energy. From my atoms apple to my sternum I have tons of pain. My lungs feel like I&#39;m smoking and have tons of pressure.  My Dr. ran test because I have the worst head aches. I&#39;m like slow motion.

After 5PM mainly 101 fever, tired, muscle aches, headcahes, chills, hair follicles hurting ( had this when I had COVID-19 mid-March 2020); My symptoms from the 1st shot brought back memories of how the COVID-19 virus felt, except I did not have the congestion and sinus issues.  Fever broke at 3AM morning of March 13, woke up soaking wet, entire body and hair drenched as if I stepped out of the shower, did not dry off and got into bed. Felt fatigued Day 3 but feeling a lot better, able to be more active. Today is March 19, 8 days since shot #1 and my arm at the Vaccine site is still a bit sore, redness has subsided however.  Worried post shot 2 may be worse.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine:  I was recovering from a mild sprained ankle/foot  for about a week.  At the time of vaccination I had very little pain and could easily put full weight on the foot.  About 13 hours after the injection, I awoke to a throbbing foot and severe pain in that foot.  I could no longer apply any weight to it and it exhibited considerable swelling.  I visited the doctor and am now resting, icing, compressing, and elevating the foot.  Diclofenac Sodium was prescribed for pain.  Vaccine induced stimulation of an inflammation response is a possible explanation.

                                                In November of 2020 I was diagnosed with COVID 19 and subsequently recovered.  This was my first Moderna shot.  I took the shot in the right arm and completed my work day with no side effects.  I went to the gym that night - as usual - and wanted to &#34;work that arm&#34; a little.  I had a good workout, no issues.  Went home, ate and went to bed.  About 1 or 2 am I woke up with the hottest raging inferno flu-like fever I can recall having as an adult.  I did not want to alert my wife, so I simply stayed in bed and did not measure my fever level.  My guess is it was &gt;102.  Fever continued until a.m. and deep body pain hit me.  At dawn my fever measured 101.  I took acetaminophen and took a cold shower.  Fever subsided for a short while.  Then it came  back.  I felt weak and flu-pain so I stayed home from work and simply slept it off.  Symptoms slowly subsided by 7pm day 2.  Day 3 I was not 100% but I went to work and was fine.  No other symptoms since.

                                                After the first day I developed soreness at the injection site.  After about 2 days, the soreness moved to my left shoulder joint.  Currently, 8 days after the injection, my left shoulder joint remains sore and any motion to left my left arm laterally from my side is painful; like my joint is inflamed.  There is no redness or other visible external signs or discoloration.  I can not say for certain it is linked to the Modern vaccine as I&#39;ve had left shoulder issues infrequently in the past.  But timing wise, my current discomfort started shortly after receiving the vaccine.

I did not visit a doctor. I never had something like this before and nothing changed in my behavior or shoes. Just concerned about what they are and how to treat them.

                                                My left hand was in severe pain for maybe two hours. I took three Aleve to try and stop the pain. I could not close my hand into a fist, nor could I hold anything in my hand. No grip at all. My hand remained like this for most of her night. Today it is a little better, I can close my hand and make a fist, but I am unable to close tightly and grip anything. I feel as though the strength in my left hand is gone for now. No pain today but the muscles in my wrist and in my left hand are still somewhat tight  and present what feels like muscle tightness parallel to a pulling of the muscle. I rode my motorcycle to work yesterday, the morning ride was good, on the way home, my hand started with the pain thing. It was severe enough to prevent me from using the clutch lever properly. Presenting a lot of pain squeezing the lever to engage the clutch.

Always been rock solid at 98 with maybe a 97 every two months.  This is really an outlier event.  Reading taken on six different fingers with one monitor reset.  Returned to 98 following day.  Other expected symptoms:   Temp 99.8  (generally 97.6 - 98.0).  Injection shoulder sore, felt puffy (but no visual difference).  Medium &#34;Brain Fog&#34; (senses seemed disconnected, lack of concentration).  Lethargic legs (not sore or weak, just slow to respond).  Left neck and ear aches.  Slept about 14 hours day after shot.  No symptoms other than sore arm the day of shot.  BP and blood sugars up, but at higher end of my normal ranges.  BP 175/93  (16th).  (at 149/93 on 17th). Blood stick reading 198 (16th).  (at 158 on 17th)

                                                I received my second dose of Modena vaccine last Thursday (4/15) morning at 9am.  No initial reaction occurred.   Later that Thursday my arm got the expected tenderness, muscle ache. Towards evening, I got pretty tired and was starting to get some body aches, took 2 tylenol and went to bed at 9pm. Slept in late and was tired. Started to feel like mild flu which is what I expected.   Friday took some naps and continued mild flu symptoms. Went to bed about 8pm and got up at 5:00, feeling a bit better.   Saturday I continued to improve, arm was much better, less flu symptoms, didn&#39;t need tylenol, had turned the corner.  Cont&#39;d... Saturday evening was going to go to bed at 10pm and noticed my left cheek was kind of pressing against my gums - it was swollen. It continued to swell some but was not hindering my throat or breathing.   I decided to stay awake, keep an eye on it and if necessary would go to an emergency room. The swelling increased only slightly more over the next couple of hours to the size of maybe a golf ball (a bit less) on the left side and a much smaller amount on the right side. No airway effects. I did apply some ice but not sure if that had an effect. I slept for a few hours.   Sunday morning I did not take my medications as a precaution.   Sunday the swelling was slightly less and seemed to be going down a bit. I took 2 Benedryl at 11:00 am which really knocked me out, slept. Sunday evening the swelling was noticeably improved but not gone. Took 1 Benedryl at 10:00pm bedtime.   Monday still had a bit of swelling on left and right swelling is nearly gone.  No other symptoms.

By nighttime, had severe shaking, chills, profuse sweating &amp; unable to sleep.  We didn?t take temperature, but he finally stopped shaking mid-morning the following day.  Was weak and very fatigued two full days.  It was like an instant flu, but it was only the first jab and most reports of reaction seem to follow the 2nd.  Think it may be due to presence of antibodies post-COVID.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Tuberculosis.   On 18-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 15-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 15-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PARAESTHESIA (Left side of head fells like needles) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain), FATIGUE (Sleepiness and fatigue) and HEADACHE (Splitting headache on the left side of head/throbbing). At the time of the report, PARAESTHESIA (Left side of head fells like needles), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain), FATIGUE (Sleepiness and fatigue) and HEADACHE (Splitting headache on the left side of head/throbbing) had not resolved.     Concomitant medication was not reported. Treatment medication included paracetamol and oxycodone 5 mg.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable. Company comment:This case concerns a 63-year-old male with a serious unexpected event of paranesthesia, and non serious unexpected pain in extremity, and expected fatigue and headache. Event onset the same day as second dose mRNA-1273. Events ongoing. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 63-year-old male with a serious unexpected event of paranesthesia, and nonserious unexpected pain in extremity, and expected fatigue and headache.

                                                He got his vaccine, he had no reactions.  The next morning he woke up his arm was sore, and it was that was for 2 days.  Then his breathing starting getting worse.  He started coughing, couldn&#39;t lay down, could not sleep due to that.  He went to the ER and they told him that there was nothing wrong and that it was just allergies.  They told him to go home and take some OTC cold medicine and that everything would be okay.  A week later he went to another ER for the same thing as he continued not to be able to breath, they did a bunch of tests and said that nothing was wrong and that it was just a call.  He then went to Hospital ER and they released him stating it had just a cold.  He then called his cardiologist and they told him to go back to Hospital, was admitted on 5/11/21 and they did more tests and said that he had a blood clot in his left lung and said that it had nothing to do with the vaccine.   He was discharged on 5/13/21.  They put him on Heparin while in the hospital and sent him home as a disgruntled patient.   They also told him that he had fluid around his heart and gave him medicine to get that taken away.  They sent him home on Lasix and Eliquis.  He then went to another hospital on Friday 5/14/21 as he was going crazy about the blood clot and went there and was kept there for 3 days and discharged on 5/16/21 with the same medications, Lasix and Eliquis.   He was also told that he had fluid around his heart again.  Before the vaccine he was very healthy, and was able to jog around his neighborhood and now he&#39;s not able to do so, and they told him that he was now having heart failure and is having trouble breathing because his heart is swelling up.  He went to see his cardiologist last Friday and that&#39;s when she told him about his heart failure.    ADMISSIONS:  ADMITTED 5/11/21 TO 5/13/21; 5/14/21 to 5/16/21.

Secondarily, muscle tightness especially in legs (quads very tight). Coincidentally perhaps is development strained calf muscle during a run. Finally, and related to tingling.

                                                I recently had blood work done for an annual physical. The blood was drawn the same day I received the @nd dose of the vaccine.. I met with the Dr, 4 days later for my physical. He indicated my white blood cells were low and platelets were low. I did not have any adverse side effects other than a slightly sore arm. That particular blood test was accomplished, and the white cell count went back to normal and the platelets are improving, and I still feel no side effects. My primary care provider just wanted me to keep your company informed of the situation.

                                                This report concerns the aftermath of the second of the two Moderna vaccinations that I received:  Mild point of injection pain. Fever after 48 hours 100.4 F, lasted one day. Heavy night sweat on third night after shot. After about 10 days, a light but persistent rash developed on my upper right shoulder. Approximately a week later, I experienced :&#34;tingling&#34; through out my right shoulder. This right shoulder has had prior rotator cuff damage (in the early 1990s). The sensations of tingling in the shoulder are identical to those from the past,. There is also an itching sensation that is best described as &#34;inside the skin&#34;, not on the surface.   In the last two weeks, the rash has expanded to my right chest. There is little to no surface lesions or irritation, just itching and tingling as mentioned, with very slight raised bumps. None of these symptoms were present before the vaccination.  The tingling is heightened depending on arm position and when I am prone. There is no associated pain.  The itching, tingling, and rash have not gone away. Today is May 27th. I went to my family doctor today for other reasons, and mentioned the rash and post-vaccine reraction to him.

                                                Serious lower left back which I believe was my left kidney. The serious pain problems started the day after receiving the shot and lasted for at least two weeks.    As the kidney pain started, my fingers started to feel numb and they have felt numb ever since.  Left hand is a little worse then my right hand.  Want to get second shot but?? I have walking pneumonia since 1973, since I was 15 years old, and will die if I get Covid 19.  I need help to know what happened to me, and maybe monitor me during second shot.  I am open research person. I am a 64 year old man that has had walking pneumonia since I was 15 years old in 1973.  I know that if I do get Covid-19 I will quickly die.  I need vaccination from Covid-19.    I received my first Moderna Covid 19 vaccine on Thursday March 18th, 2021 after 3 PM and immediately had problems.  I had problems in my left lower back which I believe was my left kidney. The serious pain problems started the day after receiving my first Covid 19 Moderna shot and the pain lasted for at least two weeks.  Immediately as the kidney pain started, my fingers started to feel numb and they have felt this way ever since.    This lead me to the situation of &#34;I am damned if I do and damned if I do not&#34;.  I want to get the second Covid-19 vaccine shot because I am truly scared to die if I do get Covid 19.  But if I do get the second shot, what will happen to me?  I am scared that it may have the kidney pain again, may worsen my numb fingers problem, and/or do other damage to my body.  It may already have caused other problems?      In summation, whether I get the second Covid-19 vaccination shot or not:  Get the second shot: 1. Everything could be OK?   2. I could have Kidney pain again, possibly doing damage or more damage to my body, even my numb fingers could get worse!  Not get the second shot: 1. Be lucky and not get Covid-19. 2. Get Covid-19 and die.  I want very much to get the second Covid-19 shot, but I am scared and I find nobody cares about what had and has happened to me regarding my kidney pain and my fingers becoming numb, and any future consequences to me if I get the second shot.  I do not know what to do.  My current and main concern to me, for now, that if I do get the second Covid-19 shot I will get that kidney pain and may do worse damage to my fingers feeling numb or possibly other damage to my body.  I am not sure what happened, as a non medical person I can only guess things like maybe I have blood clots that reduce the circulation in my hands.  I just recently got on government assistance only because of this Covid-19 problem and I had a very hard time trying to find a job, I had no choice.  I have not been on government assistance long enough to get financially stable to afford medical insurance, but I plan to do so as soon as I can.    I tried to tell my doctor, but she kept telling me to go to the emergency room.  So, I finally went to the Hospital on Friday April 16th.  They checked my bloodwork and told me I was OK and OK to get the second shot, but I had really no explanation as to what had happened to me, my kidney, or my still numb fingers, or most of all, what might happen if I get my second shot.  I am hoping to get help, for someone to care about me, my health, and my future health.  The numbness in my left hand has been a little stronger than my right hand.  I had the shot in the left arm and my left kidney had the pain, if any of these matter. The left kidney problem was very painful within 2 days.  I could not do anything due to the pain.  I could forget about dealing with my feet in any way, such as to tie or untie shoes, put on or remove socks, getting out of bed, and just about anything I did, any movement at all was very painful.    What has me very worried is the continuous numbness of my fingers.  I want to get back to work and my profession involves computers and keyboards, and my numbness in my fingers bothers me, even having problem feeling the raised bump on the f&#39; and j&#39; keys.  The most immediate problem is trying to untie shoestrings, which I cannot feel to do due to my fingers feeling numb.  This problem with my fingers affect my life in many ways continuously everyday.  I cannot feel zip lock bag openings.  I have had a left kidney problem once before over 2 years ago, which I believe was a result of doing Benicar for my blood pressure. I have only had that problem that once and I got off Benicar and have never had the problem since, not until a day after I had my first Moderna Covid 19 vaccine shot March 18th.    For both of these times, the left kidney pain I immediately stopped all of my medicines and after a few weeks the pain went away.  This time was muc worse than the first time. I have high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol and take medicines for these.  I resumed these medicines after the pains went away.    As to the fingers feeling numb, I have never had this problem in my life.  My left hand fingers are a little worse than my right hand fingers.  They feel as if they are very cold for frozen, or I have burnt my fingers.  I have never felt this feeling ever in my life.  At the beginning of, January 1st to be exact, when I was 15 years old and in the 10th grade, I came down with pneumonia and was very sick.  It was not until the middle of March when my mother took me to the emergency late at night when she got a doctor to see me on the side.  The doctor gave me prescriptions of antibiotics, cough syrup, and Guaifenesin (which was a prescription in 1973 and is the main ingredient in Mucinex).   For the next 2 weeks I came home from school and laid down on the sofa and filled up about a third to a quarter of a medium size mixing bowl with phlegm from my lungs.  After that doctors have told me I ruined my lungs and I will have walking pneumonia for the rest of my life.  I have lived with this problem and have had to pay special attention to my lungs my whole life.    When I saw on TV a report on the second e-cigarette and what if did to the lungs, I said that looks like what happened to my lungs when I was 15 years old.  I recently saw news that someone had a similar problem.  However, because of my walking pneumonia I need to get the second shot or vaccinated in whatever way, I want to live.  Please help!

Later that night my arm started hurting and I felt a sharp pain in my forearm, my fingers felt like millions of needles were picking them in both hands, and I had severe abdominal pain just below the belly button. The abdominal pain was so severe that I was screaming out in pain and my wife had to hold me. I took three ibuprofen, still have the pain, but fell asleep. The abdominal pain went away the next day. The other symptoms took a few days to get rid of.

After showering it was all gone and has not returned. The evening after the vaccine, I started to experience a little pain in the left arm, especially the shoulder joint area. It did not prevent me from sleeping but did wake me when I rolled onto my left side. The pain was more severe the next morning but started to decrease after lunch. At 8 pm the day after it is just a dull ache now.

                                                I left the vaccination feeling nothing at all. I awoke the next morning with a moderate pain/discomfort in my left upper arm at the vaccination site. I went to work because I felt okay.  I have five years of recovery.  As a result every 8-12 moths I undergo an episode of about three days where my brain forgets how to sleep properly.  So the morning after my injection, I was on my second day of irregular sleep. Around 10 am, the side effects started kicking in.  I had a slight to moderate pain above my ear on the right side of my head.  I probably had a slight fever as I felt warm and sweaty for about four hours.  I felt slight to moderate chills during the height of my discomfort for about four hours.  I could hardly walk the five blocks to my girlfriend&#39;s home because I was very conscious of my breathing.  (I have been a heavy cigarette smoker for 4o years and an developing a heightened awareness of my breathing and pulse as I feel that I am overdue for a stroke or heart attack after 40 years of heavy smoking.)  Therefore his side effect was largely hypochondriacal.  I took off work yesterday even though the side effects had subsided. Today, I feel great. I feel so great that I laughed at the entry below - &#34;Patient Died&#34;.

Hospital where the ambulance took him initially diagnosed it as Bells Palsy and prescribed prednisone and an anti-viral.  After an MRI the next day on Monday, he was diagnosed correctly as a stroke.  On Tuesday, he was airlifted to another hospital and was in the ICU for more than 2 days. Patient spent the next 7 days in the neuro-trauma step-down unit with the results of the debilitating stroke.  He is unable to swallow and his entire left side is affected as well as vision and hearing.

                                                I experienced body aches and major fatigue right after receiving the vaccine on 03-04-21.  It was worse on the second day.  On the third day my right hip area and right leg was very sore and tender to the touch and noticed a rash on my hip area.  The rash spread all over my right leg and foot and the pain got worse.  My toes and foot became numb.  I took Tylenol and Aleve to relieve the pain for a few days however I did not improve for a week.  I visited an emergency care on 03-13-21 and was diagnosed with Shingles and I was prescribed Famiclovir.  I started taking  the meds as of yesterday and I am still experiencing pain all over my leg and numb foot.

                                                Eight minutes after the shot, I started felling unwell so I started my Apple Watch to see my heart rate.  It was at 86 and a minute later it was at 116 and a minute after that it peaked at 119.  It fell to mid 90&#39;s a couple minutes later, then went up to 105 fell back to mid 90s, then rose to 117, fell back to 80, and kept rising and falling until about 3pm.      The technician told me before my shot that it would be a few minutes as they had to do something the vaccine.  I don&#39;t recall what she told me.  I think she said they had to switch a vial or something.  You&#39;d have to ask her what happened before I had my shot.  This morning I have tingling in my thumb, forefinger and middle finger in the arm I got the shot.  I did sleep on the arm that had the shot .

                                                ADVERSE EVENT REPORT: MODERNA VACCINE 1 of 2 Dates: Feb. 17 to March 16, 2021  1. I received the first dose of the Moderna Anti-COVID19 vaccine at the Outpatient Clinic on Feb. 17, 2021 at 1:31PM. I have been suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI) for over four years. a. My condition is a combination of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia. Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b. GWI a neuro-immunologic disease that is still not well understood by the medical community.   2. Feb. 17, 2021. I received the FIRST MODERNA VACCINE SHOT on my right arm on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021. The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).  I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today. I have no fever. My injection site does not hurt.  My Rosacea became active today.  Today, I wore an N95 mask to ensure that I did get anyone in my family sick. They all wore their N95 masks. At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

                                                Left arm was sore for 2-3 days, then fine until I had carpal tunnel surgery on left hand 9 days after shot. Then on the same evening as surgery my covid vaccine injection site began to get red and hard and grew to approximately 3? in diameter. It was hot and red. This persisted for about 2-4 days then back to normal again?

                                                On 03/26/21 received my shot and about 20 minutes later i started to have side effects. My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

It remains the same as of 9:00PM EST this evening, although the itch has subsided. It remains warm to touch with little bumps in the raised area. No fever. The day before this reaction, I had my annual physical with no issues at the time. Prior to this reaction, 30 minutes after receiving the injection on 03/22/2021, I experienced a sudden red flush to my cheeks that lasted for only 15 minutes.  No swelling of face, neck, throat. No elevation in heart rate noted.  The evening following the day of injection, I had a 99.4 degree fever for about an hour, then fine. No fever since. No other reactions.

                                                Numbness and tingling in my right side of my face and right arm.  Went to Urgent Care but symptoms were gone.  Suggestion was to take baby aspirin.  The next day the symptoms came back and I went to the ER.  They drew blood samples and did a CT scan.  Everything appeared to be normal.  Referred to a neurologist but couldn?t get in until July.  Follow up the following week with my Dr.  She said since the CT scan showed no sign of stroke, cancer or tumor, there really wasn?t a need to get an MRI.  No further outbreak of symptoms.

Pt stated that he felt flush, warm/sweaty, and that his L arm was sore which was the arm that the vaccine was administered into at 1245. Water was given to the pt and vital signs were immediately taken and are as follows: BP-168/96, HR-98, O2-95%. The administration site was assessed and appeared normal. Additional assessment questions were asked to the pt regarding how he was feeling. Pt stated after vitals that he was beginning to feel better. Resource RNs stood with pt for a few more minutes until the pt stated that he was feeling completely better. Pt states that he had flu like symptoms with the first dose and that he is predicting that he will feel these same things again. Resource RNs educated pt on symptoms that warrant a call to his PCP or a trip to a medical provider. Resource RNs also advised the pt to call the health department in the event he has any adverse reactions to the vaccine. Pt then walked away with his sister.

                                                There was slight soreness in left arm where shot was given for a couple of days. This was expected and explained as a potential side effect by health personnel.  Next day or so, the lymph nodes (?) in left armpit began to be tender to touch and became inflamed or puffy. Has continued to get more sensitive and more inflamed/puffy as the week has gone on. Not real painful, but definitely can tell that is there, especially when showering and putting on deodorant. Hoping that it will subside in the next week.

                                                I received the shot in my right arm  at about 10:15 AM and was told to wait 15 minutes in my car in case of side effects.   After 15 minutes I had none so I left headed home. About 15 minutes into the drive I felt a tightness at first on the left side of my neck which then moved up into my cheek muscle and lip.   My face (left side) felt similar to having received a shot from a dentist but not as numb.  I then began to feel a sensation of numbness in the upper part of my left arm traveling down to my left palm.  The feeling in my arm felt as if I had been punched,  The feeling down the arm to the palm a numb feeling with a slight tingling like the development of pins and needles in my palm.   I got home about 11:00 AM 45 minutes after having received the vaccine and at that point the symptoms were beginning to dissipate..  At the time I am submitting this (12:23 PM) I only have a slight numb feeling in my upper arm.  Everything else is good. The site of the injection in my right arm is fine and I experienced no effects as of this point.

I went to the patient and found him unconscious and unresponsive. I told the technician to call 911 for EMS and I proceeded to remove the Epinephrine emergency pen from the emergency bag. The patient regained consciousness, I did not administer the epinephrine emergency pen. I remained with the patient. The patient complained of feeling hot, nausea and tired. Patient also appeared confused. Patient&#39;s head was cold to the touch. EMS  arrived and took the patient&#39;s vital signs. The patient&#39;s awareness  and tiredness appeared to vary from feeling fine and alert to confusion.  After about 15 minutes with EMS the patient choose to go with EMS to the Hospital Emergency room for observation. The patient walked about 15 steps then chose to go on the gurney with EMS.

Sunday, April 4 awoke with severe facial pain. The next day, Monday April 5, a small rash on the left side of the neck, above the collar-line was visible. It was obvious it wasn&#39;t a bug bite, nor a burn. It looked like possibly contact dermatitis, though there was no known cause.  Pt had a trip planned and left for out of town that morning (April 5); the place where he was staying in out of town provided Hydrocortisone cream &#43; Zyrtec. Over the next several days the pain continued &amp; the rash spread down his neck and up his neck, to his left cheek &amp; ear.  Pt went to urgent care on Thursday, April 8 and was diagnosed with herpes zoster. He was Rx: Valacyclovir He is still taking Valacyclovir -- the herpes vesicles are crusted over / healing

Fourth day also had chills, sneezing and runny nose.  Brain fog, fatigue and lack of coordination improved over the following days.  The second dose receive 4/13.  First day fatigure, chills, lack of coordination and muscle aches along with a lot of soreness at the site of the injection.  Second day also had dizziness, mild abdominal cramps and mild headache.  Could not eat until midday.  The third day dizziness, brain fog and lack of coordination continue.  Close to a point of seeking medical care but probably worth filing a report.

                                                Received vaccine approx 11:20am, no issues until 10:30pm when I started to feel chilled. I took my temp with a forehead thermometer and it read 98.x. I put the thermometer on my nightstand thinking it prudent to have it handy. In bed under covers I kept feeling cold and started shivering/teeth chattering, within an hour or so my forehead thermometer read 102. My recollection of the time between midnight and 2 to 3am is vague as I was very disoriented, I recall taking my forehead temp several times during those hours - that took a lot of effort, and I saw several readings of 105 and I believe one over 106. I remember thinking I should be in the ER, then thinking how could I get there, then thinking I would call 911 but that I could probably not get my mind/body to be able to physically make a phone call. I believe that during this time span I had brief periods of consciousness when I was somewhat aware that I was having a high fever event, but that there wasn&#39;t much I could do about it (I live alone). By 4am I was more aware, forehead temp reading was 102.something - I got up and made my way to the kitchen, I was unsteady on my feet and remember telling myself to be careful and not to fall. Temp gradually dropped throughout Tuesday, mostly back to normal on Wed.

Arrived at ER around 12:30 pm est on 4/5 (I walked into both places without assistance). They gave me Eloquis at hospital and I had slightly higher blood pressure than normal. Was discharged late in day on 4/6 around 5pm est. They gave me neuro eval every 2-3 hours and pulled blood constantly. They decided to start me on Crestor at hospital as well - was already on finofibrate, stopped fiofibrate aand fish oil and baby aspirin once I returned home

An another associate gave the patient water. Patient still had complaints of dizziness and I confirmed that the patient was not having an anaphylactic shock (patient was still able to breathe, talk, and no signs of swelling, hives, or itching). Proceeded to place patient to lay down with his feet elevated with feet with pillows and fanned him while store management and 911 was called. Continued to fan patient until ER services came to assist.

                                                I developed a numbness radiating from my left ear and cheek that goes as far as the top of my forehead to the lower part of my neck.  I also have numbness of the lips and gums but only on the left side.  It is always present but sometimes comes on stronger.  It is a bit alarming, wondering if I am having some form of a stroke.  There is no drooping of facial muscles and am able to raise both arms etc.  I almost felt this morning that I should go to emergency at the hospital, but was afraid they wouldn&#39;t be able to detect anything and didn&#39;t want to waste their time .

                                                The next day, I started to feel really weird. I had no energy and my head felt really strange. About a week and a half later, around 5am, the left side of my body started going numb. My wife took me to the ER. My BP was super high. About 6 hours later, the numbness started to go away. They performed various tests, but couldn&#39;t find anything wrong. They think I had a TIA, which is a blood clot that resolves itself. For the following month or so, I was just extremely tired and felt really crappy.

Then proceeded to get a slight noticeable increase in heart rate.   After setting for approximately 15 minutes I was released to leave. I mentioned to them that I just lived down the street and told them if I had any further issues or symptoms I would call them.  Approximately 30 minutes later I was having a slight lightning of the throat or airway and some slight tightness in breathing.  This tightness continued for approximately 2 hrs. I called the clinic and was attempting to get there recommendations but the nurse had left. I was told to get the ambulance personnel. As a prior EMT I felt that an ambulance was not needed at this time. I took 2 ea   Benadryl tablets and those symptoms lessened. Some numbness in lips and face, and felt heart beating in lips. That all subsided as well after taking Benadryl.  Still trying to get with a provider that could give me advise moving forward. The doctor was busy with an Emergency.

Slight and constant headache.

                                                About 35 minutes after the first vaccination my left forearm and hand starting tingling\numbness. It&#39;s at a very low level ( I can still function fine) but has not yet disappeared. It&#39;s like my left forearm and hand is slightly asleep and also effects my right arm at a much lesser degree.  I did report this to my doctor do feels its a localized reaction and advised me to continue with the second dose on 2/22/2021.

As my fifteens was up , I started getting severe heightened sense of smell and could smell body odors from people all around me. Threw up before exiting building in rest room.Needed to get out of building ASAP fast for fresh air . Breathing-20 degree fresh air maskless helped but still felt weak so wife and medical aids brought me inside to isolated area on a cot to rest and take vitals .

I first noticed mild tinnitus the day after the injection and it gradually became worse over two weeks. [not recovered] 2) Sore arm - I had a hard time lifting my arm the evening of the injection. I recovered in a day. [recovered] 3) &#34;COVID arm&#34; - My right arm became red swollen and itchy for about three days, starting a week after the injection. [recovered]

                                                Approximately 16 minutes after receiving the vaccination, I began to get quite dizzy.  The staff was notified by my wife; and, a Pharmacist responded immediately to check on me.  As minutes passed, I became more dizzy and was experiencing a mild &#34;out of body&#34; type experience as though I was in some sort of a dream.  Knowing in advance that many people had experienced adverse reactions from these vaccines, my wife and I had brought along an &#34;eppie pen&#34; in the event I might experience something similar.  The problem was that my &#34;pens&#34; had expired in 2015.  My condition improved when I lifted my facemask to get more air.  While the Pharmacy was obtaining a new &#34;Eppie pen&#34; for me, the Pharmacist told me to take the mask off.  This stabilized me until  we left after 45 minutes.  I did not need to use the new Eppie pen.  Still dizzy, my wife helped me to my vehicle.  Enroute, being somewhat weak, I clasped against a parked car and to the pavement.  During the trip home, my muscles began to ache and my joints stiffen and hurt.   A heaviness began to present on my upper chest.

Approximately 25 minutes after receiving the vaccination, I became flush, felt hot and had a red face and neck.  I felt lethargic and a little dizzy.    The redness diminished throughout the rest of the day and for the next day I felt a little lethargic, dizzy, and weak in the knees.  I returned to the facility and EMTs took my vitals.  My blood pressure was slightly elevated but, no other negative indications.  They released me.

By 2/2, the patient experienced arm soreness, and  by 9PM, he felt pain in his right ear. On the morning of 2/3, the patient woke up with hearing loss in his right ear, slight dizziness and nausea, but was able to work and eat with normal appetite. On 2/4, the patient woke up with general malaise, dizziness, lightheaded feeling, GI discomfort (minor diarrhea and vomiting), sweating, and chills. The patient still experienced hearing loss. The patient was fatigued, and had no appetite; stayed hydrated and slept most of the day. The patient gradually became less fatigued and  gained appetite from 2/5-2/8.

He said he didn&#39;t have any additional breathing trouble. He was fine the next day. Patient had been hospitalized with COVID-19 last summer and was aware that he would most likely have that type of reaction since his body had made B Cells and T Cells to the virus. He was very knowledgeable and kind.

                                                Woke to profound chills and shaking despite no appreciable moisture present on skin. This subsided in appx. 30 minutes however I suffered a very poor night?s sleep. Following day, Feb 20, 2012, I felt as though I had a very mild virus with achiness in neck and shoulders primarily with lesser discomfort in back and legs. Was a mildly fatigued with mild headache as well. Did not check temp but never felt feverish.  On 2/21/2021 I felt symptom free until evening when a slight trace of achiness returned. I slept very well that night and woke symptom free, encountering  no further reactive symptoms.

I remaining in bed off and on for about 36 hours and then worked my way back to eliminate most of the symptoms.  However, after that and continuing at this time, i continue to be achy, particularly in my joints and my hands, fingers and neck, and I find that my lower jaw seems to be moved forward when I awake in the morning.  The achiness is particularly acute when waking in the morning, particularly in my fingers..  The pain is by no means debilitating, but it is noticeable.  I would rate the pain 3 or 4 when waking and 2-3 throughout the rest of the day.     I have not sought any treatment.

Ended up going to bed very early that evening (7:30) I woke up in the middle of the night covered in sweat, a fever of 101.4 degrees.  I woke up at 10:00am the next day still running a fever but on 99.4 but still ackey and tired throughout the whole day. I took a short nap in the afternoon. I woke on the 3rd day after my shot and all I have now is a little soreness in my armpits, fatigue and aches are gone.

                                                I had sharp pain in my left wrist that went into my hand and up my left arm into the shoulder.  After a few day, I contacted my doctor, but it was subsiding by the time I saw him.  In about a week, it flared up again so I made an appointment with a hand specialist.  He believes I have a carpel tunnel issue.  The pain went away on its own after another week or so.  It returned again after my second dose of the vaccine, as well as other side effects that I will report for the second dose.  I also had some pain at the injection site that lasted for only a few days.

                                                A little over 12 hours after getting my first Moderna shot I experienced severe joint pain in my left knee that caused my entire left leg to become so painful I could not move it at all, as if I pulled an ACL. I decided to ride it out as each day went by the pain subsided more and more to where after 3 to 4 days later the pain was about 90% gone.  I still feel a little bit of soreness on the left side of my left knee cap though.  I am mostly back to where I was before the shot.  During the first few hours of the worst pain I did experience a cold sweat also.  All in  all I am feeling pretty good now however, a bit concerned about my second dose scheduled for March 23rd though, especially considering that I have neve had a negative reaction to a any type of vaccine before and I am not allergic. Great thanks to all!

He then started with some shortness of breath and wheezing the next day.  He then used his inhaler to get through the symptoms quicker and it did help. Patient notes that within 22 hours of having the shot his symptoms then resolved.  He is not having any further issues or symptoms from the COVID vaccine at this time.

I felt a rush come over my body followed by rapid heart beat. These symptoms lasted about 2 mins then subsided. I really didn`t want panic everyone  or go to the hospital all I wanted was fresh air so I left, admittedly not my smartest move but I knew my doctors office was right across the street.  After 24 Hrs. still Light Headed, no breathing issues, heart rate normal  sore arm no rash.

                                                Seen at the walk-In clinic on 3/9/2021 where he presented with complaints of right leg weakness, numbness, and tingling.  He was transferred to ER for further evaluation and management.    The symptoms (numbness in his hip and thigh) began around 1400 while he was working.  He went about his day. The symptoms progressively worsened while he was ambulating around the hardware store. In the ER, his sensation of his right leg was dulled as compared to the left. The numbness extended from his hip to his toes. Felt a pressure-like sensation in his thigh and calf.  Denies pain. Felt as though his right foot is floating 2 inches off the ground when standing with both feet on the ground. Reported his right leg is 1-2 inches shorter after a femur fracture many years ago. Nothing made his symptoms better or worse.  Did have an episode of feeling generally hot and then cold the evening prior to admission. Denied any trauma.     Denied any dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in stools, urinary habit changes, hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, myalgias, arthralgias, recent illness, or fever.   MRI showed T2 changes on the right side of the cord down of the thoracic spine concerning for her transverse myelitis.  Patient did have Covid vaccine 7 days prior to onset of symptoms, one dose mRNA vaccine.    He is on day 3 high-dose methylprednisolone thousand milligrams IV ×3 days.  He has noticed an improvement in the pressure sensation from the knee up the thigh on the right, no longer having tingling in the right lower leg or the left foot.  He is still having numbness over the anterior right thigh.  Yesterday when he went to bear weight on the right heel, he had a sharp pain with increase in weakness.  That has since settled down.  He did have a few involuntary myoclonic movements as described yesterday.  This writer reached out on 3/22/2021 for information on his Vaccine lot number. He stated &#34;At this point I am attending physical therapy, I am walking with the aid of crutches or a walker. There is improvement in the foot and lower leg regarding the numbness, but the upper thigh is still pretty much completely numb yet.&#34;

The patient&#39;s medical history included COPD, congestive heart disease and chronic problems with his back. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 4 Jan 2021, 17 days prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot batch: 026L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Jan 2021 the patient had an unexpected reaction. He got up that morning and felt fine, but as the day went on, he noticed that when he spoke, the left side of his mouth was not moving, then he noticed his left eye was not closing and that side of his face was drooping. He was not in any pain at that point. He made an appointment to see his general doctor the next day, 22 Jan 2021, after the exam he was diagnosed him with Bell&#39;s Palsy (BP) and referred him to a neurologist and ophthalmologist. The earliest he could see the ophthalmologist back was next week and he could not get the neuro to call him back. His doctor prescribed him prednisone which he completed after 7 days but said the BP symptoms have not improved. Then on Saturday, 30 Jan 2021, he started feeling extreme pain behind his left ear. Everyday the pain got worse. His pain medications were not helping the pain behind his left ear. He could not see out of his left eye and he could not blink. The event left side of his face was drooping was considered as medically significant.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events left side of his face was drooping, extreme pain behind his left ear, can&#39;t blink, and his left eye was not closing was not provided.

                                                3 days after 1st vaccine dose I developed neuropathy in my left foot.  Most of bottom of foot was/is numb,  For first five days it was center of sole of foot, then moved to heel and ball/toes.  It remains numb and mostly unchanged.  (This foot has mild motor nerve damage from a severe ruptured disc 30 years ago.) I initially did not associate the vaccine with this symptom.  But on February 12 I had the second dose, and precisely 3 days later developed neuropathy in right foot (numbness, not as pronounced as left foot) and tingling in forearms/hands.  That was about 6 weeks ago.  Symptoms remain persistent but not worsening.  No history of neuropathy prior.

                                                I initially had pain in left shoulder, some chills and light headiness. Those dissipated by the second day. But 5 days later I developed a hematoma in my left bicep. It was like someone punched my arm as it was purple and red. Within a few weeks it turned to a brown and yellow and currently no coloring. However, my shoulder is tight and some pain and my bicep is experiencing tightness and pain. The Dr who administered the shot was not wearing gloves and injected the vaccine towards the rear of the shoulder and caused me to bleed. I usually coagulate well.  My shoulder has discomfort and when moved side to side has a crackling and clicking.  I had Torn labrum surgery approximately 4 years ago.

Eventually contacted my physician. Saw orthopedic Dr. ?Osteoarthritis was initial diagnosis?but that didn?t explain arm / shoulder pain.   Subsequent blood tests showed high inflammation levels.  Diagnosis became Polymyalgia Rheumatica. Began taking Prednisone on 5/19/21.  No longer have pain in hips but still have some pain in shoulder.

The day of the vaccine I started to have tightness like a Broncho Spasm in my chest 30 minutes after the vaccine.. My co-workers told me I was flushed. I was a little short of breath and my pulse was elevated.  It seemed to improve after a little time. I started to feel worse on 01/12/2021. Ten days after the vaccine I tested positive on 01/14/2021for Covid-19. I had serious symptoms with the Covid-19. After five months I have been unable to work as a Physician and I am still having. I recently got tested for Polyethylene Glycol and I tested positive on a skin test. I am unsure whether to get the second dose. I also have headaches and memory defects muscle aches weakness and a weak left arm. My headaches happen daily and they vary in severity. I am scheduled to have a Bifrontal MRI tomorrow. I started to have problems with concentration within a week of the vaccine and I am still having problems with that. I experience muscle and body aches as well as neck and shoulder problems. My energy level is improved but still very low. I am scheduled to see a Neurologist. My left arm is very weak from the shoulder to the forearm since that time Radiculopathy.

On February 28th I started a very symptomatic AFIB, breathless with little energy and stamina , it lasted 8 days which is double previous events.  It then subsided and recurred about 2 weeks later for 11 days.  Again a severe episode which prompted me to seek out medical help.  I just finished a cardiac ablation because of these episodes.  They were far more severe and  persistent than previous events.

Came back to clinic at 0800 on 01/06/2021 c/o excruciating pain in entire L arm radiating to neck, chest, and around his upper and lower back. States it started the evening of 01/04/2021 and progressively has gotten worse. States it woke him up at 0130 on 01/06/2021 and that he hadn&#39;t been able to get back to sleep because of the pain. Rated pain 9.5/10. No redness or s/s of infection at injection site. Some swelling present at the site. L forearm and hand were slightly erythematous, and he was unable to move arm or fingers much. RN had to assist with putting his jacket back on. States has tried ice packs, tylenol, ibuprofen, tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone with no relief. BP 143/93, P 77, RR 22, O2 sat 96%. Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

                                                Just wanted to touch basis regarding side effects to the Moderna vaccination.  I received the first vaccine yesterday evening, today I have experienced a low grade fever, tiredness, chills, weakness and a headache.  BP was 129/67 this AM. I understand these are some typical symptoms but thought it would be good to communicate.  Unfortunately the test samples were low in this ethnicity, low in senior citizens, and kidney disease is not listed.  Only a very small percentage had two extenuating conditions; while I have diabetes, CKD, hypertension/previous heart related disease.  I understand that the second vaccination could present even more severe side effects.  Any thoughts?

                                                About 36 hours after the vaccine during the middle of the night the patient woke up with swelling of the R side of his face and pain. He went to the dentist the next morning who diagnosed him with parotiditis. He also saw a NP at his PCP office that afternoon. He was started on Augmentin and took ibuprofen with improvement of symptoms. Symptoms were mostly resolved by 1/31.  It is unclear if this was related to the vaccine, but given the timeline decided to report it.

                                                Paresthesia left arm dermatome of T1.  Altered sensation when touching area only. No pain. Could be actual T1 disc and coincident to vaccine, but this is a first time event. Start date is uncertain as the paresthesia is only noted when rubbing/touching the area.  However, highly unlikely that the start was prior to the vaccine. Note that I intentionally lay in bed reading in a prone position prior to sleep which could compress the C&#39;s and T1. This a long time practice, and again, this is a first time event.

                                                I had COVID19 Vaccines EUA on 1/12/21 &amp; 2/9/21. Most adverse effects I had after the first shot. On the same day around 7:30 p.m. head started to burn and the rest of my body shiver. Whole body skin became super sensitive - it hurt to move sharply. I took Tylenol 1300mg and Advil LiquiGel 400mg. Temperature was up &amp; down (97 to 100.7) for 2 days. Friday 1/15 temperature became normal, but my body started to feel severe muscle twisting aches and that continue for 4 days straight. I&#39;ve continue to take Tylenol and Advil every 4-6 hours. After muscle aches subsided on Tuesday 1/19, all joints started to hurt (two days of nagging &amp; strong pain, most-knees &amp; hands). Suddenly I started to cough for no apparent reason.

He has allergies to bees/egg and a h/o anaphylaxis 2/2 receiving an injection of penicillin in the past. Discussed that prior h/o anaphylaxis to PCN injection was not a contraindication to this vaccination, but is a precaution. Discussed risks of receiving the vaccination vs benefits of the vaccine, which patient states &#34;I already had this discussion with Dr.!&#34; He has multiple comorbidities which place him at a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19. Again received the risk vs benefit discussion. Patient stated understanding and desire to proceed with the vaccination. He will be monitored for at least 30 minutes in area where staff can directly observe him. Patient received the COVID vaccination at 13:00. At 45 minutes later, staff alerted that he was c/o palpitations. Due to confusion and weakness, we were unable to transport him to an examination room. Oxygen, water, and vitals machine were brought to him. He presented with SOB, confusion, lightheadedness. Exam demonstrated acute distress, speaking in staccato sentences. HR in 80s, with lungs CTAB and no stridor - despite increased RR to 20s. Vitals with HR in 70s, SpO2 remained 97% or greater on RA. BP was initially 140/72. A code blue was called and Drs. presented to the area. Patient c/o itchy throat and still p/w confusion/combativeness, loss of orientation, and SOB. No visible swelling noticed. At around 13:58, patient syncopized. HR and SpO2 remained 70-80s and &gt;98% on room air respectively. Pulse remained palpable. At that time, an epipen was administered. Patient woke up. During the entire episode, he was able to recognize a staff member with whom he was previously familiar. EMS arrived, vitals remained stable. EMS transported patient to the ER for further monitoring and f/u. Concern for immediate allergic reaction 2/2 vaccination. After event, patient in need of referral to allergy provider for evaluation prior to consideration of 2nd dosage.

The jittery feeling subsided in about an hour. The chills remained and I got flushed and felt like i had a temperature. My joints in my hands felt very sore and during the night my body muscles felt wore out. My left shoulder at the site of the shot was throbbing  bad. For some reason I had to urinate every hour for the next five hours of the night without ingesting any more fluids. By 7:00 AM I got to feeling progressively better and by 9:30 AM I felt like I had just had a very poor nights sleep. No more chills, fever, being flushed and the pain in my arm subsided substantially.

                                                My first vaccination was given at Medical Center, on 1/27/21.  Medication was Pfizer, Lot # EL3302.  At time of scheduling I was told that I could get my second vaccination at facility, which was  about 50 miles closer to my home.  The scheduler verified that facility administered both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.   On 2/16, when I reported to facility for my second shot, I reminded the intake person and the one who escorted me to the vaccination station that I needed the Pfizer vaccine, and was told by both people that  Pfizer was in the record and that I would receive that vaccine.  The person who escorted me to the vaccination station brought the syringe to the vaccinator, who asked me my name and date of birth, administered the shot, and handed me the post-administration paperwork.  While seated in the waiting area I read over my paperwork and reviewed my dosage record card and discovered, that I had been  given the Moderna vaccine., against the CDC guidance and without prior notification to or authorization by me.  I have subsequently experienced shortness of breath, an unusually high level of  nasal congestion, nad a serious lack of energy.  These symptoms began about 72 hours after the second vaccination.

His blood pessure was very low and he had a fever , so I called paremedics, and they took him to the hosp.  After many tests, they found blood in the urine, and his blood platelets had dropped to 121.( Now he had blood work done in June of 2020 and his platelets were 225.)  After a few days, his platelets began to creep back up, and are now around 165, back to normal range. He is currently at a rehad facility for physical therapy to regain strength.

                                                My 1st Covid-19 vax was on Saturday 02/13/2021. On Friday 02/26/2021 I had pain in my right ankle and foot and thought it was possibly just another bruise. Saturday evening 02/26/2021 I realised it was a blood vessel popping out. On Tuesday 03/02/2021 I had an ultrasound and it was diagnosed as a &#34;superficial thrombosis&#34;. It goes from the inside of my right foot to the top of the foot. Then it can be seen on the inside of my ankle, skip a spot, and is again visible on the inside of my calf. It ends mid-calf on my right leg.

                                                Went into convulsions approximately 12 hours after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.  Thought he was going to die.  Attempted to dial 911, could not pick up phone due to convulsions.  Is more scared of dying of COVID than of dying of vaccine, so will be going in for 2nd dose and wishes to remain anonymous.

Went to bed shortly thereafter. Woke two or three times in the night. Began feeling somewhat warm instead of chilled (except for extremities, which remained cold to the touch). Felt weak and temporarily dizzy each time of getting out of bed. Awoke at one point with a headache, so took one Excedrin migraine tablet. Took a second Excedrin migraine tablet later in the morning of March 18, 2021, since headache persisted. Other than that, took no other prescriptions or supplements until the evening of March 18, 2021. Throughout March 18, 2021, patient felt occasional periods of weakness and took bedrest for it. Probably slept an additional 3 to 4 hours during the day. By evening of March 18, 2021, patient was feeling more normal. On March 19, 2021, patient experienced no adverse effects.

                                                After experiencing chills, fever, hot flashes and stomach aching, extreme swelling around the left eye occurred to the point that there was no vision possible. This swelling lasted for more than 2 full days. Began to subside several hours after taking prednisone to reduce swelling.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy; A spontaneous report was received from a 66-years-old male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced Bell&#39;s palsy.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch not provided) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Three to four days after receiving the vaccine, the left side of the patient&#39;s face was frozen. The patient was rushed to the emergency room because he thought it was a stroke. The physician confirmed that was not a stroke, and diagnosed Bells&#39; palsy. The patient reported that he spent 6 hours in the hospital and the doctor prescribed him prednisone and valacyclovir. The patient reported feeling better now.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was unknown.  The outcome of event, Bell&#39;s palsy, was considered recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Lower legs felt tired and sore., muscle pain. Progressively got worse over the month of February making it nearly impossible to bend, raise and lower myself. Saw my personal doctor on March 1st. He does not think it is vaccine related. Rans some bloodwork tests. Put me on Prednisone for 3 weeks. That did alleviate the muscle soreness/stiffness  but that seems to be starting to return now that I am no longer taking it. Have a Dr. appointment with a Rhuematologist on Friday 3/26/2021.

The pain got worse by 8:00 pm. I though I might somehow got it hurt somewhere.  I massage the pain area and place the foot and lower leg in a bucket   filled with warm water. Those did not help. I went to bed at ~8:30 pm and felt the whole right leg  very uncomfortable. The dull pain came from the foot and extended to the whole leg,  I felt the foot and leg were swelling but they were not. By 12:00 am the pain became less and totally gone by 7:00 am, I urinated four times over night and had severe sweating in the second half of the night.   I  feel alright the next day, just some kind joint/musel  uncomfortable.

                                                My left arm is in excruciating pain I cannot use nor could I sleep first night. Arm is almost dead in some ways. I cannot life past my mouth as cannot even extend very well.  Severe pain, aching also pain down shoulder into right hand. I have tried icing, heat, applied Cold spray. It is slightly painful 2 days later but still lots of pain. I cannot use arm to do chores. Even brushing teeth was hard. Arm was fine till 10 hours later then became worse and worse. Plus have little strength in arm. I cannot use arm to dry myself after shower.  Arm continues to be painful, aspirin does nothing to alleviate pain.  I regret getting vaccine and have doubts to complete series as I heard second shot worse.  I have not sought treatment yet but may go see my PCP this week.

I was very tired, slept most of the day, and felt some joint pain and mild nausea.  I woke up today (second day after second shot) feeling a little tired, but basically fine, without symptoms.

                                                Extreme pain and weakness in the right leg [mid thigh to lower calf].  Unable to walk or climb steps.  Unable to stand unsupported.  Right leg buckles and gives out.  Unable to travel, or see my doctor.  The onset of my issues were very sudden and immediate, no lead-up.  In a sitting or lying down position, I am able to freely articulate and rotate my right leg without pain.  In the nine days since the onset, I have treated myself with Aleive and a heating pad for my neck.  The issues have lessened by less than 25%.        Background:  due to spinal cord injury in 1996, I have permanent damage; sensory issues on my right side [mid chest to foot], and motor issues on my left side.

                                                Day after receiving my second vaccine, I had a high fever and chills.  On the second day the fever was lower, around 100 -101 F, but the fever persisted for 7-8 days at 99-100 F.  No other significant symptoms other than those associated with the fever, low energy, etc.  Other than reduced activity and acetaminophen, I rec&#39;d no other treatment.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

                                                Facial drooping; Slurred speech; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning a 66-year-old male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed facial drooping/facial paralysis and slurred speech/dysarthria.   The patient&#39;s medical history included pulmonary fibrosis. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 21 Jan 2021, prior to onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch number: unknown) in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 21 Jan 2021, the patient developed facial drooping (medically significant) and slurred speech. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events.     Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.     The outcome of the events facial drooping and slurred speech was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On 3/27/21, he got a fever that ranged between 99.7 to 102.6.  He could not eat and thinking about it made his stomach upset.  Every bone and joint in his body ached, even his skin hurt and he had a bad headache.  Tylenol did little to alleviate any of these symptoms.  His fever  broke on 3/27/21 about 11 pm.  He still did not sleep well and slept until noon on 3/28/21.  His symptoms persisted except for the fever, though he still had chills that night.  He still did not feel well throughout 3/29/21 and 3/30/21 and he still ate very, very little until 3/31/21.  On 3/31/21, he was able to eat and went to the grocery, but it wiped him out and he slept for a couple of hours in the afternoon.  He still has a dull headache and very little energy that is keeping him from doing his daily activities.

                                                Patient received Moderna vaccine dose #1 on 3/3/21 at approximately 0900.  In the afternoon of 3/4/21, patient had sudden onset shortness of breath while at home, as well as fatigue and low energy. Patient knew that a potential side effect of vaccine was fatigue, so he assumed this was just a normal side effect to be expected. States that his difficulty breathing and fatigue continued for about a week. After continued urging from wife to seek medical care, patient visited urgent care center on 3/15/21. The urgent care did a D-Dimer lab, and an x-ray of chest. X-ray &#34;showed something abnormal&#34; so they did a CT scan as well, which showed a &#34;huge pulmonary embolism.&#34; D-Dimer lab was elevated. Patient was transported to hospital by ambulance and had immediate surgery to remove blood clot from lungs at approximately 2100 on 3/15/21. Per patient, the surgeon said the clot was about the size of his palm. Surgeon reported that there was &#34;100% blockage to left lung from the aortic artery and 90% blockage to right lung from aortic artery.&#34;  A DVT in popliteal vein was identified, and the surgeon assumes the clot started in the popliteal vein and broke off and traveled to lungs. Patient was admitted and hospitalized until he was discharged home on 3/18/21. During course of hospitalization, genetic testing was done and it was determined that the &#34;genetic marker for clots was negative, so they think the clot is from a one-time event--patient&#39;s family does not need to be concerned that they have clotting issues.&#34; Patient states that he was started on heparin in the hospital, and was discharged home on Eliquis blood thinner, which is being tapered. Patient states that the doctors think he will be on Eliquis for about 6 months and will not need to be on it for life. Doctors say the DVT in leg will dissolve on its own. During hospitalization, an echogram and cardiac cath was performed, which showed &#34;an old heart attack on the left side, but that collateral vessels have built up already.&#34; Right side of heart was weaker from having to work so hard due to blood clots in lung, but prior to discharge from hospital, the right side of heart was already showing improvement. A heart cath was done to check vessels and it was determined no stents were needed, although there was a small clot in left anterior descending artery. Patient was also newly diagnosed during course of hospitalization with Type II Diabetes in a non-obese person, HTN (which patient had never had before), Coronary Artery Disease, Hyperlipidemia, 1st degree AV block. Was discharged home with metformin, losartan, chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, and Aspirin. The chlorthalidone was discontinued, due to &#34;blood pressure dropping too low--they think his high blood pressure was situational&#34; per wife of patient. Medical doctors advised against receiving the 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. Patient being followed by Internist at hospital.  Patient&#39;s shortness of breath resolved &#34;immediately after clot was removed&#34; but is continuing to be followed while on new medications and blood thinner dosing.  The above information was provided during telephone interview of patient and his wife.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (10 day hospitalization and administration of oxygen therapy) on 01-Nov-2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension and Diabetes mellitus.    On 02-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ASTHENIA (weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). In March 2021, the patient experienced BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal). The patient was hospitalized from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to AGEUSIA, CONSTIPATION, DYSSTASIA, GAIT DISTURBANCE and POLLAKIURIA, and then from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to ASTHENIA. On 06-Mar-2021, GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) had resolved. On 24-Mar-2021, ASTHENIA (weakness), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) and AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) had resolved. At the time of the report, POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination), BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant medications were not provided by the reporter. Treatment History includes ER visit, hospitalization, IV fluids, IV medications, &#34;injections for blood sugar&#34;, EKG, scope to check for blood clots, physical therapy.  Based on the current available information, a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship with the events cannot be excluded.

                                                About 14 hours after receiving my second shot of the vaccine, I awoke being very cold and began to shiver and shake almost violently after getting out of bed to urinate.  Also my back, hips and knee joint were aching when I moved about any at all.  I was able to fall back to sleep and in the few time I awoke during the rest of the night, I didn&#39;t experience the shaking, however, with the aching and feeling cold, it was reminiscent of times when I had a fever.  Unfortunately, I do not have a working thermometer, so I could not check this, but I suspect I did have a fever.  I was also experiencing a sort of mental brain fog of confusion and lack of full consciousness (felt like I could not bring myself awake enough to do much of anything).   The following morning, I was barely able to become awake enough and clear headed enough to send an email to my boss about having to miss work.  Except to get out of bed for a short time to use the bathroom or get something to drink, I slept most of Friday until late afternoon.  Then I was slightly more coherent and was able to get more to drink and eat.  But still sleepy and went back to sleep. I awoke in a sweat (not experienced before this time) and felt a little clearer in my mind and not as achy.  Slept again later through the night, but continued to wake up in a sweat during the night.  Finally this morning when I awoke, I felt more normal again.

                                                Tremor developed shortly after second vaccination in early February and does not appear like it will go away over time.  Upon questioning, tremor occurs both with intentional movement and at rest.  Tremor severity varies without a clear pattern for time of day.  It occurs almost continually now.  Sometimes it is mild, but still annoying.  At times it can be severe enough to interfere with daily life and work activities.  could not think of anything else except vaccination to explain the sudden occurrence of the tremor.  He has no family history of tremors.  He reports that he thinks that he had COVID in March 2019, but no testing to confirm.  There was not sign of a tremor until after the second vaccination.

                                                Friday night noticed pain and a blistery rash on face and forehead.  By Saturday evening, there was a blister very close to eye, so sough medical care.   Definitely Shingles!  Dr. checked eye to be sure there were none in eye, and there weren&#39;t.   Prescribed generic Valtrex, which was begun Sunday afternoon (unable to get sooner due to pharmacies being closed).  Quickly was resolved, we believe largely due to Shingrix vaccine, received in 2018.  May have had mild symptoms (headache, etc.) day or so previous, but nothing major.

On the seventh day post vaccination, he noticed he was unable to drink well from a straw because his mouth would not close normally.  His symptoms did not improve, and on the ninth day, he noticed drooping of his face and went to the ER, where he was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy.  He has improved some now and states, &#34;I&#39;m getting better every day.&#34;  He continues to receive physical therapy and reports his speech is improving, and he is now able to close his eye on the affected side.

Until today, I had thought they were separate incidents with no common thread.  I now can see the possibility that they may be related.  I am asking for competent and engaged medical help to determine whether this is so, and if not, what the causes are for my issues.  I will give a brief medical history to give some current perspective.  Health History Current Vital Statistics ? Age: 66, Gender: Male, Height: 6?3?, Weight: 245  Hemorrhoidectomy ? In 1999 I had a hemorrhoidectomy to stop episodes of severe bleeding.  Heart Attack ? In August 2000 I had a heart attack, diagnosed as unstable angina, while on vacation.  They did further tests, found blockages and inserted stents in two arteries.  I was sent home with instructions to contact a cardiologist.  AICD ? After returning home, my new cardiologist did further tests and found evidence of ventricular tachycardia.  I was sent to a specialist who did an electrophysiology study and immediately implanted an AICD.  I have had it replace twice, with the latest one in April 2012.  It has never gone off.  There are close to five years left on my current battery.  Knee Replacement ? In January 2015 I had a total knee replacement of my right knee.  That was a result of several injuries and four surgeries, which left the knee without cartilage.  The knee replacement has worked flawlessly, and I am able to pursue athletics, especially playing tennis, without limitation.   Current Situation February 23 ? Received my first shot of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm.  Other than minor soreness around the injection site, I had no other reaction.  March 29 ? Received the second shot of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm.  Again, there was minor soreness around the injection site.  April 2 ? Had major pain in my tightness in my chest and major pain starting in my left shoulder and radiating down my left arm.  It caused significant discomfort, and I was awake a large part of the night deciding whether I need to call 911 for a possible heart attack.  I decided against that and instead went to urgent care in the morning (April 3).  My EKG was normal, my blood pressure was elevated (158/96 sitting, 157/91 standing).  Doctor could find nothing to suggest heart attack.  Prescribed a course of Prednisone for the shoulder/arm pain.  Had blood work ordered, which all came back normal.  April 5 ? Played doubles tennis as usual.  Noticed some weakness in my left shoulder and arm but played through it successfully.  The pain level was very low.  April 10 ? Played doubles tennis again.  From the first ball I hit I was aware of major weakness in my shoulder and arm.  They had no power at all, and I was almost unable to get my serve over the net.  I played through it again and played very poorly.  The interesting thing was that the pain and weakness did not worsen during the play or afterwards.  The pain remained after I had finished playing.  April 11 ? Chatted with the athletic trainer while I was officiating their women?s tennis match to look for clues as to what might be wrong.  He suggested in may be a shoulder impingement.  April 15 ? Had a phone consult with my primary care doctor.  I suggested the possibility of the shoulder impingement and he was willing to start there since this was a phone visit.  He referred me to orthopedics and physical therapy and prescribed meloxicam for pain.  The pain has continued unabated during this time.  April 21 ? Pain level was very high to the point where I was unable to work.  Went home and slept most of the day.  Meloxicam was not having much impact on the pain compared to my usual regimen of both acetaminophen and ibuprofen (which I had stopped using when I was taking the meloxicam).  After this I stopped the meloxicam and went back to the other drugs as required.  I had an initial visit with the physical therapist that afternoon.  She did not find anything which would suggest a rotator cuff or labrum injury.  Range of motion was normal.  She noted weakness in my left side compared to my right, which is unusual since I am left-handed.  She gave me three exercises to do daily.  April 23 ? Pain had been back to a more tolerable level.  I had a COVID test in the morning for a treadmill test I have next week, and also got an x-ray of my shoulder as requested by my primary care doctor.  After I went to bed, I had an incident of severe incident of chills which left me freezing and short of breath even with sweats on under my bed covers.  I called my wife in to check my vitals.  My blood pressure was a bit higher than normal but not critical.  My blood oxygen was 98 and my pulse was 70.  My temperature was 99.7 with an oral thermometer.  We called the after-hours nurse hotline and spoke with a nurse.  By that time, it had been about 30 minutes of chills and they were subsiding.  She said she would have a doctor call in the next couple of hours.  The doctor called back, and after going over everything, said to come in if the symptoms reoccurred.  Thankfully they did not.  All the while I am still having the pain in my left shoulder and arm.  April 24 ? Again, slept most of the day due to being worn out from the previous night issues and lack of sleep.  No change in the pain and discomfort.

                                                In the evening of 25-Jan-2021, after my dinner I was watching the TV that after 15 minutes my Left arm from shoulder downwards felt suddenly numb with no sensation. I called my wife and sensing that it may be a stroke took 4 tablets of 81 mg of Baby Aspirin. Some sensation seem to come back after some time (may be an hour or so afterwards), but half of my left palm and little finger remained some what numb. Night passed quietly and kids were anxious that I did not call ambulance or go to ER. Next morning I went to the nearest ER and was diagnosed with Transient Ischemic Attack. All the tests were negative CT scan of Head &amp; Trunk did not reveal anything, only D-Dimer was slightly elevated. I was given a tablet of Aspirin 325 mg and prescribed Eliquis 2.5 mg twice daily for use and advised to follow up with a Neurologist. ER did advise for admission in hospital and a MRI work up, but I declined.

Altered sensation was bilateral and described as his tongue and lips felt heavy and swollen. Did not see any swelling, however. Had difficulty talking, eating and drinking and compared it to having the face numb after having dental work done. This altered sensation resolved by the next day and pt. reports back to 100% of normal. He has always had tinnitus but states his ears have been ringing a lot more since his first Covid vaccine.

Discomfort lasted 3 -4 days  About 7 days after injection a very itchy rash developed on my left arm, chest, and right arm. The rash are small, prickly red spots that cover most of the area on my arms and upper chest.  It is so itchy that I broke the skin while scratching in my sleep. I googled the condition and find that my symptoms do not match most others as it is not localized at the injection site.

                                                Had a little bit more than normal soreness in the shoulder, felt like bruising.  The day after the injection started getting flu symptoms, fairly severe, fever, coughing, runny nose, no energy at all.  Felt like he had a the worst case of flu he ever had.  He is getting better, but still has some of the symptoms.  The only thing he has taken for it is Nyquil and took a Sinutab.   Did have nausea, diarrhea, everything that comes with the flu.  Sinuses are drying up, energy is coming back and able to eat again.  He did call his doctor and he recommended that he call us and report this event.  He did have to postpone a procedure that he was scheduled for on Monday.

When I finally opened them everything looked crystallized, I couldn?t see the tv which was on but it was brighter in that area, I couldn?t make out anything. I closed my eyes for a few minutes and opened them with the same results. I closed my eyes about 4 times and then finally I could make out everything .  The only thing different that I took was the vaccine and a packet of Thera Flu.    Nothing else has happened since except a sore arm which lasted 4 days

Sunday it was feeling better so I shoveled snow and exercised and it Monday and Tuesday and it felt like frozen shoulder. So I rested it and it was still hurting pretty bad, so I started doing exercises for frozen shoulder. Its hard to comfortable lying down and sleeping.

I have spoke to my doctor on the phone  Monday evening 02/08/2021, doctor said to drink fluids and take ibuprofen and it will probably go away.

                                                Spouse woke at 3am got up for a drink of water and fainted - fell on a tile floor damaging lips and teeth.  I got up to help, cleaning up blood and checking injury.  After a while I got dizzy and fainted, got up too soon and fainted again.  I fainted a third time, had convulsions and lost bladder control.    Visited my PCP a week later.  Now have a neurologist appt scheduled, a month out.  Currently, I have no apparent issues.

I got to the bath threw up &amp; kept dry heaving. Sitting on the floor, I phoned Hospital,  and spoke with an ER nurse.  I reported my vaccine, my symptoms and told her I could not drive the 1 mile to the ER.  She indicated these may be some of the serious side effects of the Moderna Vaccine.  At 6am I crawled back to my bed &amp; woke at 9:30 am.  I called store &amp; spoke to the pharmacist who vaccinated me.  He concurs w/the ER nurse.  I am still very weak, still slightly dizzy, and very concerned.  I am a healthy 67 year old, lives by himself &amp; this episode frightened me.

Began experiencing steady pain and stiffness in left shoulder injection site within an hour of injection and continued throughout rest of day, night and next day (2/25/21).  Began feeling run down and sore in back, neck and right shoulder at bed time (12:30 AM 2/25/21).  Had difficulty sleeping all night due to musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by pre-existing anxiety (which I took 50 MG of Sertraline for during the night).  Very lethargic when woke up on morning of 2/25/21 and had slight fever.  Laid in bed for 2-3 hours after woke up; did not get up until 12:30 PM due to no energy.  Not nauseated, but have no appetite.

                                                One week post injection, on February 18, I developed  chills and a fever starting around 9 PM. I experienced diarrhea starting around 10 PM. Fever was approx 100.4 F and was accompanied by a splitting headache and significant body aches, to the point where I was unable to get any sleep that night. I noticed Covid arm the next morning. Fever, headache and body aches continued until Monday morning. I took only Extra Strength Tylenol. Most of the time Tylenol was effective only for the first 2-3 hrs before the discomfort overcame it. I was tested twice for COVID, both Friday AM and Monday AM. Both came back negative. Starting Monday the body aches and fever began to subside but I was left with a feeling of exhaustion and required continuous sleep.  Today is the first day I feel back to normal. I still have a large Covid arm rash, two weeks post injection. It causes no discomfort whatsoever.

He wasn&#39;t able to speak for 3 days.  On 2/17/2021 he went to the hospital.  They thought he may have Bell&#39;s Palsy so the they did a XRAY and CT.  They were not able to find anything other than facial swelling so he was discharged and told to come back if he did not get better and they would make him an appt w/ an ENT.  He started taking Aleve.  He no longer has constant pain but his mouth still hurts when he opens it.  He will contact his PCP to let her know what happened and to let her know that he will not be taking his 2nd covid vax dose.

Per wife - patient became clammy, very warm, unresponsive, gurgling at the mouth. I ran out to check on patient Pharm.D.  They asked if they could remove his mask , i told them YES! he had a cloth mask over an n95 mask! Upon inspection, patient was not talking to me like he was prior to vaccine. They said patient gets tired and can become out of it, so they were not sure if this was a rxn to vaccine or just one of his episodes.  Patient has prior hx of 3 times stroke and is on dialysis. He did not appear to be in anaphylaxis and was breathing (when looking at chest). We called code white to pharmacy, and  Manager called EMS 5:44pm. Pharm.D came out to assist me 5:45pm. It was difficult to get a pulse using fingers, so we used BP cuff and got 83/57, with 87 BPM 547pm. I had epi pen ready to go in case we needed to use it but wanted to wait since patient was still breathing. While waiting for EMS, patient became responsive and began to talk. EMS showed up and took over. At this time Patient was talking and joking. 550 pm We decided we wanted patient to be checked out prior to sending him on his way. EMS asked us what we had done, and we discussed the above. EMS took over from there 555pm. Everything turned out ok, EMS left without further intervention. Before they left, I went to speak to family, and they were very happy due to the care they received. Event ending @ 6:15pm

Days  later muscle inflammation  throughout my arm  progressively worst  accompanied by occasional tingling  in the fingers,  After the second week  I had a virtual  office visit with  my PPC doctor who said  this was a common side effect and so I just let it take its  course.  After my second shot  (2/15/) the same  feelings have occurred but  even more acute.  Keeping me awake at night etc.

                                                Narrative:  67 year-old male received his 1st COVID vaccine dose at a clinic on 2/25/21 at ~ 11:45am. No known prior COVID infection.

Patient reported previously daily use of diphenhydramine (2 caps every morning) and kept an epi-pen on hand. The afternoon of 2/26/21, patient presented to his neighbor&#39;s house requesting assistance with an epi-pen. Neighbor reported significant swelling around tongue and lips, and ability to faintly speak. Neighbor administered epi-pen, but unsure if it worked, so administered a 2nd epi-pen.

Evaluation of oral cavity showed significant swelling of tongue. Additional dose of epinephrine given. Patient remained with no palpable central pulse and showed continued evidence of PEA. Patient was estimated to have been down &gt; 45 minutes. Patient pronounced deceased at 4:59pm.

                                                Nothing at all for 14 hours...not even a sore arm. Around eleven that evening, severe headache; nausea; muscle aches arms &amp; legs; and most serious two seizures (spasms??) about 5 seconds apart.  I?ve only had a few muscle cramps in my life so the seizures were unusual to say the least. They started in my lower abdomen (seemed like a small band going full circle around my body) and moved incrementally up towards my shoulders.  Rapid movement upward...kinda like squeezing a tube of toothpaste. Each one was only about two seconds long but fairly violent. If I had anything in stomach, it would have been on the floor.  Everything was gone (except the sore shoulder) by five in the morning.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 vaccine EUA. Rash, burning sensation, and itching begins at bottom of feet and then moves up to the upper torso. Have been taking Benadryl to provide relief from the burning and itching. Began approximately at 9 PM of Friday 3/5. If I do not take the Benadryl the rash, burning, and itching spreads from bottom of feet to the upper torso within 15 to 20 minutes.

                                                ?I recd the first moderna vaccine 2-13-2021 at 11 AM.  Headache, right side only, started same day at 7:30 PM, sore shoulder at vaccine site about 10:30 PM same day.  Both were gone the next morning.  I recd the second dose of the moderna vaccine 3-13-2021 at 11 AM.  By 2 PM I had a ranging head ache, again right side only.  I drove four hours to the vaccination site, hospital.  I was driving home when this started.  I stopped to purchase Tylenol about 3 pm which it turns out had no effect.  I was driving west into a setting sun, as the headache got worse, my eyes became more and more sensitive to the sun, I stopped a second time to purchase a second pair of sunglasses that I could wear over the first pair, that didn?t help, I ended up stopping at a rest area until the sun set.  I got to my house at about 6 PM, by then I could no longer wear my prescription glasses, besides the headache I was now very dizzy.  At about 9 PM the pain started, between my shoulder blades first, never at the injection site.  From that time on, including today, the pain has constantly moved around my body, the worst pain is associated with areas that arthritis affects me, hips, knees, hands, ankles.  I have had a mild fever, ranging from 100.9 Saturday night to 100.3 now at11 AM 3-15-2021.  Yesterday, 3-14, my head was swearing, my feet were ice cold.  I had an electric blanket from my waist down and an ice pack on head.  If I have ever felt worse in my life I don?t remember when that would have been.  The pain has moderated today, I expect the worst is now over.    If as the health specialists are suggesting a booster will be required this fall I will undoubtedly have incredibly significant reservations with this vaccine.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

                                                Several hours after injection  I began experiencing severe and extreme muscle and joint pain in head, neck, and left shoulder and arm.  Further into the evening and past midnight I started experiencing shortness of breath and extreme headache pain above the eyes. Extremely Sharp pain in the right arm and shoulder, felt like my arm was being aggressively yanked.  I then became panicky and decided to call a 24 Hour nurse service and describe what I was experiencing.  After spending 20 minute on the phone with the nurse she concluded that an emergency room visit was necessary but that I should contact my doctor at the beginning of the next business day.  The pain still exists.

                                                Pain in left leg that started in hip and knee.  Felt like minor muscle strain from more than normal physical activity (pain maybe 1 to 2).  Over the next two days what appeared to be muscle pain increased from minor to a more moderate muscle strain (pain maybe 2 to 3) and pain started to move to the shin - Tibia with more pronounced pain in the shin (pain 3 to 4).  Night of the third day woke up with serious pain in the shin - front of Tibia (pain 8 - constant pain, could not be relieved by massage or change of position, breathing became involuntary with heavy exhale, occasional involuntary moan when change of pressure or position).  Pain was relieved somewhat with over the counter pain med.  Pain has been 24/7 since then for almost 3 weeks.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

                                                seizure; sore arm; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning a 67-years old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced seizure and sore arm.  The patient&#39;s medical history included brain tumor removed. No relevant concomitant product was reported.  On 06 Ma 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 036A21A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On the same day patient experienced sore arm for couple of days.  On 12 Mar 2021, 6 days after the first shot, the patient experienced seizure. The patient was hospitalized for a night and laboratory tests were performed. There was no indication of stroke and everything else came back inconclusive.  No treatment information was reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the event sore arm was resolved on 08 Mar 2021 and the outcome of the event seizure was unknown; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Started having severe body aches and chilling.  Never ran a fever.  Became weak where i could barely walk.  Body aches were worsening until i had to lie down.  Went to bed around 6:30pm but tossed and turned  because of body aches.  Finally fell asleep around 10:30pm and woke up  around 9:00 am feeling like a new man.  All symptons were gone.

He went in and was seen by the physician twice.  The first time was for a CT and other blood tests to ensure he didn&#39;t have a stroke.  The second appointment was to tell him that it wasn&#39;t a stroke and nothing else was wrong, so they assumed it was the vaccine.  He also went to the eye doctor during this time to ensure that it wasn&#39;t going to affect his stigmatism due to the fact that he couldn&#39;t wear his contacts only his glasses and his stigmatism is so bad he has to wear hard contacts.  Due to the twitching he couldn&#39;t wear the contacts.  It was reported to us on 04/08/2021 and he was still have some eye twitching, but not bad and his mouth symptoms had pretty much resolved.  The physician said that it should go away in 1-2 weeks and if not he was suppose to see her one more time.

                                                I should point out that I donated a pint of blood 2 hours before getting my Moderna shot. I thought it would 27 hours before the shot but after donating the pharmacy called and said they had vaccine available if we wanted to move  up getting our shots right then 24 hours before our appointment.  8 hours later,  at 3:00am I got up to go to the bathroom. I immediately started feeling nauseous and light headed. I ended up collapsing and falling flat on my back. I immediately started shivering and shaking along with the nausea. For the next 12 hours I was extremely weak and my joints severely ached. It was very hard to move.   The total experience lasted roughly 18 hours before I started feeling significantly better.  Before donating blood I asked the if getting the Moderna Covid shot 27 hours (I thought 27 hours at that time) after donating would be a problem .  They said no. We asked the pharmacist before getting the shot if donating blood 2 hours earlier would be a problem. She thought naught and said she had no guidance against it.  I?m a very very healthy 67 year old. I rarely get sick and I have no prescriptions.  Complicating my blood donation was that my pulse was 44 beats per minute but my good health allowed them to proceed.  I?m not complaining about anyone or anything. I just thought you should be advised of my experience.

The pain persisted for another month and spread to both shoulders, both hips, and the muscles of his arms and legs. Tylenol and flexeril did not help much. He went to the ER on 3/15/21 where he received an IV fluid bolus and had his levothyroxine dose lowered a little. Since discharge from there, he then followed up in clinic on 3/23/21 where he said his pain and weakness were bad enough that he was having difficulty lifting his arms, grabbing objects especially at/above shoulder level, and holding objects in general to perform his daily activities of living. He was placed on a 2-week tapered course of prednisone on 3/23/21 and again required another 2-week course on 4/8/21 because when the prednisone wore off he was back to having pain and weakness.

Treated with Ice pack and acetaminophen so I could sleep. At 7am the same morning, arm was still very sore, slightly swollen and hot to the touch. Also experienced body aches and high  fatigue. Ended up resting and napping for the balance of the day . Today 4/11 only have a slightly sore arm at injection site and no fatigue or body aches.

                                                Besides some known symptoms like headache, chills, low energy, there was a marked increase in neuropathy pain that seemed unusual despite the medications for this condition: Lyrica 100mg during the day and 300mg at night, and Dronabinol 5mg at night that usually control the pain.  This started kicking up during the day after the shot (04/09/21) progressively getting worse during the day with full blown episodes of pain into the evening and night.  This stopped about 3:00am.  I did not think it was related to the second covid shot until the next day when I looked for kn I was symptoms of the shot and found a blog where several people had also noted this symptom.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine I experienced an extreme elevated heart rate for approximately 90 seconds. Heart rate gradually returned to normal over the next 30 seconds. I was fine afterwards and drove home.  Over the next 3 days my arm was very sore, even to a light touch and I experienced fatigue.

                                                He got the vaccine, when she gave him the shot if felt like liquid fire going in, it was then fine.  Two hours later the arm started swelling up and got so swollen he could hardly move the shoulder.  Then it started moving into the shoulder quadrant, as far as your fingers can spread, all the way back onto the back itself.  It then traveled up to the neck, to the spine to the ear in that quadrant and stops at the knot behind the ear.  The pain is so bad that you press on the knot behind the ear the headache will go away.  The headache is so intense  it feels like it&#39;s going to blow off and takes migraine headache medicine which does not help it.  It now has caused vision issues, he cannot read/blurry vision with large print things close up.  He can see fine 5&#39; or further with no problems, but nothing up close and he can&#39;t drive due to this or use the computer as he can&#39;t see the keyboard to type.  The pain has continued even up until today, 4/14/21.   The shot area is fine now.   Originally when the symptoms started he could not turn his head as it hurt so bad, and has taken all this amount of time to actually turn his head some, but cannot turn it to the left much.  He can gently and slowly turn his head but it is painful.  He has gone to his doctor and went to the COVID clinic with the first vaccine who want to see him to a neurologist.

No previous episodes. Very active, healthy exercising/running life style. some relief with self administered HCTZ and leg elevation. Very unusual, not expected, no obvious explanation.  Waxed and waned. No fever, SOB. No risk factors for DVT.  Painful due to new acute stretching of skin around ankle up to mid calf. consulted ab PMD 4/11/21, suspecting side effect of amlodipine or lisinopril, however, I&#39;ve taking these meds for years.  This is very unusual. Lab. tests are ordered.  My concern is clot.

                                                The patient had his second Moderna vaccine on 2/18/2021.  Around the same time he actually mechanically injured his knee.  On 3/8/2021 he went to a care clinic for knee pain but had also developed severe bilateral shoulder, bilateral hand and hip girdle pain with stiffness a few days after receiving the vaccine.  At the time he was told that this pain was likely related to compensating for his knee pain.  He then presented to see me (primary care provider) in my office after having the knee repaired on 4/5/2021.  Reported he was able to bear weight and walk as usual on his knee but was not seeing any improvement in his shoulder, hand and hip girdle pain and stiffness.  Ultimately was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica, started on prednisone and referred to rheumatology.

                                                5 days after the 2nd dose of moderna vaccine my husband started shaking severely, his whole body, stating he was freezing and he had trouble walking, he wobbled to his recliner. I covered him with several heavy blankets and he continued to shake in episodes of 10 - 15 seconds, then it would stop for 10 -15 seconds and start again. I tested his blood sugar which was 80. He did not have a temperature. This shaking continued for about 1 hour before slowly subsiding and gradually fading away. He then slept for 2 hours.  He  awoke the next morning with a moderate headache and a temp of 99.5 and felt achy all over. I gave him 2 extra strength tylenol and left for work. At 10:30 am his temp was still the same he took more tylenol. I called his physician, a nd reported his symptoms to the nurse. The doctor felt it was a reaction to the vaccine and recommended rest, fluids and tylenol.

Friday evening he felt better and was oddly animated and somewhat manic.  Early Saturday morning the symptoms returned and lasted through Monday afternoon, then the manic behavior set in again along with a sense that he was better.  He wasn&#39;t; by bed time Monday he was down again.  Same for Tuesday.  Saw the doctor Tuesday at noon, was prescribed an anti-nausea medication and submitted to blood work that found nothing abnormal.  This is Tuesday evening and he is still not feeling right, day 6 of symptoms.   I have never seen him so sick and miserable and weak.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.       Concurrent medical conditions included Heart transplant (0.58 years from treatment for COVID-19) and Cardiomyopathy (Cause for heart transplant was Nonischemic cardiomyopathy). Concomitant products included TACROLIMUS, MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL and PREDNISONE for Immunosuppression.    On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced COVID-19 (covid-19 infection) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), HYPOXIA (hypoxia) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), LUNG INFILTRATION (Bilateral lung infiltrate) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), COUGH (Cough) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), ASTHENIA (weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), CHILLS (Chills) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and VACCINE BREAKTHROUGH INFECTION (Covid-19 infection 19 days after COVID-19 vaccine). The patient was hospitalized for 5 days due to ASTHENIA, CHILLS, COUGH, COVID-19, HYPOXIA and LUNG INFILTRATION. At the time of the report, COVID-19 (covid-19 infection), HYPOXIA (hypoxia), LUNG INFILTRATION (Bilateral lung infiltrate), COUGH (Cough), ASTHENIA (weakness) and CHILLS (Chills) outcome was unknown and VACCINE BREAKTHROUGH INFECTION (Covid-19 infection 19 days after COVID-19 vaccine) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Blood creatinine: &gt;0.3 mg/dl milligram per decilitre (abnormal) &gt;0.3 mg/dl. On an unknown date, Lymphopenia: &lt;900/mcl (abnormal) &lt;900/mcL. On an unknown date, Oxygen saturation: &lt;92% (abnormal) Hypoxia. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: negative (Negative) Negative.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patients were comparable to those of solid organ transplant patients (SOTs) who had COVID-19 infection and have not been vaccinated. Antinucleocapside antibody at COVID-19 diagnosis was also negative. Treatment for COVID-19 was with Remdesivir and Convalescent Plasma. Patient was discharged on 2 liters of oxygen.  Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The date of vaccine administration, onset date for the events and the date for the antibody test are required for further evaluation. Based on the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. However, immunocompromised state in solid organ transplant patients may remain as risk factors for reduced immune response and infection.

When I came to, my speech was slurred for a few minutes and my blood pressure was very low.  The EMT&#39;s arrived, took my blood pressure, reported it was 85 / 58.  After a few minutes, drinking some fluids, I began to feel more normal.  I declined to go with the EMT&#39;s.  That afternoon, I was extremely tired and slept most of the afternoon.

                                                On Saturday, May 15, while sitting with his wife, &#34;froze&#34; for a short period of time, approximately 1-2 minutes. His wife did not know what was wrong and urged him to go to the hospital. His son brought him to the hospital, he presented with elevated blood pressure, a slightly asymmetric smile, and black tongue. He was admitted to the hospital and multiple tests (brain scans, electrocardiogram, etc.) were run to try to diagnose what had occurred. On the afternoon of Sunday, May 16, in the midst of being discharged from the hospital, pt had another &#34;episode&#34; which was later categorized by physicians as being a partial complex seizure, where he &#34;froze&#34; and became unresponsive for approximately 1 minute. During the event, he was wearing a heart monitor, which showed no unusual heart activity, but his blood oxygen level dropped during the event. On Sunday, May 16, pt had a second partial complex seizure (third seizure over the 2-day period). This seizure was timed at being approximately one minute in duration. Following the seizures on 5/16, patient was given Ativan and also a 1500mg loading dose of Keppra. On Monday, May 17, patient had a EEG administered, which indicated that there was no unusual activity occurring in the brain during the test. He was advised to continuing taking Keppra at 750mg/day. Pt does not have a family history of epilepsy, never played contact sports, and has not suffered brain injuries such as a concussion.

I started having chills. I have a fever, still with aches and pains. The soreness at the injection site is about gone. Yesterday, 01.03.21, I was running a fever between 99-101 all night long. Last night I took one Tylenol to help slow it down a little. It&#39;s been pretty severe up until now. Right now my temp is 98.1.  I did not go to the ER and my wife has the lot number in her purse with her right now.

Staff lowered patient to floor and started CPR. EMS was called and continued CPR at scene, however they were not able to revive patient. Patient was pronounced dead at the scene. Staff written statements following the death of patient show that he had a fall about 1 hr. prior. It is unknown if this fall contributed to patient&#39;s death. An autopsy has been requested.

There is no facial drooping.  Mostly in left side of face and a bit in back teeth on that side also.  A bit annoying and noticeable to me, but not painful or affecting my ability to think or do things.  I have had this feeling a bit in the past, but never sought medical attention for it as it went away.

                                                Felt fine after injection, walked 5 miles home &amp; assured loved ones before going to bed that vaccination went fine with no side effects. After midnight I woke in the dark with many of the same symptoms as when I had COVID in March/April 2020: extreme allover body aches, terrible thirst, extreme weakness.  Next day (Wednesday) symptoms continued; too weak &amp; achy to watch all but the core parts of the inauguration; too uncomfortable to read or to concentrate on music or anything else.  Absolutely no appetite so I didn&#39;t eat.  Wednesday night I tossed &amp; turned all night with a chill that I couldn&#39;t lose even with the heaviest down comforter &amp; supplementary blankets.  That night &amp; the following day I also noticed a distorted sense of time, where hours seem to pass v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y.  On Thursday night two more symptoms appeared: a tremendous cough that I couldn&#39;t stop or assuage with the normal remedies (e.g., lozenges, tea with honey), and that kept me from falling asleep till dawn; and diarrhea (which was limited because I hadn&#39;t eaten since Monday dinner so I didn&#39;t have much food in my system).  The cough felt like it might develop into a sore throat (which had been my first symptom when I had COVID) but it never did.  Yesterday (Friday) I felt as if my symptoms (other than residual weakness) were abating, and Friday night I got a full night of unbroken sleep.  I awoke on Saturday morning with no symptoms, and felt well enough to challenge myself by attempting my usual 90-minute yoga/stretch workout, which proved to be no problem.  Now, at 4 pm on Saturday--about 100 hours after my shot--I feel fairly normal &amp; seem to have no further symptoms.  I do plan to lie low &amp; take things easy, and to have as little outside contact as possible between now and my second shot (scheduled for 2/16) in order to minimize the possibility of re-infection.

                                                This is to report my reaction to the Covid19 vaccination. Yesterday, January 26, 2021, I took the Covid19 vaccination at 2:50 pm. Around 10:00 pm I started to feel soreness running up my arm to my shoulder and down to my forearm from the injection site. All night, the pain kept getting worse. By 3:00 am the pain reached a level 8 with any movement jumping to an intolerable level 10, the worst pain I&#39;ve ever experienced from any vaccination I&#39;ve ever have taken. Needless to say, I was in pain all night. I have no other symptoms at this time. Should I be concerned?

My wife had to help me get out of the recliner and get dressed for our trip. Also I was very confused. I was a bit nauseous and did not want to eat.  My blood sugar was 226.  For the next 6 hours as we traveled, I had to pee every 30-45 minutes. I needed help getting in and out of the rest stops and the vehicle.  As we traveled I mostly slept. I did drink a little diet soda, but did not eat.  After the 6 hours of travel I felt a stronger and was able to get out of the car and into the houses by myself.  For the next 24 hours I felt week, ate very little and sugers ran high.

                                                Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine EUA The day following the vaccine I had a fever,  headache, significantly higher than normal blood pressure, increased heart rate, chills/sweats intermittent throughout the next 24 hours.  Very much like a severe case of the flu. They subsided somewhat today, but to the loss of being able to sleep pretty weak today.

                                                Neck pain near the top of the neck at the base of the skull slightly to the right of the center began around Feb 1. Began taking Ibuprofin, but it did not go away.  Thought I had muscle strain, but surprisingly there was no stiffness or loss of motion. Tried massage, heat, and cold packs with limited relief. Began interfering with sleep over the next few days. On the evening of Feb 4, I noticed a strange sensation on the right side of my tongue as if I was losing taste or feeling there. At 3 AM got out o bed due to neck pain and noticed right eye felt strange and was drooping. When I got up at 8 AM I saw eye droop and smile was only on one side of mouth. Called my doctor and was directed to an advice nurse who told me to go to the ER right away, since this could be a stroke or Bell&#39;s Palsy. Went to ER and was diagnosed as Bell&#39;s Palsy after blood tests, EKG, CT scan, and tests of limbs. Given medications and and released with prescriptions sent to CVS for prednisone and valacyclovir.

Head spinning, very weak limbs, barely able to get out of bed and stand after extreme effort, no arm strength, could only move to the bathroom via baby steps with while holding on to whatever was available to steady myself.  I ended up on the floor and was barely able to get up and back into bed after considerable effort.  My arms and legs were like rubber.  I had fever and severe night sweats.  I was virtually unable to function.  This lasted from the night of 02/03 and continued through 02/04.  Finally 02/05 I was able to get out of bed and shakily stand. But I couldn&#39;t stay up long, as I had the aches and pains and a headache still.  Finally 02/06 I was able to get out of bed and stay out.  I hope my description describes the magnitude of my symptoms.  I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to survive.

I slept 14, 12 and 18 hours per day the first 3 days after vaccination. I have been improving each day but still tire easily and still have a cough when taking deep inhalations (as of Feb. 10).

Feb 3 about 13.5 hrs after second dose Moderna (3 AM), I showed no symptoms from getting shot at 1:30 pm Feb 2 until going to bed, but at 3 AM woke due to significant headache and arm soreness.  Laid there about an hour until I got our of bed at 4 AM, got Tylenol from hall closet and went in bathroom to take Tylenol.  I was fine until I tried to open Tylenol, and suddenly started sweating, dizzy, feeling faint.  Managed to get to floor with my wife&#39;s assistance, lay for awhile but couldn&#39;t get up to walk so crawled back to bed.  Had severe chills for over an hour until fell asleep.  Spend next 36 hours in bed due to headache and dizziness, very fatigued napping off and on, but chills never returned.  By evening of Feb 4 I felt stable enough to walk around the house and eat dinner meal at dining table.  Saturday, Feb 5 stayed home fatigued napping off and on.  By Sunday morning Feb 6 I felt good enough to play a round of golf without incident and felt 100% recovered by Sunday afternoon

Had headache, body aches, nerve pains. Everything from the belt upwards hurts. Today he can walk better but still has to hold on to things.

                                                I started feeling fatigued on Sunday Feb 14. I started feeling this way in the afternoon. Next I felt like I had indigestion so I took some tums. At about 1:00am on Monday morning I woke up and felt really bad and thought I had indigestion so I tried to take some more tums and vomited. I was really weak and short of breath. I laid back down and tried to go to sleep but my heart felt like it was racing. Within an hour I was back up vomiting again with shortness of breath, weakness, heart racing. I tried to lay back down but within another hour I vomited again. This went on until 8:30am Monday morning. My pulse was everywhere. 97 to 112bpm. I was having chills all day and weak. I slept a lot Monday and also had diarrhea on Monday morning. I couldn&#39;t eat all of Monday and finally ate some soup on Tuesday. I am feeling much better today but still a little fatigued.

                                                My injected arm was quite sore during day 2 - I could not sleep on that side that night.  It was much better the next day and soreness gone by day 4.  On 2-15-2021 I developed a rash very similar to Hives over approximately 10% of my upper torso between my waist and neck.  Was very itchy so I applied an itch stopping cream which eliminated most of the itching.  By the next morning some much reduced rash remained but virtually no itching.  As I write this at 9 PM 2-16-2021 the rash is still evident.

Total body aches, loss of appetite and loss of energy for next 60 hours. I felt ok on 01/27/2021 but beginning 01/28/2021 I had a debilitating headache and concurrent loss of energy that persisted for next 72 hours until 01/31/2021 when I finally felt better.

He then had a syncope episode where he was unresponsive for  15 to 20 seconds and then became responsive. It took him 15 to 20 minutes to recover and regain balance to stand up and walk. He rested with his head down as he was nauseas and tired from the event. He stood up once he was able and alert.

                                                Patient Statement:  No symptoms until the following morning at about 7:30am when I noticed mild discomfort and subsequently measured my heart rate via iWatch.  The results indicated tachycarida, with rates raning from about 54 to 173 BPM,  The rate would rise slowly to different peaks, remaining at that level for 1 to 3 mins, then return slowly to normal, the periods of change being in the 1 to 3 minute range.  When running a ECG via my iWatch the Sinus Rhythm appeared abnormal only in period, showing changing rates mirroring what my BPM showed.  The distress was more psychological than physiological, feeling about the same as when our grade school PE teacher would make us run every day.  I hated running, as the breathing burned my lungs and gave me discomfort, but I&#39;m sure it was the same for all of us.  I have no allergies, have never had Influenza, was never absent a single day from school for sickness from Kindergarten all the way through 4 years of college.  I had a cardio work-up a few years ago that showed nothing abnormal, and a health screening about 2 years ago for deep vein and extremity circulation without nominal results.  I&#39;ve been nearly vegan for several years, and have lost around 30 lbs within the last year, approaching a BMI withing normal range.  I do have a slightly elevated BP, but that is reducing with weight loss.  I have had kidney stones since about 1996, but they tend to pass withing a few hours.  Nothing else to report.

It was very tender to the touch and hurt to bend or grasp objects. Today is the 28th, 6 days after injection and it seems to be getting better.

                                                Approximately 11 hours post-injection, general tiredness crept over me.  Decided to call it a night early and before I could get in bed, the chills and shaking began.  This continued for approximately 4 hours.  I was thirsty and struggled to get up and get water, as I was getting weak and unsure of my stance.  No fever, but headache and general joint aching began around midnight.  Sleep was practically nonexistent.  Got out of bed around 7 a.m. to eat and take acetaminophen for headache.  Also prepared and started pushing electrolyte sports fluids (drink tabs).  Ate a piece of toast with jelly and could not taste it.  Had lost my sense of taste.  Went back to bed for my first of 2 morning naps.  After my second nap, approximately 11:00 a.m., most of the symptoms had abated although I was still weak.  Had oatmeal with protein powder (standard breakfast for me) and more electrolytes.  Recovery was rapid and by 3:00 p.m., all symptoms except loss of taste had resolved.  Taste finally return the next day.

Pain subsided for almost a week then returned.  Same pain, same site and more.  Spasms in adjacent muscles.  Up neck, down arm, pecs and lats near area.  Hard to sleep.  Pain will wake me up at night.  Trying to take it easy, stretch it out.  Some relief after stretching  for awhile and increase range of motion for awhile.  no treatment yet.  Have used analgesics a little with little success.  So it&#39;s been 3 weeks and a day and I&#39;m still dealing with this.

                                                Blood Clot in Leg; Tenderness; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 68-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced blood clot in leg and tenderness.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not  provided by the reporter. Concomitant medications reported included diltiazem hydrochloride, atorvastatin calcium and acetyl salicylic acid.  On 13-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:031M2QA) through intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13-Feb-2021, following administration of the vaccine, the patient had tenderness in his leg that continued until he sought out medical treatment. After medical treatment is was concluded that the patient has a blood clot in his leg and has to receive medical treatment to resolve that condition. The treatment information included rivaroxaban.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The events, blood clot in leg and tenderness were considered recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: There is not enough information to assess the causa association between the reported event of blood clot in leg and the administration if the mRNA-1273 vaccine.  Critical details such as the patient&#39;s medical history is lacking. Additional information has been requested.  Howe ever, based on temporal association between product administration and the event of tenderness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Second vaccination was on Wednesday April 14 at 12:34. The following morning at 5:00am I began to have extreme chills, muscle pain all day. When I would get warm from the chills then I would get overheated. This was on Thursday. Thursday night I sweated so bad that I went through four t-shirts and 4 pillow cases. This morning (Friday) the muscle pain has gone as has the chills. I woke up congested, still getting got easily and extremely tired.

He was given his second Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on 03/10/21. Per note on 3/12, pt had seizure like symptoms at 0545 for approx. 45 seconds (eye rolling, lack of response, increased confusion)  Per staff, there was no flexing of limbs or loss of bowel or bladder control.  No noted stroke like symptoms but he appeared more confused at neuro check.  Pt was back to baseline at 15 min neuro check.  Pt reported to have had additional seizure, of approx. 4 minutes duration, during morning report that day-but when MD got to his room, he appeared ?post ictal with a mildly agitated restless delirium? rolling back and forth on the floor, moaning, and not making eye contact.  Pt did lose control of his bladder. Olanzapine was discontinued on 3/12, due to potential to lower the seizure threshold.  Divalproex was initiated for seizures.  Per note 3/22-no additional seizure type symptoms have occurred.

The pain varied between a constant ache to sharp  pains and a burning sensation in my wrist.  It is difficult and painful to do simple tasks like opening bottles and doors. Pain is constant. About two weeks after the second dose the same symptoms appeared in my right hand and wrist. All symptoms still exhibit themselves in both hands and wrists.

                                                After 4-5 hours of the 2nd dose of Moderna I start to get pain in the arms and legs, feel weir at night time like light headache, dizziness and uncomfortable in breathing that wake me up at the middle of the night. Blood pressure elevated higher than normal. After a week the arm&#39;s pain getting better,but the legs&#39; pain gets worse. Since then my legs pain and join pain getting worse and worse, its hurts with activities and no pain at rest while seat or lay down. I&#39;ve been through many doctors visits including the Urgent Care, ER, Neurology and rheumatology doctors and had many kinds of testing and found nothing wrong with my heart, lung, blood clots in the legs, Both of my legs are just progressively getting worse,both legs are getting more pain and weaker, that make me hard to lift them up for walking. I almost can&#39;t work now. I also feel so tired, dizzy and headache for 2-3 days each time that come and go since the 2nd dose of the vaccine. I&#39;ll have the MRI tests on 06/05/2021 and 06/06/2021.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                During both Friday and especially Saturday, I felt &#34;wrong&#34; physically, very low energy, constipated, and wanting to just lie down and sleep. I must have slept at least 3 times my usual 6hrs/night both days. Also Friday and increasingly Saturday,  the injection site got much more swollen, hot and stiff than any other vaccination I have ever had. I wish I had been warned of this probability, I need to sleep on that arm due to reflux issues. Sunday morning I awoke with all health and energy back to normal. I will be sure to get my (reluctant) 2nd shot in the other arm.

Felt flush and fatigued through the early morning, took his temp this a.m. at 0930 and reported temp ranging to 100.4 F  Pt states that his usual baseline body temp is 97.  Pt states aside from a bit of fatigue he is otherwise without symptoms.  He works part time as a mental health counselor.  Pt was screened for COVID 19 and as well for influenza, those test results are pending at the time of this submission.  I did discuss with the patient that a bit of fever following receiving vaccines is not an uncommon side effect.  I did also encourage the patient to participate in the V-Safe registry program.

                                                69 YO M CARDIAC ARREST. PT HAD JUST RECEIVED HIS COVID VACCINATION AND WAS PULLING INTO THE OBSERVATION AREA WHEN HE LOST CONTROL OF HIS TRUCK, BECAME UNCONSCIOUS AND CRASHED INTO A LIGHT POLE. THIS OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THE STANDBY MEDIC UNIT AND OTHER FIRE DEPT STAFF. PT WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE IN CARDIAC ARREST. CPR WAS INITIATED WITHIN SECONDS OF BEING REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE. EMS WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DEFIBRILLATED FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SINE WAVE VT/COURSE VF WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF HIS ARREST. PT WAS PLACED ONTO A BACK BOARD AND MOVED TO AMBULANCE IN A PULSED VT AND WAS AWAKE AND RESPONSIVE. ONCE IN THE BACK THE PT WAS WIRED INTO THE FOUR LEAD AND WAS SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERTED AT 100 J WITH A CONVERSION TO A PULSED JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM WITH A RATE OF ABOUT 58. THIS RHYTHM CHANGED INTO A SINUS TACH AT ABOUT 100 BPM. IV ACCESS WAS OBTAINED AND 100 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS ADMINISTERED WITH A 2:1 LIDO DRIP HUNG. AMBULANCE BEGAN TRANSPORT TO ER. OVER NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES PT BEGAN HAVING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY IN THE FORM OF PVCs COUPLETS AND EVENTUALLY 4-5 BEAT RUNS OF VTACH WHILE ON PHONE WITH ER MD. DISCUSSED GIVING ANOTHER BOLUS OF LIDO AND INCREASING DRIP TO 3:1 DUE TO INCREASING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY. THE ER PHYSICIAN CONCURRED AND ANOTHER 75 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS GIVEN FOLLOWED BY INCREASING THE DRIP RATE TO 3MG/MINUTE FOLLOWING THE SECOND LIDO DOSE AND DRIP ADJUSTMENT THE PATIENT&#39;S VENTRICULAR ECTOPY RESOLVED AND THE PATIENT REMAINED IN A SINUS RHYTHM / SLOW SINUS TACH THROUGHOUT TRANSPORT AND TRANSFER OF CARE TO THE ER. A 12 LEAD WAS OBTAINED JUST PRIOR TO ARRIVAL IN ED THAT SHOWED SINUS TACH WITHOUT VENTRICULAR ECTOPY BUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE PACs, FLIPPED T WAVES IN a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

                                                I went to my doctor yesterday  because my left calf muscle had acute pain.  He did an ultrasound to verify that it was not the result of a blood clot which was negative;  so he gave me pain pills and instructions to use hot/cold compresses.  After getting out of a tub of warm water I noticed blotches of redness (rash) above my right knee which had already begun to swell.  I also noticed that my right calf muscled is beginning to be sore and a rash was developing on my arm below my elbow.

It hurt all night and still is hurting today. It is hurting about 4 inches from where they gave me shot. From my elbow down to my fingertips feels cold. I have coronary artery disease which means when my arm gets cold like that it means I have a blood flow issue. I have two stints and I have triple bypass surgery. The pain is constant pain in the upper arm.    I sent an email over to my primary care doctor yesterday. I was advised by Oncologist advised me to get the vaccine.

I got things under control by increasing the TEGRETOL dosage and adding gabapentin.  BP 125/75 P69 T99.0.  I have controlled this disease for 20 years and I never have had an event like this. I can only assume the inflammatory component of the reaction to the vaccine activated the neuralgia.

                                                achy upon waking up on 2/13 (approx 7a).  At laundromat, started to get clammy, and sweaty.  Sat down, and next thing I knew I has fainted (approx 7:45-8a).  Police were called, then First Aid Squad.  Very pale, sweaty and nauseous (threw up 2x).  Went to Hospital.  Was evaluated in the ED for approx 6 hrs, then transferred to a room for overnight observation.

Extreme dizziness (actually causing me to fall even when walking a few feet), extreme nausea (I think probably caused by the extreme dizziness), weakness, profound diaphoresis.  I was sick like I have never been in my life,  thought I might die, and when I was the most symptomatic actually wanted to die, I was so sick. Anyway, came on over about a 10 minute period gradually, and then was absolutely profoundly ill  for about 45 minutes. After about 1/2 hour or so was able to negotiate the 25 feet or so to my den couch, closed my eyes and lied down, with gradual relief coming and severe illness totally gone in about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. No return of any similar episode since. 24 hours later, still a little lethargic and mildly &#34;achey&#34; with some weakness, but not so bad and kind of what I was expecting.

Improved that evening. The next morning symptoms of slight weakness only. Did not take any more medication other than regular daily meds.

                                                Extreme dizziness during the night, weakness and headache (took Tylenol 650 MG  for headache). Around 6 AM got out of bed to use toilet.  Wife heard a loud crash and found me in bathtub.  I don&#39;t recall falling but shower curtain fell down and have minor neck and back discomfort at this time.  Wife assisted me to crawl out of tub and she reported I &#34;passed out&#34; two more times for short durations as I crawled back into bed. Had profuse cold sweating episode for about 15 minutes.  Much less weakness now at 10 am, no dizziness but still a mild headache.

                                                Patient and wife called in to report patient experiencing 7/10 constant stomach pain, uncontrollable shaking, and numbness and tingling bilateral feet. Patient reports receiving his first covid vaccine dose 2-17-21 and experiencing symptoms, today Patient states, &#34;I can&#39;t feel the bottoms of my feet&#34; and &#34;it feels like I&#39;m going to throw up&#34;. Patient denies difficulty breathing. Patient was able to check pulse will on phone with triage nurse with pulse 93 and blood pressure 147/107. Patient requesting to have triage nurse call 911-EMS; HPI  The patient is a 69 year old male who states that he had the 1st dose of COVID vaccine yesterday morning.  The patient states that approximately 24 hours later, he developed stomach cramping.  He has nausea.  He denies any diarrhea.  He has not vomited.  Patient denies any cough or shortness of breath.  He complains of generalized weakness.  The patient also has chronic back pain.  Patient is noted to have a low-grade fever here, however, he does not report any fever. CHIEF COMPLAINT: WEAKNESS (per ems, pt got covid vaccine 24 hours ago, feeling weak and dizzy since 1500, tachycardia); Assessment/Plan DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition: 1. Hepatitis; The patient presents with a low-grade temperature, which isn&#39;t unexpected given that he received his COVID-19 vaccine yesterday.  However, the patient complains of abdominal pain.  Lab work does show elevated bilirubin, alk-phos, AST and ALT.  The patient has no previous history of this.  I did obtain both CT and ultrasound imaging of the gallbladder, which shows no pathology.  Subsequently, the patient was reassessed.  He is ambulated.  He is steady on his feet.  He does not desaturate.  He has no subjective complaints while walking.  I discussed the patient&#39;s lab abnormalities with him.  The patient prefers to go home and follow up for lab retesting on Monday.  Patient was given strict return instructions.  He will return should he develop any new or worsening symptoms.  He is going to have his labs redrawn on Monday and follow shortly with his primary care provider.  Given the normal imaging studies, I do think that these findings are likely related to a reaction to his vaccination.  This was discussed at length with the patient.  Patient is discharged home in stable condition.

                                                Day after first shot, experienced  some arm pain, elevated temperature, chills, very tired.  Of concern, blood pressure spiked to 149/78 (usually 120/70) and stayed elevated all day.  I contacted my cardiologist  late in the afternoon and he advised me to come in if the blood pressure did not return to normal the next day.  The next day, all symtoms disappeared and I felt normal.  When I received my second shot yesterday the doctor giving the injection said the blood pressure spike after the first shot was unusual and asked me to submit a VAERS  report.  My symptoms after the second shot  were a much more significant loss of mobility in the arm, which has returned to near normal.   but no blood pressure issue

                                                10 days after first dose of Moderna vaccine, I developed a very sore arm  starting with sharp pain at injection site and progressively radiating throughout upper arm and shoulder area, severe enough that I could not raise or use my arm.  This lasted about 24 hours and then started to dissipate throughout the next 24 hours.  I thought this was unusual because it was so long after the injection happened, and at the time of vaccination I had experienced very little arm pain.

                                                Friday evening, pt. was shaking so much that he could not even hold on to anything, had pain in his legs, hips, joints, knees to where he could not walk, and had a fever.  He had a hard time breathing as well so he went to the hospital.  They checked him out and ran tests but it was all in relation to the shot they thought.  Saturday he was very tired that he slept all day.  Sunday he was feeling better but had some issues with his vision and his peripheral vision went away for part of the day.

                                                Got shot Friday afternoon and reaction started Saturday night. Injection site had a blue coloration about 1/4 inch and began feeling like 1.5 inch of pencil was in my arm. I was feeling very warm and cold at the same time with a normal core temperature. Extreme pain on any movement of arm that caused to muscle to tense. Having a fan on me  really help my heat/cold sensation be normal.  Most of symptoms went away Sunday afternoon, pain in arm reduced and I felt lethargic but OK. Pain in arm had subsided a lot and just felt like injection pain. most range of movement pain free but it did hurt if I moved my left arm up across my chest. Monday morning  had no issues with anything and injection site had no pain on movement or touch. I could just tell I had the shot there and the discoloration was lighter.

My other two really bad reactions were as follows: Eight hours after shot I was shivering and cold no matter how many clothes I put on or how high I turned up the heat. This lasted 6 more hours. One hour after the shivering stopped I was overheated and sweated PROFUSELY. This lasted another 8 hours. Then the overheating and sweating just stopped and I was fine. Ps. my sister and I got the same shot, same Lot#, same day and she had the same shivering for 6 hours but not the sweating.

                                                Because of the absurd character limit in this field, I am putting my adverse reaction statement on the continuation page. About 10pm, about 9 hours post injection, I was feeling weak and fatigued.  I went to bed and was starting to feel chilled, but not shaking.  I hopped into bed and turned on my electric blanket in a room that was 75° (from passive solar house heating during the day) and wearing only a T-shirt, sweat shirt, and sweat pants.  The first post-vaccination symptom I experienced was when I laid down and my right upper arm (at the point of the injection) was very sore; it was too painful to lie on my right side.  The injection area felt hard. I fell asleep about 11pm and woke up about midnight; I am generally a very light sleeper, rarely sleeping more than ~3± hours (most less than) at a time.  At 1:30am, I could not sleep so I watched a recorded movie.  All the while, I was feeling progressively worse.  About 2:30am, I felt really chilled, so I cranked up the electric blanket to its highest setting and put on some heavy wool socks, a pair of long-johns under my sweat pants, put on another heavy sweatshirt over my existing sweatshirt, and placed another blanket on top of my electric blanket: very cold / chilled but not shivering.  The movie ended about 3am, and my stomach was excruciatingly aching.  I did not feel I could eat anything which I really felt a need to do, but was concerned that I would just vomit.  However, I did take two, 500mg Tylenol tablets with a half a glass of water.  I might have slept for an hour or so, but was quite restless.  I remember looking at the clock at 4:00am.  By 5am, it was considering calling 911; my stomach ached so badly.  It was then, that I had the feeling / recollection I had this &#34;illness&#34; before.  About 5:30am, my stomach symptoms started to ameliorate; by 7:30am, they were gone.  However, I still felt miserable.  I then wondered whether my stomach symptom was just a concomitant bout with &#34;stomach flu&#34; where I experienced (severe) abdominal cramps and pain; nausea; and low-grade fever.  I have had the stomach flu a limited number of times before and, after 6± hours, it all went away: I just had to suck it up in the meantime.  Before I filled out this report, I wanted to consider whether my stomach flu was a reaction to the vaccination or incidental to the vaccination.  However, after talking with my neighbors and my sister&#39;s friend, who also had the Moderna vaccination, three of the four &#34;victims&#34; had similar symptoms to me.  Thus, I deduced I did not have a bout with stomach flu.  Additionally, a dog walking partner, who is a rescue worker, also noted folks she knew also had similar symptoms with the Moderna vaccine.  I then started wondering what kind of artificial cocktail, a.k.a.: antifreeze, was the suspending medium for the vaccine.  If this has to be stored at absurdly low temperatures I commonly have negative reactions to artificial chemicals.  The minor surgeries I have had are uneventful but for the anesthesia chemical concoction I am given.  I commonly takes me more then 2-3 days to detoxify that and feel normal.&#39;  As in this case, I pretty much laid in bed for the next 2½ days, with no energy or desire to attend to personal issues, including walking my dogs.  However, my subclinical temperature was pretty much gone after the second day.  The notable soreness in my arm was mostly gone after two days, but the injection point was still sensitive to pressing on top of the injection site: I could still feel it.  I have a very high tolerance for pain and have never experienced anything like this.  &#34;Pain&#34; from flu, etc., shots rarely, if ever, lasts more than 10-15 minutes post injection.  There was definitely something in the suspension media that reacted with my body chemistry / biological processes.  I am NOT looking forward to the booster shot; most seem to have a reaction to the second shot that is worse than the first  unless their first shot was uneventful and the second shot had considerably milder reactions than my first shot.  The next time I will definitely have a bowl or two of jell-O in the refrigerator to help quell any (expected) gut reactions; jell-O has always been a comfort food for me in those situations. What a horribly designed survey.  This is next to impossible to complete online.  After timing out twice, I had to start over and opted to download the fillable form PDF.  Even then, I am not given the option to select the subdirectory _where_ it should be downloaded.  Fortunately, I saw the option to open it directly. If you are going to make the &#34;adverse reaction&#34; field so limited, relative to field size and the absurd online time limit, how can you expect meaningful, complete reporting of post-vaccination reactions?  This form CANNOT be fully completed in the time allotted without timing out.  This is, most certainly, a deterrent to adverse reaction reporting.  One has to wonder how many folks just gave up after getting timed out the first time. With this kind of disincentive, how good or complete or meaningful is the adverse data collection procedure?  Have you purged all the supporters?  They do not like real, accurate, objective data, particularly information that is not consistent what they want to believe or the narrative they want to spin.  No respectable scientist or decent journalist would accept third-rate data.  How can public interest decisions be made with a shoddy data collection effort?

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

                                                He received his vaccine, had a sore arm and that evening around 7 hours later it was as if a switch flipped he was not able to breath, and his wife noticed on his body she could see all his veins like a track on his trunk and everywhere.  He could not talk.   He said that he was burning up, was hot and clammy.  He got in the shower to cool himself down, and was told that the oxygen was not getting to where it was supposed to go.  His wife called 9-1-1 and the EMT&#39;s said that his oxygen had dropped down into the 60&#39;s. He went to the hospital and they said he had pulmonary edema that filled his lungs that quickly.  He was not intubated, and is on a BiPAP.  He was given Lasix, steroids, antibiotics trying to pull the fluid off of his lungs.  He has had so many different scenarios from people at the hospital right now and at one time one of his nurses said that his blood work showed a possible blood clot.  They looked at his lungs and they said that they did not see it in his lungs.  Then they said that he had a heart attack and that he needed a valve replacement.  Today, 3/25/21 they told him that he did not have a heart attack, did not need a valve replacement.  Last night they said that his BP was dangerously high and today, his BP is fine.  He also had an adverse reaction to the steroids and had a ROID rage from that as well giving the nurses and his wife a hard time, hanging up the phone on her, and said that he was leaving the hospital.   He was fine prior to the vaccine, and does not have any other issues for him to have this reaction.  He is in ICU and they keep saying that they are going to put him in a cardiac care unit.  He has a lot of IV lines and his 2nd COVID test came back negative.   He feels like they are just running test to get money out of him.  They said that he may be able to go home tomorrow.

                                                His symptoms began at 9PM of the day of the second dose of Moderna vaccine (gat 10AM 3/11/2021. He was well prior to the vaccine. He had no antecedent infection like the previous events of asthma attacks. He took Zyrtec the night before and the day of the vaccine of both doses of the vaccine.  He has not been any asthma medication for six years except 3-4 uses of albuterol during the fall Wildfire season. Vaccine lot numbers: 1st 041LZ0A, 2nd  003AQ1A. H ehad similar incident in 2012 after Reclast second dose. Had flushing first and then asthma flare. Lasted a couple weeks with just inhalers then had to do prednisone to calm it down. When tapered off he relapsed and had to do three iterations over a couple months.  After the second vaccine on Thursday AM, he was well until about 9PM that night, he developed sore throat and coughing that progressed through the night. On Friday AM he started using his nebulizer with albuterol and budesonide. His symptoms were manageable over the weekend. On Monday he coughed up a large collection of clear mucus and felt much better. On Wednesday 3/17, symptoms returned with cough and shortness of breath. He was started on a single dose of prednisone 40 mg and on Thursday he was seen in clinic. His symptoms seemed to be a mix of laryngeal and chest irritation. He was given an 8-day tapering course of prednisone and albuterol-ipratropium nebs every 6 hours. On follow up 3/25, he was much better except for side effects of the steroids. He is still being followed so I will provide updates if there is some change. He had a very similar reaction to Reclast in 2012 but has tolerated all other vaccines previously.

                                                Bells palsy on same side as vaccine; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning 69-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced facial palsy.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.    On 13 Jan 2021,the patient received his first of the two planned vaccine doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 039K20A).    On 10 Feb 2021, approximately 28 days after the first vaccine dose, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received his second of the two planned vaccine doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 028L20A), intramuscularly, in the left arm, for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unknown date, after 2.5 weeks of the second dose of vaccination, the patient experienced bell&#39;s palsy on the same side he received  the vaccine and was reported as ongoing at the time of report.    Treatment for the event included steroid, antiviral and eyedrops.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, facial paralysis and cerebrovascular accident, were considered not resolved at the time of report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I also had very noticeable aching light pain from one shoulder over to the other shoulder around the back of my neck during the first 6 hours of when this started. Today (4/1/2021) I woke up feeling normal and stronger and not so fatigue. I have been taking medications for diagnosed heart failure and do not know if the interactions of these helped to bring this on. My first shot of the Moderna vaccine shot was just a sore arm where the shot was given with no other reaction and I was on the heart failure medications back then.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. No adverse reaction or side effect from the first Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered on 25 Feb 21.   Approximately 15 hours after the second shot, administered 25 Mar 21, I developed a moderately severe tension headache on the lower left side of my head near the neck.  This continued for approximately 72 hours, slowly fading during that time period.  I also experienced general fatigue and overall mild pain for 24 hours, similar to a case of the flu but with no nausea.  Symptoms responded to Tylenol and one day bedrest.  No other adverse reactions.

I  NEVER HAD A PROBLEM BEFORE. IT STARTED OUT AS MILD PAIN  THE DAY OF THE   FIRST VACCINE  AND EXACERBATED AFTER THE 2ND.  I THOUGHT IT WOULD GO AWAY IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE ARM IS NOTICEABLY WEAKER THAN NORMAL AND ITS PAINFUL WHEN I TRY TO ABDUCT THE LEFT SHOULDER BEYOND 90 DEGREES. THERE&#39;S VERY LITTLE DISCOMFORT AT REST UNLESS I LIE ON IT. IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN 5 WEEKS SINCE I RECEIVED THE LAST DOSE OF THE VACCINE.

By about a week and a half out from his vaccine he states he was &#34;sleeping all the time.&#34;  At 2 weeks he had a bad nose bleed that lasted an hour and was extremely hard to stop.  A week later he had another bad nose bleed and couldn&#39;t stop it so went to the ER where they treated it with a &#34;plug.&#34;  The next day the ER removed the plug because it was bothering him so much.  Mid week on the 4th week he had another bad nose bleed and saw an ENT who cauterized it.  ENT advised he not receive dose 2 of the Covid vaccine in case the vaccine contributed to his severe nose bleeds.  No history of nosebleeds.

                                                Shot on 29MAR21. First lethargy began 31MAR21, followed by mild chills 01APR21. Over the weekend the symptoms waned and seemed to be subsiding. Wednesday of the following week, 07APR21 the chills became increasingly unpleasant especially at night requiring two extra blankets. Sharp pain radiating horizontally along the &#34;hip-girdle&#34; and up along the spine on the right side began that night. In the morning the top of my head was painfully sensitive to touch (like it is when I have the flu), I was slightly groggy and while the chills had subsided the hip &amp; back pain remained. I went to work thinking I might be passing a kidney stone as the symptoms were similar in location &amp; intensity as when I passed a stone in 2003. The chills became so severe I was wearing my jacket in my office and that&#39;s when I made an appointment at a local Urgent Care facility to see if they could perform an ultrasound for stones. When the scan proved negative, I had to assume I was experiencing side-effects from the vaccine. The symptoms diminished considerably by Sunday, so I returned to work Monday 12APR21 with no other issues.

A new stroke 24 hours after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccination Moderna  On Tuesday April 6, 2021 the patient showered by himself, walked up and down stairs in the home and was able to walk with the assistance of a cane.  He received the Moderna vaccination second dose at 10:00am (I believe this was an adverse event caused by the vaccination)  Wednesday April 7th at approximately 1:30pm I noticed he was unresponsive prompting me to call 911. His MRI at Hospital clearly diagnosed him as having another stroke, causing patient to no longer walk and use the restroom without assistance.  He is still in the hospital. Hospitalization and Physical Therapy is needed to allow patient to continue practicing as an Attorney.

He states that he really didn&#39;t do anything for a couple days and his mental capabilities were affected. He states he received his vaccination thurs and fri morning he called his friend to have him check on him every couple hours since he just didn&#39;t feel right. His friend told him by 2pm that he had a hard time having a conversation with him as he was only able to get out a few words and they didn&#39;t make sense. He had shaking, vomiting, weakness, fatigue, staggered when he walked and really doesn&#39;t have much memory of friday. He states his friend called the walk in clinic to see if he should go in and was told those were just normal side effects. Patient believes he had covid in the past month as he had altered taste and his friend had covid and was hospitalized with similar sx. He states his sense of taste is back to the saltiness that it was when he had covid. He reports that still on day 4 post vaccine, he doesn&#39;t feel he is mentally at baseline and is struggling to pull words out. He plans to make an appointment to see his physician today.

Could not stand up without the aid of his arms, low back was especially tight and felt like&#34; contacted&#34;.  Sought was seeing chiropractor about back pain more in the mid back prior but went to the ED with this new pain.  Was put on Prednisone, Flexeril, Lidocaine. and Tylenol.  Continued to have pain when standing and weakness requiring a walker or cane.  No one is sure this is related to the vaccine but the symptoms worsened within about 24 hours of the second dose.  Improving now but still limited by weakness and pain.

After that it was just full body tension and sense of nervousness.  But the real problem is that it brought back a relapse of MS symptoms that were under control for 20 years.  Weak, burning heavy legs. This has been steady for 10 days now.  This has made me trepidatious about the second dose.

This seemed to stuck in my esophagus causing pain in the chest. I could not swallow even water and the pain (spasm) subsided in 15-20 min. I did not try to anyting else on that day and only rested. Next day (04/08/2021) a similar problem appeared when I tried to swallow the first bite of lunch. It felt as the piece got stuct in the middle of esophagus and I could not move it in any direction. The pain kept increasing for 20 min and a clear flegm came to my mouth probably from stomach and started to interfere with breathing. I managed to wash my mouth and physically remove most of the sticky flegm. I managed to rest

Symptoms in leg resolved over 2 weeks with PT.  R-foot began to swell 2 weeks later with pain over and below base of R toe that progressed with heat, swelling, and redness over lower R-foot. Physician thought knee problems may be due to gout because of presentation so a prescription for a methylprednisolone was made available (6 day taper  (21, 4 mg tabs) instituted within 24 hrs of severe foot symptoms).

I will not follow guidelines that are against my best judgment for right or wrong.   I knew better then to get the second vaccine so quickly.  There was no research that indicated this was the optimum time frame.   The only justification was what was done during the trials, which was to rush it to market and garner the highest efficacy numbers.   As seen here, the outcome was anything but mild side effects and they continue.

On the afternoon at an unknown time, his leg had gotten worse.  He had severe pain on his left leg; it was painful to the touch; it was swollen and was hard as a rock.  He called 911.  He was taken to  Hospital.  Pt wanted me to report that he did not receive any treatment for his blood clot.  He received a Lidocaine patch on his knee and was given a prescription for Voltaren Gel.  (he was expecting to receive TPA to dissolve the clot like a few times before when he had blood clots but this particular time he did not)

This morning I woke up and felt achy with muscular pains and arm sorer than yesterday and it was swollen a little. As the day went on I discovered aches and pains around my body and felt weak and not very robust. The aches and pains were unusual in my legs and elsewhere.  I had to cancel my physical activities today because I didn&#39;t have the energy to do them, like yesterday right after vaccination.  I didn&#39;t feel like I had the strength or energy to do anything.

                                                transverse myelitis; paralyzed waist down; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of MYELITIS TRANSVERSE (transverse myelitis) and PARALYSIS (paralyzed waist down) in a 69-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 040A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     No medical history was provided by the reporter.  Concomitant products included DOCUSATE SODIUM (STOOL SOFTENER) for Constipation.    On 09-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MYELITIS TRANSVERSE (transverse myelitis) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged, disability and medically significant) and PARALYSIS (paralyzed waist down) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged, disability and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from sometime in March 2021 to sometime in 2021 due to MYELITIS TRANSVERSE, and then on sometime in March 2021 due to PARALYSIS. At the time of the report, MYELITIS TRANSVERSE (transverse myelitis) outcome was unknown and PARALYSIS (paralyzed waist down) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Additional concomitant medications included a non-specific antidepressant and rosacea medication.

                                                Took 600mg of Ibuprofen (200mg x3) orally at 7:45AM, 30 minutes later while viewing a medical webinar at my desk at home, I suddenly noticed significant itching of my entire hands which quickly became reddened and progressively swollen as the itching sensation become more generalized within 10-15 minutes. I got up from my chair to go tell my wife but as I walked a few paces, I became extremely weak with visual &#39;closing in&#39; as I barely prevented myself from collapsing to the floor / losing consciousness. At the same time my tongue was now thickened and malfunctioning making my spoken words to my wife almost unintelligible - all consistent with a CLASSIC ANAPHYLAXIS REACTION.  My wife helped me to the couch to recline where I carefully swallowed CHLORPHENIRAMINE 8MG, FAMOTIDINE 20MG; and 15 minutes later DIPHENHYDRAMINE 50MG (I did not have any Epinephrine available from prior &#39;bee sting kits&#39;). At no time was my breathing impaired nor was there any audible wheezing or dyspnea. After ~45 minutes I was improving noticeably, and after ~2-3 hours I had made a 100% recovery with no sequelae thereafter. Although I had taken my routine morning medications several HOURS PRIOR, nevertheless, (after purchasing several vials of Epinephrine 1mg/1mL for protection in case of another reaction), after this event and over the succeeding days I re-added each of those medications separately / one-at-a-time to ensure that NONE of those was the offending agent - NO problems ensued. For obvious reasons, I have 100% AVOIDED ingesting Ibuprofen or other typical NSAIDs since this episode (although my routine single daily aspirin tablet has presented no problems). BOTTOM LINE: DESPITE HAVING USED IBUPROFEN 400MG OR 600MG PERHAPS 1-2 TIMES WEEKLY AS NEEDED FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT OVER MANY YEARS, NEVER UNTIL THIS ANAPHYLACTIC EPISODE 11 DAYS AFTER MY SECOND DOSE OF MODERNA&#39;S COVID-19 VACCINE HAD THERE EVER BEEN ANY TYPE OF ADVERSE REACTION TO IBUPROFEN WHATSOEVER.

Tylenol was finally able to reduce the fever, but the next day it rose to 102,  and the following day also to 102, still having pains in his legs. On day 4, his oxygen level dropped to 80 (he did have congestive heart failure exactly one year ago, but it was corrected in ten days and his oxygen level had been perfect until the vaccine). We are now on day 6 and his oxygen is slowing improving after increasing Lasix. His body had an awful shock with this vaccine which medical people feel contributed to him almost sinking to congestive heart failure again. Even with all his medications he presents as a healthy individual usually.

                                                On the evening of the 15th day after my vaccination and a couple of hours after reporting once again that I was perfectly fine, I had a sudden shaking of my body which lasted about 30 minutes. it was so bad I couldn&#39;t hold a glass of water without spilling it. I got up and walked around, did some deep breathing, tucked my hands under my armpits and tried to resume watching TV. After about 30 minutes it calmed down but did not go away. I wasn&#39;t chilled. my temp was 100. I took to Tylonal and went to bed, shivering. Earlier this same day, around 4pm, I had started dry coughing quite bit but didn&#39;t think much about it. In the morning, after a restless night, my temp was 99. I felt sluggish, and weak but not sick. No activity, no walking that day of Saturday. Took 2 more Tylonal mid day. Temp was down to 98. That night, temp 98, I took Niqual and slept soundly. Sunday morning temp was 97.3 and I was feeling a lot better and continued to feel better to normal by Monday morning. A reaction to the drug 15 days after I thought was strange. I had no vaccination site redness or pain t any time. I wondered if I had actually contracted the virus. I&#39;m ok now. Did not call for medical help. I have never been tested for he Covid 19 virus.

                                                I sleep on my left side.  I woke up to a tingling numbness feeling from four inches distal to my lower left wrist to the bilateral tip of my left baby finger and the left side of my left ring finger.  As I further woke I felt a warm numbing feeling: 1) from the lower left wrist to a point distal to the left elbow, 2) to the deep left side of my neck, 3) under the left corner of the left eye causing a very minor amount of extra tearing on the left side of the eye and 4) my left forehead to an alignment to the right corner of the left eye.

                                                Possible MSG reaction, probably aggravated after vaccination.   Had meal approx. 1 hour before vaccination.   After vaccination (roughly 45 minutes), felt &#34;foggy&#34; feeling, akin to being drunk.   After looking for possible links to vaccine, and given that the reaction seemed like a strong reaction previously attributed to  MSG, searched the ingredients listed by the caterer and found that a side dish listed MSG.   ~~  Drove home without incident.  &#34;Foggy&#34; feeling dissipated after a few hours.   No significant reaction to the vaccine itself except slightly sore arm.

                                                2/16/2021:  Telephone call to PCP/DR: I.  This is all a little strange. Especially with the fever. I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.  He was told to go back on Mycophenolate which he started on Friday. Left hand pain from palm to wrist on Saturday.  Some shoulder pain on the left and right side.  Sunday pain got worse.  Went to the ER at hospital yesterday.  Dx&#39;d with carpal tunnell syndrome and gave him a wrist brace. He is taking tylenol/ibuprofen (200mg two tabs q 8 hours) as directed. Temp was 99.8 yesterday.  Temp is 99.5 this morning altho he is taking ibu/tylenol as directed. His wife reports he has traveling pain.  Today is pain is in the Right hand and right shoulder.  No left sided pain today.  Today he is able to hold a spoon in the left hand. He had a &#34;real rough night last night&#34;, didn&#39;t sleep much. She has called Rheum but hasn&#39;t heard from them. Okay to put him in with NP? For ER follow up?  Or should something else be done? 2/19/2021: Call to office PCP/DR. His wife called saying that he went to the emergency room for severe pain in his left hand and swelling he could not hang on to anything.   The pain started on Friday and kept getting worse all weekend . The er told him that it was carpel tunnel and gave him a wrist splint.  His wife says that she call his rheumatologist and they started him on prednisone 40 X 3 days, 30 X3 days, 20 X 3 days, 10 for 3 days then stop.  She states that now he is having traveling pain it went into his left shoulder and arm. Now it is in his right shoulder and hand the right hand is very swollen can not make a fist. This am she states that he is limping on the right leg the cord in the back is very painful,  She then states that now that she thinks about it over a week ago in the evening he told her several nights that he was having difficulty swallowing first it was on the left side then the right side of his throat he did salt water gargles and was fine in the morning but it has continued to come back every night she states now he is saying that it fells like there is something in his throat.  Since yesterday it is on the left side of his throat.  She is call the rheumatologist but wonders what you think. 2/19/2021: OV with PCP see previous.

I try and walk 3 miles every day, but began to notice left leg discomfort and slight pain from my hip to my ankle when walking.  Do not notice this discomfort when sleeping or if my leg is propped up.  Feet are both fine and my right leg is fine, no pain.   Also notice that it is harder and slower getting out of bed in the morning and I get drowsy earlier at night than I used to.  By 9 PM I feel like I want to go to bed.

                                                After my first Covid vaccine on Jan 11 I began to experience some pain and stiffness in my left hand.    In particular it was kind of cramped up and stiff when I woke up in the morning.   Two days after my second Covid vaccine on Feb 8,   those symptoms became much worse.   My hand was very stiff in the morning and I couldn&#39;t straighten my index finger except by pulling it up with my other hand.  Prior to receiving the Covid vaccines, I had never experienced these issues before.

                                                After an adverse reaction to the Covid 19 Vaccine, the emergency room Doctor suggested I contact you for a follow-up visit.   Dateline and symptoms:  03/01 Received first Moderna Covid Vaccination at 3:45 p.m... 03/02 No symptoms until 6 p.m. When blood pressure started to go up from my normal level of 116/68 to 179/82 by 10 p.m..  During this time I had what felt like mild electric currents from the left side of my chest down my left arm and into my hand.  These systems subsided around 11 p.m. and by midnight my blood pressure was almost back to normal. 03/03 Felt sluggish all day but no blood pressure problems. 03/04 Felt great all day then around 6 p.m. my blood pressure started to rise, by 9:30 p.m. it was 190/90.  At this time I started to feel like my body was shutting down, my face felt flush, and experiencing long distant vision problems, so I had my wife take me to the emergency room. At 10:00 p.m. I went to the emergency room  EKG  showed no heart problems, the blood test showed no heart problems, and after 11:30 p.m. my blood pressure started going down and I was released at 1:30 a.m..  Blood test did show high levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen 26.0, Bun/Creatinine Ratio 33.0, Aspartate Amino Tranf (AST/SGOT) 43, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) 59 and Alkaline Phosphatase 189, all of which are higher than my last blood test on 10/22/20. 03/05  As of 10:30 a.m. my blood pressure is 126/62.  I feel fine except I&#39;m very tired from not much sleep last night.  1p.m. Starting to feel some more chest and arm symptoms as described before, blood pressure now 146/66. Events happened twice, 2 days apart.

At 3:00pm I experienced a surge  of heat in my body and my blood pressure dropped to 76/38 - pulse 38.  I was  not able to stand.

                                                Severe fatigue, severe muscle aches, severe to moderate periodic itching\ pin prick sensations especially in palms of hands, soles of feet, and occasionally elsewhere on my body (e.g., inner ear, trunk, arms). The muscle aches and pin prick sensations have awakened me repeatedly for the past two nights, resulting in poor sleep. After 2 1/2 days, the fatigue and muscle aches are mostly gone, but the itching\pin prick sensations (somewhat like the sensations one gets with a case of shingles, which I had once 25&#43; years ago, or when warming extremities after being exposed to extreme cold) are still intermittently present.

                                                My father received the first Covid shot 3/2; he woke up 3/3 with severe body aches and weakness, which we thought nothing of.  However, every day, he got weaker and weaker. He has been treated for Liver cancer, he received his first infusion of Opdivo almost 4 weeks before the vaccination.  About 7 days after the shot, he was having trouble swallowing so he went to the ER to get a CT scan. He was found to have greatly elevated troponins, the DR was baffled he wasn?t having any chest pain; they were apparently not trending either., he has never had a heart attack or any other heart problems, takes Nadolol for high blood pressure. The CT scan showed significant growth of his tumors  which had been stable for a year and the last CT scan was the end of January; liver enzymes were also significantly elevated whereas they were stable before.  My father deteriorated rapidly, and died on 3/18/21. The day he got the shot just prior, he was hauling wood, shoveling snow and living a normal life feeling good. The day after the shot he could barely get out of bed he was so weak, until he finally died 16 days later.

He took Tylenol every 4-5 hrs. &amp; stayed in bed. By Sunday his fever slowly started to go down.  And by the following  Mon. morning, 3/8/21, his fever was gone.  He felt weak but otherwise well enough to perform normal day-to-day activities/work.  12 days after that, on 3/20/21, he developed the exact same symptoms &amp; went to bed immediately &amp; took appropriate Tylenol.  His fever, this time, only went to just under 100.  He is scheduled for his second shot on 4/2/21.  Should he get it?  If not, what does he do???

                                                On 3/24 by 9:25 PM I had mild shakes. At about 10:00 PM my lips stared to tingle and become numb. Subsequently I began to have difficulty swallowing as well as experiencing some sub sternal pain. Went to get my Epipen and put it beside me in bed. Difficulty swallowing got a bit worse but as I was not experiencing shortness of breath I held off the Epinephrine injection. (What on earth was I thinking?!)The &#34;semi anaphylaxis&#34; was self limiting and by 11:00 PM symptoms had subsided completely. But by approximately 11:30 MP I had severe rigors lasting about 3 - 5 minutes. On 3/25 I developed a severe headache and a low grade T (T-max 99.9). Took Tylenol 825mg with good effect. The following night I had severe night sweats, drenching 3 sets of pajamas. Today, on 3/26 I have been experiencing several cold sweats and I am altogether feeling &#34;strange&#34; (can&#39;t put my finger on it - maybe dehydration?). Have vegan to aggressively hydrate. Notified my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office. Agreed to &#34;ride it out&#34; for now. Shall see my PPP on

                                                How the Vaccine affected my Sleep Apnea  Diagnosed: Severe Sleep Apnea Obstructive &amp; Central 2 ½ years ago with 55 events/hour Machine: BiPap ResMed AirCurve 10 ASV with Memory Foam Full Mask  Vaccine: Moderna  My first shot had little effect with minimal soreness in my arm and a slight headache. The second shot had much more effect on me. I was very active the day of the second shot and the next day. Then it hit me hard. One of the greatest benefits of my Bi-Pap is how it works on my depression and anxiety. I was really sick with headaches, fever, no energy, body aches and really being in bed all day. Unfortunately the depression hit me also. It is like a lead blanket (like the dentist uses for x-rays) over you as you ball up in bed as your mind thinks why do I exist and how to end it with more feeling of anxiety. It really felt like I would die but knew from my experience that it may pass. Luckily it did but it took 10 days before feeling alive again. I also wondered why my events/hour increased at this time and concluded that the vaccine affected my Sleep Apnea.  My Data:  30 day average: 6.34 events/hour  90 day average: 4.64 events/hour 365 day average 3.89events/hour  As you see I have a good events/hour average but it has really increased this month since I got the Vaccine. Here are my numbers.  First Vaccine February 2021 18th  3.0 events/hour (day of shot) 19th  8.6 events/hour 20th  5.2 events/hour 21st  3.1 events/hour 22nd 2.2 events/hour  Second Vaccine March 2021 18th 4 events/hour (day of shot) 19th 6.8 events/hour 20th 15.5 events/hour 21st  5 events/hour 22nd 7.1 events/hour 23rd  5.3 events/hour 24th  5.2 events/hour 25th  6.9 events/hour 26th  3.6 events/hour 27th  2.9 events/hour

Unclear when began to feel bad. 3/11/2021  9:07 pm EMS transported to Hospital Center ED for altered mental status following vaccination. ED physician note states &#34;70 y/o male with pmhx of CAD, CVA, HTN, DM, myopathy and DVT on  Xarelto presents to ED with complaints of generalized weakness and change in mental status onset yesterday. Patient received his COVID vaccine yesterday and since then, patients wife is concerned he is not behaving himself and appears confused. Wife is also concerned he has a deceased appetite and decreased PO intake. Patient has no complaints at this time. Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain and back pain. HPI is limited due to patients mental status.&#34;  4/3/2021 when being scheduled for follow-up dose on 4/7/2021 his wife informed us &#34;He had a bad reaction  to the first dose of the vaccine, had to go to the hospital, was admitted and had to stay for 3 days does not want the 2nd dose.&#34;  4/3/2021 Dr (one reporting) checked system and talked to wife to obtain this history. Agreed with her that he should not receive the second dose due to how badly he felt after the first. In addition, his prior history of COVID likely gives him sufficient protection against COVID-19.

By the afternoon was feeling better.  However the long term effects for 5 days was elevated blood glucose levels that were not responding properly to Humalog premeal injections. It appears that I was more insulin resistant than usual.

Following the injection, and within 24 hours, I began experiencing severe vasovagal, with severe bloating, severe headaches, severe weakness and mental cloudiness.  It is difficult, and at times virtually impossible to urinate and defacate.  Any tissues with columnar linings are severely swollen, from the eustachian tubes to trachea and esophagus, including all intestinal organs.  In fact all organ systems are involved.  It is very painful, and has forced my retirement from practice, as I cannot provide the care that is needed for my patients.  Severe fatigue continues, with severe headaches, cloudiness, inability to concentrate.

On CT of neck, an aortic dissection was partially visualized. A CT of his chest was done and aortic dissection was diagnosed. He was transferred to IMC for surgery. At surgery, it was discovered that the dissection had been chronic. He struggled during recovery and was eventually discharged to a SNF. Unfortunately, he developed a stroke in the SNF and was brought back to the ER on 03/17/2021. His prognosis is poor and on 03/22/2021 he was discharged home on hospice.

                                                After being vaccinated for the 2nd time with the Moderna vaccine on Feb. 27, 2021, I had an increased fever, temperature, weakness, coughing, and dizziness. All these symptoms continued for up to 2-3 days as heavy as, then gradually moved to my &#34;normal health&#34; after almost 7-days. During this period I took only Cetamol tablets based on the advice of my primary care physician on phone mesaging. Nowadays, I witness symptoms of tinnitus which appeared directly after the 2nd vaccine. The tinnitus was a wavy (up-down) case but it now a serious and continuous issue. This is something I did not witness or suffer from in the past. The tinnitus is impacting me a lot, and sometimes I can&#39;t sleep well.

He experienced flu like symptons for about 24 hours. This was on Saturday. On Tuesday he died. They said it was a heart attack. He was in excellent health. We had gone to the gym 3 days a week for years. He was doing Cardio on the bike and treadmill for over an hour each time. He never experienced shortness of breath and before the shot was 100 % healthy

I had listlessness, fatigue, cold/flu symptoms, etc.  With the second shot on 3/29/21, I didn&#39;t seem to have as much of a reaction, but then I started getting diarrhea, and a flare in my Crohn&#39;s.  Since then I have had abdominal spasms, bleeding (as if I was on blood thinners), increased bowel urgency, several bowel accidents, stomach pain, and severe fatigue.  I have contacted my doctor for assistance in my treatment but thought I should report this in case it was a response to the vaccine.

                                                He got the vaccine, he came home and was very weak, maybe a little bit of a low grade temp.  Went to bed, got up the next morning and felt okay other than weakness and had to get a caregiver to help take care of his wife as he was not able to.  Had a temp last night of 101.9, weakness to the point that he is falling over, no equilibrium at all, not able to get himself up from the couch last night.  Very active gentleman for his age, so this is very unusual for him and it scared him that he was not able to get up.  He has a severe headache since having the vaccine.  He does have a large knot where he got the vaccine, as well as redness and soreness.  He is still feeling the same today, very very weak, no temp though.  4/22/21.  He did take 2 Advil for his temp yesterday and hasn&#39;t had anything today.

                                                Upon waking on 1/1/21 I stepped with my right leg, as the left leg followed it buckled along with acute pain in the hip joint and along the calf. I hobbled/hopped to the hall calling out to my wife and  slid along the wall to the floor rubbing my leg and calf. After a few minutes I regained mobility and have not had that same experience. I have hadintervals of sharp aching in the hip joint and calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to experience a numbness/tingling from the injection site to my elbow as well as along my left leg and a general weakness in my left arm. After waiting a few weeks to see if things would change,I reported it anecdotally to our Infection Control Nurse and she advised me to report to VAERS.

Was confused , trying to give me his remote to do what with I wasn&#39;t sure.  He had trouble with getting ideas across.  I wasn&#39;t sure if this was normal for him.  However, we called him this morning at 8:45 am and he was lucid, he stated that when he went home around 4 pm , his left arm , hand and face were numb.  He stated that he could not pick up his cap with his left hand.  Today he woke and feels normal.  He was lucid and able to present ideas in a normal manner.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient let me know that he had a warm sensation  from the injection site up to the left side of his neck and tightness of the left side of his neck.  I asked if he felt like his throat was closing and he said no.  At this time, I gave the patient a diphenhydramine tablet 25 mg tablet and a bottle of water and observed him.  I took the patient&#39;s blood pressure about 10 minutes later and it was 170/75. I asked if this was a normal level for him and he said when he took it last week it was 180 over something.  I continued observing the patient and took his blood pressure again in 10 minutes. It was in the same range. The patient left approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine. He said that he was feeling better.  I called the patient to follow up at 3 pm. I asked if he was feeling better. He said, &#34;I think I&#39;m ok.&#34; I asked if he was still experiencing the symptoms from earlier and he said, &#34;No, I left those symptoms in Massillon.&#34;

                                                Yesterday around 1:30PM I received my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine. All went well between the time I got the shot to the time I went to bed at about 10PM. I thought I had it made. At midnight I awoke with intense shivering. I absolutely couldn&#39;t stop. I wasn&#39;t cold as my body was hot. I had plenty of covers, but I was hot and shivering cold. Include a severe headache in this picture. This went on for a good hour and I finally settled down and dozed off again. This morning I have a mild headache and a really sore shoulder where I received the vaccine.

By early Friday evening, the night after the vaccination, I began having severe steady pain in my left kidney, along with sharp shooting pain at the same location.  I also had the expected headache and fatigue. I took Tylenol during this time, and still am. I was pretty much totally bed-ridden for 4 days.  I called my doctor on Wednesday, February 17th to report the severe reaction in my left kidney. The nurse told me that as long as I felt better each day then to weather it out and get  the second shot (scheduled for March 11).  Although I am feeling a little better, I am still taking Tylenol for the pain in my kidney. My exhaustion is lessening.

                                                Extreme fatigue and muscle stiffness in legs and back commenced on Wednesday, Feb. 17, and have continued through today, 2-21-21. Experienced considerable injection arm soreness for 12 hours after injection on 2-4-21. Injection was at 10:25 a.m.,  and, remarkably, soreness disappeared by 10:00 p.m. on 2-4-21. I have been getting extra sleep, and walking at little less than my usual routine of 6,000 steps per day. Extreme fatigue not noticed for ten or eleven days, until 2-17-21.

                                                About an hour after the shot I felt nauseous and light-headed and a little mild weakness. It sort of came in mild waves over the course of 2 to 3 hours. Never really disabled me just bothersome and made me want to just sit. Symptoms seemed to disappear after I ate supper.  I felt fine the next morning save fore some soreness just below the injection site.

He couldnt put words together to make a sentence.  He got up to go into the kitchen and then urinated all over himself.  He was worried about falling sleep, scared he would die in his sleep.  The 3rd woke up and was feeling some better but still foggy headed.  Pt went to the ER about 5 days later.  They did a CT and blood work.  He thinks the tests results came back negative. They wanted him to stay longer and maybe see a Neurologist but since there wasnt one available to see at that time the pt decided to go home.  He has blood work and urine labs to be done at the facility on 2/23/2021.  Pt states he is feeling better at this time.

New syringe and needle used, 0.5 ml administered in right deltoid). Client denied any pain, numbness, tingling, or other sensation.  Attempted to contact patient on 3/3/2021 at 9:14 AM to follow up. No answer. Left voicemail to return call. No return call as of 3/3/2021 4:12 PM. Will attempt to contact again within this week.

This progressed to exhibit a growing red blotchy area only in the area of the injection.  This peaked at around day 11, with the area being about  7 in. X  4 in. The symptoms were mild and did not require any pain medication. The visible symptoms at day 15 were mostly gone.

                                                Patient with delayed vasovagal likely syncopal episode several hours after vaccine received:  &#34;I wanted to let my Dr know that I had an incident on Friday.  Sitting at home talking with my wife ant two friends and started feeling &#34;dizzy&#34;. They said I started shaking and head rolled back and I was out for a minute. I did not know anything had happened when I opened my eyes.  They insisted that I go to the hospital.  EMS came and tested me on the way to hospital- all tests good. Same at the hospital- you may have the results.   Not a seizure, no high blood pressure, maybe vaccine reaction? they weren&#39;t sure what it was, and wanted to keep me overnight and I said no thanks. Home about 5 PM I feel fine.  Please let me know if you want to go over.

                                                felt so bad; severe chest pain; Chest pain and arm pain; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning her husband, a 71-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced abnormal feeling, severe chest pain,  and arm pain.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included the patient had a heart attack on 26 May 2020 and on October 2020 the patient had five bypass, two arteries they took. Since October the patient&#39;s condition was stated to be great. Concomitant medications reported included Insulin Bovine, Multivitamins [vitamins Nos], acetylsalicylic acid and Medication related to patient&#39;s heart attack.  On 12 Feb 2021, unspecified days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:007M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Feb 2021, post receiving mRNA-1273, the patient had no reaction and did not feel bad.  On unspecified day in Feb 2021 one week prior to the reporting the events, the patient experienced chest pain and arm pain, minimum that lasted for 10 minutes. 3 or 4 night prior reporting the event, the patient was feeling abnormal, went to ER and was hospitalized with severe chest pain.

                                                I received part one of the Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine  on  March 10, 2021 at 8:11 a.m.. The next day on March 11, 2021 3:00 pm  I had a bad reaction to the Moderna vaccine which was sudden onset of loss of mental clarity. Could not remember how old I was or even what decade I was born in, could not remember my passwords, what TV show I watched last night, the name of the place where I got vaccinated. I have never experienced loss of mental clarity before. The physical symptom was a sore arm. I went to bed early and woke up fully recovered, mentally restored and normal.

I went to bed early.  Got up the next morning and discovered red rash at injection site.  Rash (looks like sunburn) went from shoulder to elbow.  I also was lightheaded.   Had occasional  periods of more extreme dizziness throughout the  day that were several seconds in duration .

Developed bad headache which prevented sleeping. The next day, it seemed this was over, but still had no appetite and in the evening the shaking and shivering resumed. Developed another bad headache that prevented sleeping again. Next morning  (today) still no appetite and continued to feel cold. Have eaten some even with no appetite, so I could take ibuprofen which seemed to help a bit.

It improved over next week only to reappear after second vaccine and in this case took 6 weeks to disappear. It was painful and verified by two dentists who saw lesion.  I also develop three days after second vaccine, pain in right calf region and numbness in my right foot involving lateral toes and heel region. the pain disappeared within hours but the numbness has remained, now 6 weeks ater though is less than initially,   After both the first and second vaccinations, I had hemorrhagic sinusitis that lasted at least two weeks with significant drainage resulting in cough.   I had two negative Covid tests after first vaccine to confirm this was vaccine related and I had not contracted Covid.

First noticed it 3 weeks or so after the first injection. Treated with benadryl spray/cream topically and oral to help with sleep. Not painful at first, but did develop an itching and painful area after a few days. It is now March 16th and right  arm pit is STILL red.  I had thought it was an insect bite, but did not act like that and it has  eased up, bit not gone away.  It was not until a week AFTER the Second Moderns shot in the opposite left arm  that a rash developed on the LEFT armpit/axilla area did it occur to me that it may be vaccine related and should be reported.  I have pictures.

                                                Starting with malaise and tiredness at about 5pm, this progressed to notable muscle tremors within 1 hour, getting progressively worse over the next hour or so.. Malaise and tremors continued for about 2 hours (approx) until sleep at about 9:30. The next day, tremors completely resolved but malaise and tiredness continued. This mostly resolve after 2 days, but notable I became tired more easily for the next couple of days, with no other change in routine. My wife, who received a vaccination at the same time (and from the same lot) as I did suffered similar symptoms but hers resolved somewhat more quickly and did not apparently last over days.

                                                I spoke on 03/09/2021 with a question from him. He received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine as Moderna on 02/16/2021. He reports he did well with his shot initially and didn&#39;t really even have a sore arm. About 6-7 days after his vaccine, however, he started getting some significant redness, warmth, tenderness and then swelling in his arm that continued to worsen. became concerned that his reaction was more than would be normally expected so he was seen by a doctor who diagnosed him with cellulitis and started him on antibiotics and steroids. He had completed his antibiotics at the time of our conversation and said his arm felt better but was still slightly red. His doctor recommended that he not get a second dose of Moderna, but suggested that he might get a Pfizer or a Janssen vaccine instead, and was wondering about our recommendation for this? I let patient know that there are no specific studies for the interchangability  of these vaccines but there is a statement from CDC that says if an individual is unable to get a 2nd dose of an mRNA vaccine due to a contraindication, they could consider getting one dose of Janssen vaccine at least 28 days after the first dose to have a complete valid J&amp;J dose. I encouraged to speak with his provider about this possibility and any further action. I did some education on potential causes of cellulitis and let him know that per immunization guidance, cellulitis isn&#39;t necessarily a contraindication to a second dose of vaccine but more of a precaution as it can be difficult to know the exact cause and a second dose may not result in the same side effect. Several times reported no respiratory symptoms or other symptoms than the cellulitis. I again recommended him to speak with his provider for the best plan of action and he agreed to this.

The next day my legs started to feel funky, but I had a strong 4 wheel rollator and I continued on to assist my wife with getting her first shot at . By the time we got to the  elevators, after walking about two blocks the legs were feeling worse. On the way out my wife noticed me walking poorly and after about one block my legs &#34;gave out&#34; completely and I collapsed.

He had no muscle strengle to get up.  I had to call a neighbor to help.  I called my dr office and they said to keep him hydrated and keep an eye on him.  That&#39;s all  My son came and stayed with us on Thursday, the two of us got him into bed.  He slept the night and when he woke in the morning he had his strength back.  I had him rest for the rest of the week. So very scary.

This was basically one very bad day -- the day after the vaccination, which was my second vaccination.  The night sweats and nightmares went on for 4-5 nights after the vaccination.  Everything is OK now though.

                                                28 days (March 20th) following 1st Moderna shot which was given on Feb 23rd, felt dizzy, weak and lightheaded leading to fainting (syncope).  Ambulance arrived and determined to take me to hospital after having 2nd syncope in their presence.  Remained in hospital overnight.  All vitals, heart and bloodwork were fine as seen by cardiac doctor and  determined it was dehydration.  Followed up with primary physician and told him I was urinating excessively.  He put me on Flomax 0.4 mg.  I had the 2nd Moderna shot on March 23rd and again was taken to the hospital on March 31st with same symptoms and near syncope and again was told it was clinical dehydration.  They told me to drink a combination of pedialite and water which I have been doing and I am still experiencing the dizziness, lightheadedness and weakness.  Woke up on April 4th and felt like my soul was being ripped from my body.  I honestly thought I was going to die. Looked on line and found forums of people experiencing similar symptoms.  Went to pharmacy and they recommended meclizine and have taken a clonipin for anxiety.  I am feeling better now, but worried about how long I will be experiencing these symptons.

                                                Received the first dose of covid vaccine on 2/11.  About 2/25, started to develop a sun rash on elbows and arms.  Gradually, rash extended to hands and was quite severe.  Applied a salve prescribed by physician which was somewhat effective and skin gradually cleared.  Now, whenever arms or legs are exposed to sunlight, burning and itching effect the exposed area (but, so far, no rash).

                                                2 days after the shot, when I woke up, I could hardly move my legs. after a day or two, I was able to walk a couple of steps. Have to use a cane with 3 feet for stability. I was undergoing severe pain throughout this time. Pain from my lower back, left hip and left leg to left knee.  Was given physical therapy through the VA for 6 weeks and that helped loosen my leg up, but still in serious pain. After 2 months i am still in moderate pain but it is slowly lessening. VA has precsribed both Chiropractic and Massage treatments for me in the future.  I have lost 2 months of work and hit hard financially.

On 4/18/2021 I noticed some difficulty eating experiencing some mouth numbness.  The right side of my face was drooping and right eye would not close completely.  I went to the  Hospital Emergency Room mid day on the 18th.  I was examined and after some tests it was determined that I was not experiencing a stroke, but Bell&#39;s Palsy.  This was determined by the tests outlined below.  I was admitted overnight for observation and discharged the next day. I have no idea if this is related to my Covid vaccination but report this only out of an abundance of caution.

                                                Approximately 2 to 3 weeks after my second Moderna injection, I experienced a burning sensation in my thumbs and noticed a large lump on my left thumb along with a small wart. Rubbing the painful thumbs for several minutes reduced the burning sensation and shortly after stopped hurting. The burning sensation reoccurred a few more times during the week or two following the initial occurrence. Subsequently, the large lump has reduced in size but the small wart is still present.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell&#39;s Palsy  01/02/21 1231

I developed severe chills and low grade fever, muscle and joint pain, my hands and feet were cold, headache, and uncontrolled yawning, I suppose my body&#39;s attempt to cool the brain. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and the symptoms mostly abated, but returned about 4hrs later. I am treating myself with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. I have not seen my PCP, I feel the symptoms will resolve with time, if not I will follow-up. I cannot find anything in the literature but do people that have had covid get a stronger reaction from the vaccine?

                                                About 30 minutes after the administration of the vaccine, his case manager came to ask for assistance because the client was feeling unsteady and his speech seemed slower than it normally is.  She was worried about an allergic reaction.  He did seem a little shaky.  They had him sit on a bench outside for fresh air.  He said this was helping.  I took his radial HR.  It was regular, 70 bpm.  I was unable to get his blood pressure due to a broken cuff.  He was feeling much better at that point.  He did eat breakfast.  He said his arm felt fine.  No rash or hives observed and no shortness of breath.   His case worker brought him some water.  We sat there for about 15 minutes.  He felt much better and the case worker said he seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.

Then, 12 days after the vaccination, a red rash started to be seen at the area where the injection was. That area felt warm. The nest two days, including today, the rash started to spread, covering a major part of the upper part of my arm. The arm is warm to the touch. I plan to go to a medical clinic tomorrow, as I am now, visiting my daughter and grandchildren, until January 24.

Around 30 minutes after getting the shot left side of face began to feel  a little prickly numbness which eased off so at 120 minutes after getting the shot left side of face felt mildly like it feels after dental visit numbness wears off.  That&#39;s about it.  This is recorded at around 120 minutes after getting the shot.  I am home and feel fine wasn&#39;t sure to report this or not but since experimental it may be of use.

(&#43;) dermatographia. Over the last week there has been some improvement but 2 new papules developed on L inner thigh and R upper arm. No treatment. as it didn&#39;t bother me enough. Saw my dermatologist yesterday for routine f/u and he confirmed that Dermatologists are seeing an urticarial rash 1-3 weeks after the vaccine.. The question is: should I get the second shot in a week?

                                                6 hours after injection I started itching all over, turning red, had a rash, my chest got tight, no difficulty breathing. I went to sleep and woke up very hot, some sweating. Had to get out from under the cover, cooled off in a few minutes. Eyes are burning, some redness, rash like on arms.

                                                Started with normal sore arm, ache, tired the day after.  These symptoms went on for a week.  Called Dr and they said they last longer in some people. By the week of the 11th my wife and I were both getting worse.  By Sunday morning, 1/10 we couldn?t get out of bed.  We tested positive for Covid around the 18th  My question is we are supposed to get our second vaccination on 2/3/21, a week from tomorrow.  Given the first vaccine, then testing positive for Covid, should we get the second shot as planned or should we try to delay a week or so to get more strength.  This report is identical for both my wife and myself.  Also, we mask, social distance, no restaurants, etc.  Thank you

On Wednesday I was better , but was still very fatigued and had mild headaches . By Thursday was back to normal.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the vaccination I begin to feel itching, burning sensation in my left wrist area surrounding the site of the surgery on Jan. 4 for skin cancer.  This increased over the next few hours and by the next morning my lower forearm was involved.  The surgical site was about 2 inches long, stitches had been removed ten days before and the wound was mostly healed.  The rash extended from the wound site toward the wrist about 2 inches, radiated laterally along the length of the wound about 2 inches on either side and up into the upper forearm another 3 inches.  There were small blisters within the rash as well.  I initially tried a cortisone cream I had left over from a previous wound.  This seemed to inflame the rash even more and I stopped.  I then applied some of the antibiotic cream I used when the wound was fresh and actively treated.  This seemed to reduce the inflammation some.  After 2 days I contacted my dermatologist who prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1 % External Cream.  I have been taking this for 24 hours, 3 applications and the rash is beginning to dissipate.  My dermatologist  indicated I was the third patient to have a rash on the same arm with a surgery and a Moderna shot, in the same arm.

                                                Patient came to the Health Department on afternoon of 2/12/21 to report incident.  He received the vaccine approximately 4:20pm.  According to the patient, he felt at his normal all evening.  At 9:15pm, he reports he started having chills and was very cold.  He rested with a blanket until he got up at 9:30pm to get a drink of water and check his temperature.  Per the patient, he remembers checking his temperature, which was 97.6F, then awoke on the floor.  He had passed out, believes he was &#34;out&#34; for no more than a minute.   Patient reports he felt well when he awoke and has felt at his baseline ever since.  He has abrasions to bilateral hands, as well as his chin.  His upper lip was busted.  He did not see his doctor in regards to this.  He admittedly does not see a doctor often.  Encouraged patient to follow up with is doctor, as he states he has a history of a stroke and heart attack.

                                                Patient developed a severe skin rash with hives involving 80% of his body 9 days after the vaccine was given.  Initally his feet were spared.  He had sores on his face, but no facial edema.  The rash has felt like an intense burn.  He has been on oxcarbazepine since Sept, 2013 without any history of rashes or adverse effects.  There were no other new factors other than eating a strawberry 7 days before the rash, and he does not normally eat them.   He was seen in urgent care and started on a prednisone taper, now at day #6 of 9, plus hydroxyzine.  Hives have resolved, but his skin still is erythematous and burns.

                                                Dear Sirs,  My family doctor suggested I contact you regarding my unusual side effect from the second Covid-19 injection I received recently.  History:  I am a 72 year old male.  I have high blood pressure treated with 25 mg Atenolol.  I have had repeated operations for skin cancer on my face and head.  I have had pre-cancerous polyps removed through my anus.  My doctor can provide a much more detailed history if required.  First Covid injection of Moderna:  This went well and the only side effect was a sore arm.  I only noticed it if I touched it, otherwise there was no pain.  It went away in a few days.  Second injection:  I was anticipating additional side effects after reading up on the subject.  I was not surprised when my arm hurt.  It was constant and worse than the first time, but not alarming.  I also had a headache which did not surprise me from the research I had done.  The headache felt like my brain had ballooned inside my head and was in compression.  It was uncomfortable, but not painful.     Now to the matter that concerned me:  I was unable to sleep.  This was not something I had read about anywhere in my research.  Being very tired and knowing how important sleep is I decided I should go to the Emergency Room of the local hospital to be looked at.  They told me that none of the doctors, nurses and technicians had ever heard of this effect.  A technician said he would do a world-wide research on the subject and get back to me.  3 hours later he said that he could find no reports on the subject.  They conducted blood and urine tests that they said returned results showing everything normal.  They told me that they did not want to prescribe sleeping drugs because they can be dangerous and were also concerned about any side effects that may result from interactions with the Covid injection that were unknown.   They suggested I talk to my family doctor and then released me.  After 40 hours (yes forty) of being awake I broke out in a profuse sweat.  I reduced the heat, removed clothing and put a fan on.  The next thing I was aware of was 4 hours later when I awoke from sleep.  The sweating had stopped and the headache had stopped.  Purpose:  I have two purposes for writing to you.  First, because my doctor had recommended it.  Second to offer myself as a research subject in the matter.  I recognize that the world is suffering terribly and is trying to understand everything about the pandemic in order to better deal with it on a continual basis.  To that end I recognize the value of research and want to help in some small way.  Thank you.

Only lasted for two or three minutes until I got back in bed and under the covers.  Same thing happened two nights later about the same time, but I never got out of bed then and it only lasted for a minute or so.  It was much less severe and was limited more to my upper body.  I was fine both times when I got up in the morning.

My lower back and right side started hurting the same night of vaccine, this morning it was worse and I was feeling like I wasn&#39;t going to make it. I still feel weak.  It was difficult for me for me to get out of bed this morning.

                                                My arm was mildly sore at  the injection site for about 36 hours.  2/18/21 (Thurs.) ? In the morning (only) there were rashes on my L arm, my neck and my back. While I have had a few itchy pimple areas for several weeks, and am generally sensitive to everything, this is not the same. It is also not the same as the transient flushing that I have in my face for a few minutes each morning after I take 500 mg. of Niacin.   2/23/21 (Tues.) ? At 8:30 a.m. I had flushing (not quite a noticeable rash) on my back, face, shoulders and both arms, esp. the L arm. (This was 20-30 minutes after I had taken Niacin, but the brief flushing, just in my face, resulting from the Niacin was long gone before these other rashes/flushing occurred.) Later, after 9:00 a.m., there was warmth and itching on my lower back. At 9:45 a.m. I felt flushing in my thighs and lower legs. At 10:00 a.m. there was an actual red rash on my chest and stomach. This all seems unusual for one week after the CoVID-19 shot.     2/27/21 (Sat.) ? Starting at 9:50 a.m. (30 minutes after taking 500 mg. of Niacin, which usually results in immediate flushing of my face, for only a few minutes at most), I had flushing and itching, and a slight rash, on my upper chest and upper back. After a few minutes the flushing and itching spread to my lower back, and my upper arms; my upper arms had a noticeable rash, which then spread down to my hands. In the next few minutes the flushing, itching and rash extended to my upper inner thighs and lower back (although I am only assuming, based on the feeling of flushing and itching, that my lower back had a rash, since I couldn?t see there). Over the next several minutes the itching and rash extended to the front and side of my thighs, down to my knees. The rash then extended, to a lesser extent, down to my ankles. As of 10:50 a.m. I still have this flushing, itching and/or rash in all the places mentioned, although it has started to decrease. This was mostly gone by 12:00 p.m. Other than 4 days ago, I don?t think I have previously experienced this generalized reaction in my 73 years.

She reported that patient, was hospitalized a week after getting his first injection and stayed in the hospital for 3 days. She states he presented with confusion, weakness, shakiness and was thought to originally have had a TIA and then was diagnosed with metabolic encephalopathy. She states he is completely different and now has to walk with a walker and confusion persists.

                                                In Temporary VAERS E-Report Number 325084, I previously reported whole-body flushing, itching and rashes in the mornings 2 days, 7 days and 11 days after receiving my first Moderna CoVID-19 vaccination on 2/16/21. I now have another incident to report, occurring 16 days after the vaccination.    3/04/21 (Thurs.) ? Starting at 8:20 a.m. (20 minutes after taking 500 mg. of Niacin, which usually results in some immediate flushing of my face, for only a few minutes at most), I had flushing and itching, and a slight rash, on my upper chest. At 8:25 a.m. both arms were red, particularly on the inside of my elbows, as well as my shoulders. At 8:30 .am. my stomach was red and itching. At 8:35 a.m. I had itching and redness on my lower back and inner thighs. (Since I was just adding areas, without the previous areas of flushing, itching and rash going away, going away, my arms were now the reddest of any areas.) At 8:40 a.m. the redness and itching extended to the front of my legs, down to the shin, as well as my lower back. At 8:50 a.m. (by which time I was in a supermarket, without much chance to look at areas under my clothes for redness), the back of my hands were very red, and to a lesser extent my palms. At 9:00 a.m., the overall itching had increased further. At 9:10 a.m., my cheeks and the back of my neck felt flushed and itching. At 9:20 a.m., by which time I was home, my abdomen was very red and itching. At 9:50 a.m., I still had itching all over, esp. my abdomen. By 10:20 a.m. there was a decrease in overall itching and flushing. By 11:20 a.m. they were mostly gone, except for some itching in the small of my back. Today is 16 days after I had my first Moderna vaccination. I have never before experienced this overall reaction to anything, other than 2 days, 7 days and 11 days after the vaccination.

On 3/5/21 at 3:00 am woke from sleep with extreme chills, goosebumps on the skin, and physically shaking to warm up. I had on the bed a sheet, quilt, and heavy comforter. I used the toilet to urinate and was not sure that I could walk back to my bed due to nausea and weakness. After resting, I placed another wool blanket on the bed on top of the comforter. Eventually, I began to warm up. Nausea and fever continued.  Muscles and joints ached. I slept on and off until 7:00 am. I did not eat any breakfast due to continuing nausea. I drank coffee, sat in my reclining chair most of the morning. at 12:00 noon, I ate a bowl of potatte and chicken soup.  My tempereature at this time was 99.5. I did sleep in the afternoon. Later in the evening my temperture had gone down to 99.  Today, 3/06/21 at 8:00am, I feel normal, tired but normal.

                                                Primarily, extremely weak on the next day--in particular for several hours during the afternoon in which I lay down and did not wish to move.  Soreness and aching throughout my body, not unlike when one experiences influenza; however, I had no other flu symptoms, no nausea or indigestion.  There were occasional headaches, and a few times, light-headedness.  Weariness, and lack of physical drive continued, on and off, for another ten days.  On one day, one week later, during this period, I was able to function fairly normally, but I may have over-extended..  The next day, Friday, the weakness resumed.  Last night when I went to bed, I felt light-headed again, but slept soundly for seven hours.  Today, I feel much better, and I feel that I am returning to normal.

Felt like I had been hit by that truck everybody gets hit by. Fever broke some time during the night.  Pain subsided. Was able to eat breakfast about 9AM.  Very weak. Dozed on and off the rest of the morning.  Low grade fever most of the rest of the day. By Sunday morning felt pretty much normal, but still weak. By Monday morning pretty much back to normal.

I don&#39;t remember when exactly the fever started, but it last until the 36th hour after the vaccination.  It was 101.3 most of the time.  101.7 was the high point.  I also had stomach pain at that time.  After 3 days I was fine.  With the 1st shot I also had a sore arm, but not this bad.  I also ran a fever, but it was around 100 then.

Also had some abdominal cramping, which I often have due to colitis so probably unrelated to vaccine. Treated fever with acetaminophen at about 2 p.m., temperature went down to 98.7 but continued to have chills most of afternoon. Second morning after vaccination still have chills but milder. Temperature of 98.7 in morning. Not medicated.

He began falling over in the chair and seemed very pale. His wife was with him and myself and two customers in the store were helping to keep him awake. 911 was called and did arrive. He was barely speaking at first and then when he was given oxygen by 911 he began to come to. His wife was stating that he had not eaten today. Paramedics took him to the hospital, he was awake and conscious when they took him.

                                                Got the vaccine and had soreness in the arm and felt great, and on Saturday 3/6/21 late afternoon his head hurt to touch his hair.  He knew what it was from previous experience.  Was on the top of his head to the right rear predominantly, probably 4&#34; or so.  It was painful and tied into his right eye as he was photophobic with this as well and sunlight would affect that and would get a spasm of pain/2 second or so in the top of his head.  These events continued intermittently until Tuesday 3/9/21 when it was gone, but on his right tricep has a scraping sore feeling on it, which still continues as of today 3/16/21, but only faintly.

Went to the doctor at a walk in clinic on 02/24/21 because I had high fever and nausea and weakness for about 10 hours. I got an infected tooth(root canal and crown on this tooth) and an infected jaw. Dentist put me on antibiotics and I have to have the tooth pulled. I went to the dentist on 02/11/2021.

                                                Besides expected head ache and slight fatigue, I woke up on the night of 3/17 (day 2 following 2nd vaccine dose) with extreme pain in my right big toe and foot, with some cramping in the right calf.  It was difficult to walk.  I stayed in bed most of the next day with right leg elevated, and using ice to help pain and swelling. My wife and I suspected Gout, however it would have been a first for me to have it.  By 3/19 it felt a little better, but right foot still swollen, and my wife and I noticed a pronounced vein from the right knee down. She got scared that it could be a blood clot, so we called Dr and he ordered ultra sound, which was done on 3/19 in afternoon, but technician said that saw &#34;nothing&#34;.  Today (3/20) foot still sore and it&#39;s hard to put wight on it still.

                                                Numbness in lower lip and numbness and slight trembling in right side of face (similar to Bells Palsy?) after four days of being administered the first shot in the right arm. After a video consult with my PCP it was recommended that I go to the hospital and get a CT scan to rule out a possible minor stroke. The CT scan was negative. The numbness became better after two weeks but has not subsided.  After consultation with the doctor in charge of the vaccine operation for the site it was decided that I go ahead and take the second shot but instead of the right arm I should take it in either the left arm or the left thigh. The second shot was administered in the left thigh. I experienced the typical symptoms on the second day - fever, chills and aches and pain but they went away towards the end of the second day. However, exactly on the fourth day I experienced increased numbness in my lower lip and on the right side of my face. Today is the fifth day and it is still there. I expect that this numbness will continue for several weeks as it did with the first shot and so far it has not subsided after the first shot and has now increased after the second shot. I am totally convinced that this is a direct result of the vaccine.

He had a clot in his brain and underwent brain surgery. He experienced seizures after the surgery, but it was ultimately reported the surgery went well. He remained intubated and on a ventilator after surgery. He developed complications of his lungs and kidneys while on the ventilator. Ventilator was removed 3/16/2021 and he passed away that day. The hospital providers thought the clot in the brain may have been from hitting his head over a month ago. From my understanding he was A&amp;O, independent with ADLs, and lived in his private residence prior to these complications.

                                                Patient was found deceased in his own home on Monday, March 15, 2021.  He was found on the floor in a sitting position with three fingers of his right hand on his right carotid.  It appeared that he was getting ready for church, which was a routine event.  Although patient was a diabetic, he never had episodes that were life threatening, and was always able to manage to remediate with insulin or food.  Patient last spoke to a neighbor at 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, March 14th, who said he appeared to be just fine and they scheduled a date with their dogs on Sunday afternoon.  A sheet of instructions found on the kitchen counter at the home informed us that he had a COVID vaccine at the VA Hospital on Wednesday, March 10th.  He was documenting side-effects of very sore  right arm and low blood sugars.  that was unusual because if he was able to manage he wouldn&#39;t have noted it.  It was apparent that something sudden happened such that he was unable to get to help and his heart rate must have been of concern.  We believe that patient suffered  onset of some sort of cardiac event, blood clot, high heart rate, or heart attack, that was associated with the vaccine on Wednesday and 4 days later he was suddenly gone, unable to call for help (he has family close by in this community).  We want healthcare providers and individuals to be able to make informed decisions about giving/taking the vaccine when there is another health issue  such as diabetes to consider.  We lost a brother, a father, a friend and a dedicated veteran unnecessarily.

This continued, especially the weakness and muscle aches and chills for 10 days.  Then I began to have diarrhea, stomach ache and of course, continuation of weakness.  Basically, I feel pretty crappy and have not gotten back to my normal self before the 2nd shot.  I have no temp, no sore throat, no cough.  It is hard to do anything although I did accompany my wife grocery shopping but sat in the car part of the time.

                                                Evening of 3 March 2021 around 7 pm started to feel chills with fever and cold sweets. Left arm beginning to feel very sore at injection site. Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous. Next is very hard to describe, my wife and daughter found me passed out on the kitchen floor. This lasted approximately 20 minutes until EMT arrived. I do not remember anything from that point. EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

                                                On 3/14/21, I started to experience some mild pain in my left knee and thigh.  By the end of the day, I had some fairly extreme pain in my left thigh and knee.  I have a orthopedic implant screwed into my left femur.  The pain level was about a 8 out of 10.  It was barely tolerable and seemed to mitigate over the next 7 days.  I still today have a pain level of about 2 out of 10 that I treat with an NSAID.  My knee is still sore.  No orthopedic implant in this knee however.

She was fine after about a day.  My father reported  arm soreness and fatigue that lasted about three days after the shot.  He thought he was rebounding from the shot and continued his usual activities.  Though, he started complaining of being &#34;winded&#34; and difficulty breathing.  He slept a lot and continued with fatigue and shallow breathing.  A week after his shot he felt he needed to go to the ER because of difficulty breathing and being exhausted after walking up a flight of stairs (we live in a raised ranch style house).

Strangely my right hand was frozen open.  Was unable to make a fist or grasp a water bottle.  When I tried to close my right hand I had a weird sensation in my hand.  It felt like electricity flowing down my hand and into my 4 fingers.  Left hand was not effected.   Had the same effect when I woke up a couple times during the night.  When I got up on Saturday morning the problem with my hand was gone.  Still a bit stiff, was fatigued, headache and body aches.  Sore arm for a few days.

Pt. only has muscle function in the right side of his body due to his stroke damage. His wife immediately approached him in his chair and asked him what was wrong and all he was able to state was &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; before loosing consciousness and stopping breathing. 911 was immediately called and due to his wife being frail herself she was not able to remove him from his wheelchair to perform any CPR. EMS arrived and begin performing CPR until the DNR papers for pt. were located. Medical examiner came to the home and stated she did not feel that an autopsy was needed even though family had told her NUMEROUS times that pt. had received his second Covid vaccine the day prior. He was pronounced dead by the medical examiner and taken directly to the funeral home due to the DNR papers being present.

Minimal pain in both arms for next five weeks.   6 weeks after 2nd dose was administered on the night of April 18th, I woke with both shoulders severely aching and I had inflammation and pain all over my body. It is approx.5 weeks later since the pain became severe and I am presently trying to manage it with Tylenol and have no ides how to approach getting treatment.  My shoulders have extreme pain when I use my arms.  Body feels inflamed/sore constantly and restricts my daily activities.

He had 2 MRIs which concluded he has an infection in the bone of one of his toes. He was sent home after 5 days in the hospital with a PIC line where he has to be on 2 antibiotics and a blood thinner for 6 weeks. If infection doesn&#39;t resolve he will have to have toe amputated. Prior to Covid vaccines my father was very active and healthy. He could do things without distress. He can now barely walk too far because he is so weak.

                                                I had a severe reaction to the first shot.  I had Covid in Dec 2019 before it was suppose to be here.  Last summer I developed a bad reaction to bee stings.  After the first Covid shot I felt my whole body tingling after about ten minutes.  I gave myself epicenter shot when I got to my truck.  The next morning after breakfast I threw up and slept for about 6 hours.  The severe tingling in hands, feet, and necklace and face woke me up.  I gave myself a second epipen shot within 30 hours.    I called my doctor to have epipens refilled.  He told me I should have gone to hospital the next day for fluids.  My doctor told me not to take the second shot for the possibility of three days in hospital for fluids, chance of lung or brain injury or the most drastic reaction could be I would have a fatal anaphalegic reaction.  For these reasons I called to cancel my second appointment

                                                MY REACTION TO THE FIRST DOSE: In March of 2020 I suffered Covid pneumonia and was on oxygen and too weak and short of breath to work for three months.  It took over seven months to return my breathing and strength to baseline. I just checked my lab and I still have IgG antibodies and a negative nasal screen for the virus. One month ago at 9 AM I received the Moderna Vaccine.  About 12 hours later I developed shaking chills and a fever of about 103, pain in my arm from the injection, and severe cough and a VERY WATERY RUNNY NOSE with severe post nasal drip which caused aspiration of the discharge.   I took Tylenol, Afrin Nasal Spray, and a Dulera inhaler and fell asleep.  I woke up at 3 AM and felt well, but at 4 AM I developed an intolerable intractable cough and severe watery nasal discharge lasting about two hours and severe dry heaves from the aspiration.  Afrin nasal spray helped somewhat but I was absolutely miserable for  two hours.    Three days ago I received the one month booster for the Moderna Vaccine at 10AM.   My arm began to become painful but it was tolerable and not relieved by Tylenol. Every time I rolled over at night the pain woke me up but I was able to tolerate it.  Yesterday I woke up with severe constant chills but my temperature was normal.  I felt very hungry and diaphoretic and felt like I had a low blood sugar,  and ate a bowl of rice chex cereal. I felt a little better but a half hour later VOMITED everything up.  I then felt somewhat better and went to the hospital to make rounds.  The nursing staff reported that about half of them called in sick due to the vaccine with severe fatigue, fever, joint pains and headaches.  One nurse reported that all her joints felt like they were on fire.  Four nursing supervisors also called in sick that day.   I then went to my office and my staff said I looked GREEN and insisted I go home.  I did not eat anything but while resting I again had SEVERE VOMITING of my breakfast at about noon.  When I felt stronger I drove home at about 1:30 PM and fell asleep until about 5 PM, still not having eaten anything nor taking fluids. My arm pain went away.  By 7 PM I finally drank some tea and felt stronger and felt like I was not going to die.   It seems that those of use who had the Covid in the past do not tolerate the vaccine and suffer severe reactions. I was unable to find any studies with the vaccine given to patients who already have antibodies.  This lack of data is a real problem.

There was increase in local temp with severe pruritis and induration. The rash gradually spread and later diminished in size.  There is still erythema and occasional pruritis and a small area of induration which is tender on palpation approximately 3 finger widths proximal to my elbow on the lateral left arm. No other systemic manifestations are noted.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  I received a Moderna covid-19 vaccination (Lot # 007M20A)  at 10:20 AM on Monday 02-01-2021 at the VA Clinic .  Between 3 and 4 minutes later I began to experience difficulty breathing, sweating and feeling warm, and then I passed out behind the steering wheel of my parked car, while sitting with my wife.  I came to after few minutes as people were attempting to get me out of my car and into a wheelchair, but I had difficulty breathing, couldn?t move, and had to be pulled out.  After being put in the wheelchair, I passed out again and came to after I had been taken out of the wheelchair and laid on my left side on the ground by Fire Dept. EMT?s.  I then began to retch, but did not vomit.   My wife said that one of the EMT?s pumped my chest a couple of times. They lifted me onto a gurney and put me in an ambulance, hit me with an EPI pen, and placed an oxygen mask on my face, as I was having great difficulty breathing.  I was unable to move or lift my arms to help them place a blood pressure cuff on my arm, a pulse monitor on my finger, and lift my shirt to help them attach EKG pads. Atthat point I realized that I had also lost control of my bladder at some point. I continued to have difficulty breathing, and started to experience extreme shivering all the while to emergency Room. Once in the Emergency Room, I could not move myself off the FD gurney, and they had to lift the sheet that I was laying on in order to move me onto the hospital gurney. I had great difficulty helping the technicians remove my shirt so that they could administer another EKG and start an IV (LR 1,000ml bolus).   I continued to have difficulty breathing and kept shivering and sweating for some time.  I was advised that the EKG?s both appeared normal.  After a lengthy period of I gradually reached a point where I stopped shivering and sweating, and returned to almost normal breathing.  I was finally released around 1-1:30 PM.

Client states BP kept climbing so went to the ambulance station.  Client states at the ambulance BP was around 215/100&gt;  Was taken to Hospital per ambulance the evening of 2/5/2021.  Note:  Client was on Amlodipine until 1/26/2021 when it was discontinued.  There is a question if the BP elevation was related to the discontinuation of the Amlodipine or the vaccination with Moderna.

                                                After receiving the vaccination her husband met with his son.  He reported that his dad did not know anything.  His wife told the son to bring him to Hospital.  They brought him to the hospital and got there and his son said that he had called the daughter and he did not know the day, month, his grandson&#39;s name, like he wasn&#39;t there.  He had a funny look on his face that he was &#34;out of it&#34;.  Asked simple questions about pet at home, favorite and could not remember the name of the cat.  He then came out and said that he was fine. They ran tests for a mini-stroke, CT scan, blood work.  They had a consult with Neurology, virtual.  The neurologist did some questioning, and by 3:00 they felt that it was like a mini-stroke, and she said that she felt it was from the vaccination as it occurred right after the vaccine.  She took him home, and told him to take a nap.  By 4:30 PM she woke him up and said that they were going to eat, she was getting things ready.  He was sitting on the couch about 5:00 PM and had that blank stare again.  He went walking through the house walking aimlessly and started fumbling through papers .  She called 9-1-1 and within 10 minutes they took him to the ER.  It took her an hour to get to the hospital, his daughter met them at the ER.  He told them that he was fine, and they knew that he was not.  By 7:00 PM they were going to do an MRI and wanted to admit him to the hospital.  All of a sudden at 9:00 he was having another episode.  She got the nurse and they watched him and decided that he was having a seizure, (agitation, not making sense.).  The entire episode lasts for about 30 minutes.  They did an MRI and an EEG, which she does not have the results of.   On 2/11/21 she talked to the neurologist who insisted it was due to the vaccine.  He has now settled down and has not had another seizure since 9:00 PM the night before.   He was discharged yesterday at around 1:00 PM, he slept, got up and is fine this morning.  He was diagnosed with seizures, and to FU with Dr. in Epilepsy clinic, and prescribed Keppra, which he has not taken as he feels it was due to the vaccination..   He does not remember the events that took place.

When I arose at 10 AM, my left arm was swollen and throbbing with pain. I took Aleve with breakfast and that helped the pain, but not the swelling. However, this morning, 2-15-21, I noticed hives in the crook of both elbows and on my chest under both pectoral muscles. The hives don&#39;t itch or cause any discomfort except for causing some anxiety due to the fact that I haven&#39;t heard of hives being  mentioned as a side effect of the vaccine.

                                                Transverse myelitis with GAD enhancing lesion on MRI C3-C5. Strength was 5/5 symmetrically in the lower extremities, but he had significant weakness in the upper extremities left worse than right. Generally 4-/5 proximally on the right, 4/5 distally; left deltoid, biceps, triceps were 2-3/5, 4-/5 at the wrist and hand.

                                                Pain in arm developed after several days. Pain continuing through today 2/24/2021. Soreness in arm not mediated by pain meds, including Tramadol 50 MG that I take for back problems. Injection site was never red nor swollen. Trouble lifting arm without pain. Limited mobility without pain. On scale of 1 to 10 with ten being worst, pain varies between 3 and 7 at times.  Also have developed partially uncontrolled high blood pressure not mediated by heart meds, chiefly losartan. Before first vaccine, I was taking 50 mg daily. Increased to 100 mg daily on 2/1/2021 without stabalizing BP. BP can range during day from 106/60 to 158/86 with Pulse in 60s.

                                                Seizures; Mini stroke; Tired; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 73-year-old male who received Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced seizures, mini stroke, confused, agitated, eyes were abnormal, memory impairment, and tired.   The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack and stent placement in 2011. His relevant concomitant medications include acetylsalicylic acid, candesartan cilexetil, clopidogrel bisulfate, diltiazem hydrochloride, ezetimibe, adenosine, gabapentin, metoprolol tartrate and rosuvastatin calcium.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on 14 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, 30 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot#010M20A) intramuscularly in left deltoid for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Feb 2021, With in 30 minutes of receiving the vaccination, the patient had a seizure. They took him to the hospital, where he had a computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood work and had a consult. After consult, they said, it&#39;s a mini stroke. They released him and told her if it happens again call 911. He felt so tired and went to sleep at home. Around 17:00 dinner time, he woke up looked very blankly, and his wife reported knowing he had another seizure. She reported he ran to his keys saying, &#34;I have to go&#34;, seemed confused, agitated and didn&#39;t know where he was. She called 911 andhe was transported to the hospital in an ambulance.  Around 19:00 the same day, he was admitted to do scans overnight. Around 21:00, patient&#39;s eyes were abnormal, he became agitated again and nurses confirmed he was having another seizure. 30 minutes later, he was talking to his wife and daughter as if he didn&#39;t remember anything. He mentioned some metallic taste in his mouth.  On 11 Feb 2021, they did an electroencephalogram (EEG) and confirmed that he was having seizure. He was prescribed seizure medication and released him from hospital. However, the patient and his wife reported not wanting him to take the medication as they believe the events were due to the vaccine. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with vaccine is not applicable as the patient received both the doses.  The outcomes of the events, seizures, mini stroke, and tired, were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack and concomitant medication use can be confounding factor. Further information has been requested.

Neck pain that goes down my arm (R), extreme fatigue and achy. I&#39;ve lost 5lbs in 3d.&#39; MEDS UTD  History of Present Illness     &#34;I had that COVID shot Thursday (l arm).  Friday I started having cramps in my neck--base of my skull, R arm, into the base of my jaw.&#34;  Worse with laying down, sleeping on L side.  &#34;Hurt too much to get up&#34; (had wife help him up to bathroom).    Tried?  Bayer back and body only.  Tried some topical ben gay (made worse), vibration therapy.  Hot shower seemed to help.  Review of Systems     &#43; for chills, HA, diarrhea.  Worst yesterday.  Missed work yesterday.  Had been eating/drinking well until recently.    Assessment/Plan      1. Adverse reaction to vaccine T50.Z95A    2. Myalgia after COVID-19 vaccination M79.10     1.  Adverse vaccine response will be reported.  This seems to be fairly significant due to being 5d after.  2.  Will try Tyl 1000mg up to tid and Ibu 400 up to tid-qid for next 3 days--try to get dose of each at hs tonight.  Push fluids.  Prednisone 20mg/d x 5d.  Call report tomorrow on status.  3.  At this time, will likely avoid 2nd Moderna covid vax in this pt due to reaction.  4.  Note provided for off work yesterday through tomorrow.

                                                Woke up from sleep with sharp pain in upper right arm just above elbow on same arm that  Covid vaccine was injected.  After getting up also had pain in right palm just below base of thumb.  The pain seemed more like nerve pain.  Pain is not continuous, but just comes on suddenly whether I am moving arm or not.  The pain has lasted all day.  I have taken two ibuprofen tablets so far today.

He has also experienced pain in his chest pain (unclear if muscle pain).  He is still experiencing discomfort.    Has lost weight. Then got a little better for 2 days, then lost appetite and unable to get out of bed.  Then arm and legs swollen on 3/9/2021 but swelling has gone down today. He is conscious but is having a hard time getting out of bed and has no energy.

                                                History of Present Illness  The patient presents with weakness.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is generalized.  The degree at present is moderate.  Associated symptoms: abdominal pain.  73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. PT states that he was feeling well until after he went to bed tonight. around 1 am he attempted to get up and go to the bathroom and his wife had to help him. She was able to get him up and he went to the bathroom but he seemed more shakey than usual. He then tried to get back up around 230 am and he was very shakey, said he was cold, and he could tno stand. She attempted to stand him up and she was not able to get him up and move him at all because he was so generally weak. No fevers that he knows of. He did recieve his first dose of the covid vaccine this afternoon. He was well after that and went to dinner and was well until he went to sleep. He has a h/o HTN, HLD, and tremor. Pt did have covid in early december as well. .    Notes: 73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. Pt is alert and awake but slower to respond than his usual per his wife. Labs are overall reassuring. His etemp is elevated but afebrile. CXR with possible atelectasis vs infiltrate but pt has no cough, no fever, and a normal WBC Coutn so I favor atelectasis. His CT head shows possibly artifact vs cortical hypodensities. Will await formal read this morning. Pts UA is clean. He is no longer shaking after a dose of tylenol and ativan. I suspect the pts generalzied weakess is 2/2 his recent covid vaccine yesterday afternoon. Despite this the pt cannot stand and move around on his own and his wife cannot care fo rhim at home given his current situation. Pt discussed with Dr and will be admitted for further care. .

                                                Immediate recurrence of GBS post vaccination.  This time around on Tuesday pt got a COVID vaccine and 6 hours after pt started feeling nauseous and 3 days after the vaccine had numbness in his feet b/l at first. Numbness travelled upwards up to the knees. Next the weakness started extending upwards to his mid thigh. Pt will not put any weight on his legs because he knows he is very unsteady.  Today he has numbness in his hands b/l. Pt had no symptoms before Tuesday. He lives at home (independent senior facility) and is coming from there. Pt woke up this morning and went from his bed to his chair and since then pt was not able to get up from the chair.

                                                #1 The 2nd injection was March 6 at noon.  #2 On March 8 at 8:15 AM  I had a sudden burning on my forehead and within one minute this burning covered my body leaving most of the skin area red in color. I also quivered lightly for about 30 minutes. The painful burning and discoloration began fading at two hours and was mostly gone by the third hour. #3 On March 9 at 11:20 AM the same event reoccurred, exactly as the previous day. #4 On March 14 at 8:30 AM I had the third attack, which was similar to the first two. #5 I would not call this a rash. It did not itch. There was a burning, buzzing feeling. I did not touch my skin. I called many phone numbers to see if I should take a Benadryl tablet, but none of the numbers we knew or were given provided any medical expertise. #6 We have photographs on these events.

I remained feeling tired and weak until about noon the following day.  Now I feel fine and my blood pressure has been back to between 120-140/70-80.  Am feeling good at this time.

Pain has continued for 3 weeks transitioning to a sharper pain (approximately 5 on a scale 1 to 10) and distinct loss of strength when raising the arm as it approaches shoulder height.   Difficulty in holding heavier objects (a full water pitcher) steady, even with the arm bent at waist level.  Pain and loss of function persist today as I am writing this report.

                                                Patient started feeling woozy, dizzy, slurring words and fatigued around 11:30am. By the afternoon he was extremely fatigued and barely ate lunch or dinner. He went to bed at 9:30pm. By 1:30am, he woke up and urinated the bed because he couldn&#39;t get his urinal in place. He was extremely weak and shaking, and could barely hold his body upright when I used the lift to get him out of bed. He was not making coherent sense when he spoke, though his words and sentences were sensical, it made no sense in context.  We sent him to the ER on recommendation of the advice nurse and 4:30am. He was checked in and showed low levels of sodium and potassium. They gave him an IV and he began to feel better very soon, though he remained weak and woozy and nauseous.  He returned home in early afternoon, but remained weak for over 2 weeks afterward, slurring words and having trouble lifting his arms, though mental  function returned by that same day. The doctors believe that he had a TIA, though no evidence of a clot showed up. They did discover that he has atrial fibrillation, though they had never detected that before on the heart exams following his heart attack.

As the rash spread across my chest (left side) and blisters appeared, I went to my physician&#39;s office on March 9. Dr. diagnosed &#34;shingles&#34; and recommended OTC meds for pain and itching. In following weeks, the rash started healing, but the pain persisted which was not relieved by Tylenol or other OTC drugs. I could not sleep, and with strong pain and upset stomach went to the ER on Sat. March 27, I was seen. I was treated at ER for pain and nausea; Gabapentin was prescribed for nerve pain.

                                                Patient woke up around 3:30am feeling extremely nauseous, shaking, drenched in sweat but with a normal temperature (97.6, which is normal for him), and feeling overall terrible.  Food had tasted weird to him the day before, but he still ate. At 3:30am, he felt like he was having a major allergy attack - lots of phlegm, runny nose and eyes. He spit up a lot of thick phlegm (which can be normal for him, due to IBM). After 15 mins, the sweat and shaking died down, and he felt better enough to think about going to sleep. But 5 minutes later, the nausea returned, and he threw up about 25 mL of black &#34;coffee grounds-like&#34; fluid. (The smell was HORRIBLE). After getting through with that (about 15 minutes), he wretched up more thick mucus with a few flecks of black cells in it. After awhile, he felt okay enough to go back to sleep.  Around 6am, he had another major allergy-like attack, but did not vomit.  Around 8am, after being awake for awhile, he vomited again with more black liquid, about 50mL this time. He felt weak and horrible and was shaking. At the recommendation of the advice nurse, he was taken to the ER by ambulance. Upon arriving, he waited around an hour for an ER bed.  They put him on an IV, did a physical inspection and did blood work. His sodium was a bit low, but in normal range. Potassium levels were fine. He was mentally clear the whole time, but physically very weak.  He was kept overnight after a hemochrit test in the afternoon showed low levels of hemoglobin. He was stabilized in the morning, but was barely able to eat anything the whole time. He was meant to get an endoscopy, but they decided to allow him to eat and sent him home after noon bc they hadn&#39;t yet been able to schedule him for it and he was in pain and massively hungry.  When he got home, he still barely ate,  and still isn&#39;t eating almost anything a day later. His stool was incredibly black and thick and SMELLY immediately upon arriving home (he had not defecated for 48 hours at that point), and he has not been able to defecate since, which is extremely abnormal (he usually goes each day in the morning upon waking).  They believe that he may have bleeding in his stomach or upper GI or esophagus, but we are waiting for an endoscopy later this week.  He is still very weak and frail and fatigued.

At some point during the night he wound up on the floor and eventually yelled for help. He was unable to get up by himself and was down there for an unknown amount of time. His spouse believes a few hours. He then continued the same symptoms and wife gave him crackers, sprite and fluids. He slept Saturday night in his recliner, He was still unwell Sunday morning so she called an ambulance who took him to ER. He was then sent to another hospital.  Initially thought he had kidney and liver failure as well as heart attack but she states the muscle damage is what cause the labs to look similar to a heart attack and his kidneys and liver were trying to expel toxins/waste from muscle damage and he was very dehydrated. His liver and kidneys recovered  in about 2 or 3 days and he received IVF and  spent 7 days at the hospital and is still in Rehab recovering.

Slept for about and hour. Awoke and felt I had to go to the bathroom - I could not feel or move my legs. Finally used my arms to swing legs over edge of sofa but could not feel or use them. I used the my arms to lift myself to standing position and lost control of bladder - not and accident - felt it totally empty at once. Feeling started to return to legs and I was able to walk to clean myself up. Slowly began to regain use of legs and to stop shuffling and dragging my feet. I was doing better by 6:00p.m. and the leg problem was almost gone the next day. No repeat of the bladder issue.

About 10 days after second dose hallucinations (?); 5:00 am got up, dressed, and walked downstairs asking if I had called the police, because he said I had told him to get up and come downstairs so I could call them.  There were not problems needing the police.  We took it as a very real dream and he went back to bed.  Over the next few weeks, he experienced weakness and dizziness/vertigo  causing three falls.  Went to primary care physician who prescribed Antivert and is sending him for a CAT scan and to a neurologist for further evaluation (vestibuar neuritis?  labyrinthitis?).

I also noticed that my face was flushed and I experienced some light-headedness, which I reported to my care giver.  After being monitored for an hour with improved symptoms, I was discharged.  Subsequently, on April 8, 2021, I noticed pain, tenderness, slight redness, and itching at the injection site.  Contacted my caregiver and was told to take Benadryl and apply a cold compress to the site.  I also treated it with Cortaid.  Symptoms cleared up within 48 hours and have not recurred.

                                                I received my first shot of Moderna vaccine on February 12 and my second on March 12, 2001. I experienced very slight reactions to both injections composed of mild aching, and tingling sensation of shoulders and back and very slight soreness at the injection sight and lasting only 24 hours after the injections.  On evening of May 24, 2021, I experienced a very upset stomach followed by multiple bowel movements during the night and intense aching of the joints, fatigue, tingling sensation of my back and shoulders, chills and loss of appetite lasting through the following day and night.  I awoke on May 25, 2021 feeling better but still experiencing slight fatigue and a mild head ache.  During these days both my wife and I consumed the same foods and carried out identical schedules.  My question is: could this have been a delayed reaction to the Moderna vaccine?

                                                The main complaint is injection site soreness that has not gone away and affects normal range of motion of my left arm particularly when raising my arm above my head or pressing down on my left arm, although the tenderness and often pain has been continuous since receiving the second shot.  Secondary to that is a day of mental confusion one week out from the injection after each shot.

                                                Serious skin rash over much of my body: face, trunk, arms, scalp, groin and neck. The most serious and troubling area is around the neck where t-shirt collar contacts the skin. Some areas don&#39;t itch, but the head and neck do. Facial areas that are normally oily are now very dry, scaling and itching. Pre-existing skin problems are now heavily exaggerated. Dry areas on the fingers are worse. Dandruff is much worse. First noticed as an irritation around the eyes. Tears were burning my face, as if acidified. Then I noticed the rash on my arms. Further inspection revealed it on my face, neck, trunk and groin area. There is dryness, scaling and flaking around the eyes, nose, mouth and ears. The neck is most troubling with heat, itching and burning causing lack of sleep. It is not abating and appears to be getting worse. I will be seeking medical attention for the first time this week. If this is related to the vaccine, I want to make that known. I had the second of two shots on the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (lot #047B21A), on May 07 at noon, meaning I was fully antibody protected on 05-21, immediately before the rash was noticed. A bad body rash is associated with this vaccine, but I find no documentation that it has been observed this long after vaccination. Just the same, I am reporting this today in part because I want this to be documented as a possible reaction to the vaccine. Other possible causes have been ruled out. Currently taking Benadryl, NSAIDS, moisturizing cream, and hydrocortisone cream.

                                                I got sick. I went to the gym after receiving the vaccine, and I didn&#39;t feel well. In the afternoon I began sweating profusely. The next morning I tried going to bathroom, but I was weak so I fell and hit my head. I landed hard on my back which resulted in severe back pain. I was taken to the ER and stayed 10 days in there. I was then transferred to a different hospital for 10 more days. I was under home health care for 5 weeks. I went to rehab center  because I was weak from side effects of Covid vaccine. I received physical and speech therapy. 4 months later, I am still under medical care receiving physical therapy under my neurologist. My neurologist referred me to  Clinic for follow up on June 24, 2021.

Wednesday 1/6/21 swelling had spread significantly to inside the right side of mouth and tongue also affecting right jaw. By 3 Pm that day my tongue was numb and swollen on the right side as well as the right side of my mouth and jaw. I could only chew, eat, and swallow effectively on the left side of my mouth using the left side of my tongue to negotiate eating.  I could only this with small amounts of food. By that evening about 4 hours later I could eat , chew etc. pretty good but the swelling &amp; discomfort remained but reduced to a functional level.  Today, Thursday 1/7/21, the soreness and discomfort remains inside throat, mouth, tongue and jaw all on the right side.

Stayed in the pharmacy for about 45 minutes. Felt the breathing difficulty going away so decided to drive home. The breathing difficulty came back when I reached home (a 5-minute drive).  Feel asleep; woke up after about an hour and the breathing difficulty is completely gone. Have not felt it again until this report date (1/22/21 1:16am).

On Monday 1/25 both legs were much better and both finally cleared up on 1/27.

                                                I have chronic afib but have not had an episode in several years.  My pulse is usually around 100.  Within hours of receiving the vaccine, my fingertips went cold and the pulse/ox gave me a pulse of 122.  This continued for several hours and restarted again the next day.  As of this writing,1600 MT 2/1/21, the effect is not noticeable.  Injection site pain is still noticeable 2 days post-injection.

Forgot what I was working on at my golf lesson 9am that morning. Had written it down but forgot that too. Memory of events came back later on that night, about 3-4 hours after the shot. Received shot in left arm get tingling feeling in left hand. Happens 1-3 times a day (always when waking up in the morning) and goes away once i shake my arm.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

Symptoms lessened substantially about 15 hours after the vaccination, but continued at much lower levels for 24 hours after that.   Please note: I didn&#39;t know I needed prior vaccine information when I went for the Covid19 vaccine.  I thought it was 14&#43; days since my dose 2 pneumonia vaccine, but I later looked it up and found it had been 10 days.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. On the morning of 02/17 at 04:20 I woke up with chills and muscle cramps that felt just like the flu. One additional symptom was muscle spasms in my upper back between the shoulder blades. This experience I had never had before. Now that it has been 7 days after the vaccine; all the after effects were gone after the second day. All is well. Thank you.

                                                Initially I had the pain in the arm which I anticipated.  Several hours later I noticed that I had flu like symptons and my bones seemed to be painful.  Eventually I began having intermittent rapid heart beat.  I thought this may have been induced by tea (caffeine).  This rapid heart beat lasted until Monday (Feb. 15) I think.  As I mentioned it was intermittent.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

Thereafter I have no recollection of the rest of the day till about 10:15 pm when my wife took me to bed. During the afternoon I called my sister &amp; sent her a garbled text. I tried to talk to my wife but couldn&#39;t get the words out &amp; didn&#39;t know  how to ask for what I wanted. I had a dazed look.  I have absolutely NO recollection of any of this. slept well that night. The next day Feb 27th I woke feeling largely improved, not feverish &amp; still a bit heavy headed. But I was quite clumsy most of the day, dropping small items &amp; bumping into things.

It took 2 calls to 911 before I could convince him to go the the ER. While there, he suffered 2 grand mal seizures and he was transferred to another hospital for further treatment.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  The patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown) on unknown date. On 29-Jan-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 029K20A) for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.   The patient stated that at some point after receiving the second vaccine, he began experiencing neuropathy that affected his balance and caused tingling.    Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, neuropathy that is affecting his balance and tingling, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Went to ER on 2/16 and was attended a neurologist. He believed that the dx was likely &#34;recrudescence stroke&#34; was the symptoms were very similar to the previously noted stroke from 2016. All testing (CAT scan, EEG, MRI, MRA, echo cardiogram, and blood work was all normal/negative).  I&#39;ve been a licensed physical therapist for over 50 years but had never heard of a recrudescence stroke.  After reading about the signs, and symptoms I believe it was exactly what happened and was correct when he called it a recrudescence stroke

States he had reaction to his first covid vaccine, which was given on 2/23/ 2021. States after the vaccine, he developed &#34;massive, extreme headache -  extreme sleepiness, weakness, no muscle strength, and I lost all control of my urine for about 3 days. I actually had to wear diapers for a few days.&#34; Patient states symptoms lasted approximately 3-4 days, prior to resolving. Feels better now, symptoms have resolved, but he is wondering if he should take the second vaccine, which is scheduled for 3/23/2021.

Left arm (site of both injections) was minorly sore.  Headache, body ache and feverish sensation were severe and comparable to having Type A influenza and seemed to last around 35 hours.  I had to resort to taking the maximum dosage of Tylenol to somewhat suppress the side effects.  I am feeling slightly better from yesterday&#39;s injection and expect to be back to normal tomorrow.

                                                Saturday, Marth 5th -- day after vaccination.  Upon awakening, extreme pain head-to-toe, in muscles and joints.  Severe headache (very rare for me), Hands could barely move (like severe arthritis),  Slightly elevated temperature (98.9 when my normal is 97.8).  Overall symptoms faded slightly and then returned to full strength two or three times during the day.  Unable to eat (not nauseous, just not hungry) and only drank water.  No bowel movement and very little urination during the day.  By about 18:00, headache was gone and pain was receding .  Around 21:00 started getting very cold and could not seem to get warm.  Started shaking severely from cold.  Put on sweat suit, turned on bed heater, and added blankets, then went to bed around 22:00.    Woke up Sunday morning (March 7th feeling absolutely perfect!  None of the previous day&#39;s pain was present, no temperature, no limits to hand/finger movement, and was very hungry.  Ate a normal size breakfast with no problems, urination was normal,   It was like the reaction had never happened, but my wife assured me that it had.   Other than slight constipation, I have no had any problems since.

                                                Guillain Barre syndrome; He reports that he started to experience tingling of his feet and hands about 6-7 days ago. He came to ED at that time and was given pain medication for his back pain and muscle relaxants, which has since resolved but he feels stiffness in his lower back since then. At that time he was also noted to have low potassium and sodium, reports that he was given IVF and potassium repleted. He notes that walks everyday but noticed that for the first time his legs began to give out even when he was walking short distances within his house about 6 days ago. 2 days ago he was unable to walk short distance in his house at all and began to use a rolling chair. At that time he was still able to transfer from chair to the toilet seat. On the day of presentation he started to use a wheelchair around the house (unclear where ti was obtained, no assistance at baseline). He no longer is able to transfer himself from the chair to the bed or toilet seat. Feels that his hands are beginning to feel weak as well. He cannot tell if he is at the peak of his weakness yet. Denies difficulty with swallowing, breathing or speech. No shooting pains down his legs, no change in sensation in saddle area, no loss of control of bowel or urinary movements.

                                                I got out of bed at my normal time of 5 AM and proceeded to the bathroom to urinate, feeling fine. Just before starting to urinate, I started sweating profusely and shaking and so turned around and sat down on the toilet. I then sweat even more as if I was in the shower, and shook violently. I then started feeling very nauseous, but I was shaking so badly that I had to very carefully  hold the toilet  to turn around to kneel down in front of the toilet. I heaved a number of times, but nothing came up. I finally stopped shaking and sat on the floor in front of the toilet for a while, and the sweating got less. After a short time, I got up and walked slowly to a recliner, about 30&#39; away. The nausea had gone away by then and the sweating had subsided. My wife brought me blanket and I rested till 7:30 AM.  I had a cup of coffee about 8 AM, and a bowel of cereal at 9 AM. I have been fine ever since then, no more reactions, thank goodness. That one was horrible.

Clearly a systemic reaction to the vaccine.  The bursitis in my right shoulder precipitated a cascade of adverse effects that became quite debilitating, and from which I am still recovering. The bursitis in my right knew made squatting difficult for about a week, but that symptom is substantially gone.  Here is the sequence in more detail: Vaccinated (Moderna) on Feb 4; went to play tennis on Feb 10; had discomfort raising my right arm (racquet arm)  when hitting my topspin backhand which has a high follow through ; decided to instead practice slice backhand. Developed acute pain next pain. Could not raise my arm ab ove shoulder for weeks now.

                                                About one week after the first inoculation, I had back pain similar to the pain I had 25 years ago.  At the suggestion of my doctor I saw a chiropractor.  I received acupuncture which helped some what.  About one week after the second inoculation the back pain became the same as one month previously including for the first time pain in my neck, right hip and right leg.  I do not have arthritis.  I have an appointment on March 29 to see my doctor who hopefully will provide advice on how to treat this pain.

                                                The patient was found dead in his home on 3/18/2021, 8 days after vaccination. Due to the remoteness of where the individual lives and his lack of housemate, it is unknown how long he had been dead, but it is not believe that he was dead for more than 1-2 days. He had no adverse reactions in the 15-30 minutes that he was observed post-injection. He also reported only a sore arm to the public health nurse in an email a few days after his vaccination.

                                                On February 21 I had my first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. The next morning I experienced a mild 24-hour flu with low fever, fatigue and diminished appetite. My left arm, where I had the injection, was mildly sore. The following day all was fine. At 10:40am March 21 I had the second Moderna vaccination at the same location. By 7pm that day I began to feel flu-like symptoms. By 9pm I had a fever of about 102 degrees, moderate chills and sweats. By midnight I could barely sit up in bed to go to the bathroom, and had to steady myself on the walls as I walked. At one point during the night I began gasping for air and breathing hoarsely. I woke up hourly all night. Throughout Monday the weakness continued. I was slightly nauseous, developed mild diarrhea, and emptied the bowels. Zero appetite; drank lots of cold water. Slept the same as Sunday night with occasional chills and sweats. No more gasping episodes though. Tuesday ? Thursday I improved very gradually. Ate small amounts of plain yogurt, then plain toast. A low-grade fever came and went. I rested in bed all day and slept fitfully. Still very weak. Fast forward to March 31, 10 days after the shot. My appetite is OK now, no fever for several days, energy level about 85% of normal. I am very appreciative of getting the vaccine. The intense reaction to the second injection was startling, as my health has generally been excellent. I have masked and kept socially distant since last March.

Went to bed and around 2:00 AM his brother got a call from his dad (he lives upstairs from him in the same house) who said that something was wrong and he needed to go to the hospital.  The brother found him  sweating profusely, it appeared that the right side of his body was stiffening up, and they started to go out to the car to go to the hospital.  He started to go limp and he collapsed and tried to revive him, they called 9-1-1 and they tried to revive him as well without success and he died.

                                                Initially only ssore arm pain but 3 to 4 days later I was struck with extreme pain in my lungs and upper back. 5 days later I seem to recover from days of pain but no fever. Just really sick for five days where I could only stay bedridden. I have never had any type of sickness like this except for a severe case of pneumonia in 2014 which took nearly one year to recover. This pain and reaction to the shot was similar but fortunately  short lived. I hope this does not happen again when I go back for the booster shot on May 3rd.

                                                Patient received first COVID vaccine on 2/6/2021 and second vaccine on 3/6/2021. Patient presented to Hospital on 4/09/2021 for persistent nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria and jaundice. Patient reported a 1 month history of intermittent nausea and vomiting, generalized abdominal pain, feeling dizzy and weak, poor appetite. Patient had a colonoscopy ~2 weeks prior admission to hospital for cancer screening purposes which was unremarkable and labs done by his primary care at that time were all normal (per admitting physician&#39;s note). At hospital, patient was found to have evidence of hemolytic anemia thought to be autoimmune in nature with a positive direct antiglobulin. Patient was subsequently transferred to hospital on 4/11/2021 for further workup. Patient is still currently admitted to hospital. Oncology was consulted for workup of pancytopenia and suspected warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Throughout admission, the patient&#39;s platelets have ranged between 59-154 k/µL and hemoglobin has ranged 4.5-8.6 g/dL with no documented history of thrombocytopenia or anemia. Patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg x9 doses, prednisone 80 mg daily (1 mg/kg) x5 doses, prednisone 60 mg x1 dose, rituximab 740 mg (375 mg/m2)  x3 doses, and immune globulin 40 g x3 doses. Patient has also received 4 units of packed red blood cells. Given the timing of anemia and thrombocytopenia and unknown etiology, immune response to his COVID vaccine is on the differential.

Had to touch walls, etc      I was generally very weak and had trouble walking and sitting down, and then getting up At about 7-8AM, wrote my new PCP and as I was writing, I started to get intensley hot, sweat like I had malaria (I&#39;ve never had), my heart was REALLY racing, and my skin under my t-shirt became so sensitive I felt like the t was pricking me. Very strange. Started to minimize reactions about 6-8 hours after waking up. I was unable to do my morning PT because of the weakness. I typically go to bed around 23:30, but on the 26th I went to bed at 21:00 and fell right to sleep. Next day (today) was back to 99.9999% normal. Did my morning PT (about 20 minutes plus 10 minutes on the bike). What I have is still soreness in knees. Luckily my pacemaker/defib didn&#39;t get set off by my heart incident. Feel free to call me, if you want.

Within first 10 minutes of injection, patient could taste medication. He described it as the taste of alcohol. Support staff took Patient&#39;s vitals.

                                                I just wanted to report what appears to be a minor delayed reaction to the Moderna vaccine. I received my first dose on Monday 1/18. I had only a sore arm and a minor headache for a day or two afterward. However, this Monday (day 7) I had what felt like a mosquito bite at or near the injection site and it itched quite badly that night. Yesterday (day 8) I didn?t notice much, but last night it started to itch again and I noticed that it had developed into more of a rash around the injection site (nowhere else). It was pink and somewhat warm. I put ice on it and took a Tylenol and it was much improved and it hasn?t bothered me much since then. It is calmer today, but still pink.  I am not really concerned about this, but I thought I should let you know just in case there is something else I should know or do. I plan to go ahead with my second dose which is scheduled for 2/15.

                                                Approximately 20 hours after the injection I began to suffer from flu-like symptoms; headache, fever, chills, aches, and extreme weakness. I was also very tired and spent the afternoon through the night in bed. I had heavy covers but needed a sweatshirt with a hood up to stay warm.  I am not sure when I went to sleep, but when I awoke the next morning most of the symptoms were gone.   Except for being somewhat tired, I felt fine.  I was completely recovered by about noon, so I would estimate that my symptoms were less than 24 hours in duration; no recurrences to date.

                                                Patient received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine on 01/21/21 at a different location and I missed that. The patient did not tell me this was his second dose. Somehow, he had an appointment to receive the vaccine on 02/9/21. I did not know that he had gotten the first dose on 01/21/21. I missed the information on the consent form and administered the vaccine 19 days after the first dose (9 days earlier than the recommended 28 days). Patient did not have any significant adverse reactions other than sore arm, chills, and body aches (which are common with the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine). The patient received the vaccine earlier than recommended by guidelines.  Patient came in today because they received a call that their appointment had been cancelled due to shortage of vaccine. Patient&#39;s wife comes in confused since the patient had already received both doses. I apologized to the patient&#39;s wife, asked if he had any serious reaction and the wife said, &#34;no significant reactions&#34;.  Advised patient that I would report this mistake.

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.

Approx 13 minutes after receiving the dose, patient became weak, dizzy, and extremely diaphoretic.  Rapid response was called.  Patient was wheeled into exam room.  BG checked immediately and was 110.  Initial vitals showed HR 39 with BP 83/48.  Patient was transferred to exam table w/o incident.  He did not complain of CP or SOB.  Denies any throat swelling or itching.  He felt very weak and tired.  He continued to be extremely diaphoretic.  An 18G IV was introduced to the left forearm without incident.  He was connected to 1 L bag of 0.9% Normal Saline which was hung to bolus, running well without pressure.  EKG obtained and showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 43.  Possible ST changes in V1 and V2, but not diagnostic of ST elevations or depressions.  There is IVCD noted.  Patient has hx of AFib - not in Afib currently.  Reports on Eliquis instead of Coumadin.  EMS was contacted.    Physical exam performed revealed a bradycardic HR which was regular. No murmurs.  Lungs are clear.  Patient is extremely diaphoretic and pale.  He is alert and oriented x 3.  He is not in respiratory distress and shows no signs of oral swelling. No hives noted on his skin.  Vitals were rechecked at 3 mins and showed SaO2 at 95% and then 92%.  NC O2 applied at 2 L/min continuous and there was improvement to 95%.  He still denies any respiratory distress and was not manifesting any signs of respiratory distress.  Still denied any chest pain.  NS continued to infuse at bolus dose and BP recheck improved to 108/65 - patient was lying supine.  HR remained between 40-42.  At this time, the patient reported improved symptoms and he was not sweating as profusely as previously.  At this time EMS arrived.  Atropine was not administered in the clinic, but was prepared in expectation as a possible next step.  As patient&#39;s symptoms improved, but his vital signs remained altered, he was agreeable to transport to the hospital by EMS.  He was placed on stretcher and care was relinquished to EMS team.  Patient transported out of clinic in guarded condition.

                                                Arm pain and gout.  On Feb 4 it started as a small red bump on toe with pain. then Toe swelled very quickly, redness spread through toe. Labs and uric Acid levels were normal so suspected cellulitis. received antibiotics.  Toe continued to swell/increased pain. On Feb 5 -  referred to podiatrist who drained the toe and had fluid samples tested.  Gout was diagnosed when it was positive for sodium urate crystals.  This incident resolved without medications over 10-14 days. After the 2nd Covid vaccination there was severe pain in same toe but no swelling. pain lasted only 2-4 days.

Some discomfort but not real pain in upper arm throughout the day, but became really tired later in the day and went to bed early. Got up to use the bathroom at about 11:30pm.  Swung my legs out of bed to the floor and went to stand up but fell forward to the carpet.  I had no strength in my legs or arms.  I laid on the floor about 10 minutes and could not roll over or sit up or get up to my knees.  My wife came around and helped me get up and back on the bed.  She then helped me down the hall to the bathroom, then back to the bedroom.  She helped me back to the bathroom one other time that night.  I stayed in bed for several hours and was very week and mostly sat all day,  I regained my strength over the next three days to where I could stand and walk, although I was very fatigued.  I am now about 9 days later and feel pretty much normal but get fatigued and my balance is not normal.

                                                Injection was given into the deltoid at an almost vertical angle.  After about two hours, and lasting five days, the left arm was extremely sore to the point that assistance was needed to don and remove clothing.  This is considered adverse as compared to the initial injection into the left bicep which resulted in absolutely no side effects.  I believe the location of the second shot drastically effected the outcome.

                                                Possible Stroke; Unable to speak/Lack of pronunciations; Fatigue; A spontaneous report was received from a health care professional concerning 75-years old male patient who experienced stroke (Cerebrovascular accident), unable to speak/ lack of pronunciations (Speech disorder) and fatigue (Fatigue).  The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack. Concomitant medications included included Metoprolol, HCTZ, Irbesartan, and Aspirin.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 012L201A) intramuscularly in the Anatomical location for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 05 Feb 2021, approximately four days prior to the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 030L20A) intramuscularly in the Anatomical location for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Feb 2021, the patient experienced fatigue.  On 09 Feb 2021, the patient experienced the events stroke and unable to speak/ lack of pronunciations. The events resulted in hospitalisation as seriousness criteria. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 09 Feb 2021. The patient was moved to ICU for 24 hours, and was the patient was discharged from Hospital on 11 Feb 2021. Treatment for the event included Eliquis and 80 mg chewable aspirin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events stroke, unable to speak/ lack of pronunciations and fatigue were considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, a temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Of note, the patient has a pre-existing history of heart attack which is a strong confounder for the reported CVA and speech disorder. Fatigue is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

On the 4th hole I started feeling light headed and after an hour or so went home and rested.  My resting heart rate after 20 minutes was 88 according to my watch.  It is normally 60-65.  My watch also indicated that my heart rate was 122 while playing golf.  My temperature was 100.5.  After a couple of hours resting my heart rate went down to 75 and temperature lowered to 99.  I felt fine the following morning but my vaccination site turned bright pink and started itching.  This continued for 2 days.  I have had no issues since Friday, March 5th.

                                                I started having severe balance issues on the 10th and rapidly &#34;progressed&#34; to extreme weakness. I could not walk 50 feet to my parked truck without assistance and even that took me about 30 minutes. After getting home I collapsed on the garage floor and it took me 30 minutes to crawl into the house and finally get seated into a chair with the assistance of my wife. The next morning (3/11) I could walk around the house a bit (without walking stick or walker for help) but I am still a bit weaker (than normal). I have had Parkinsons for about two years but I have never had such an instance of weakness or profound immobility. I have not seen my doctor yet and will wait a while to see if conditions worsen.

                                                The day after (3/11/21) the vaccination at 9:30 PM I experienced shakes, as though very cold.  My pulse oximeter showed low blood oxygen (between 80 and 85%) and elevated heart rate (high 70&#39;s/low 80&#39;s).  [I took multiple readings to make sure the numbers were accurate.]  By 10 PM my temperature started to increase rapidly.  Max was around 101.5 to 102F.  Sweat profusely.  By about midnight the fever &#34;broke&#34; (dropped back to normal range).  This will sound odd, but I felt like I had been shown what a severe Covid-19 infection/disease would look like if I were to become seriously ill with the disease.  Felt light-headed on Friday (3/12/21).  [I had no reaction, other than some muscle soreness, from the first dose.The same day as and after the second injection I had soreness in my entire left bicep all day.  No other reactions that day.]

He was was brought to Health Department off site Covid Vaccine Clinic at local market.   He had a caregiver with him and was currently staying at a rehabilitation facility.  The facility had signed the patient up for his first dose of Moderna unaware that he had received a dose of Pfizer in January.  The patient stated that he had received a dose previously.  The caregiver stated that the patient had not received a first dose, and contacted the facility to confirm this.  The vaccinator verified this with a supervisor, and then proceeded to administer a dose of Moderna vaccine.  The facility realized that the patient had a previous dose of Pfizer on 3/15/2021 and the Health Department.  The patient was reportedly doing well and his primary care provided had been notified on the evening of 3/15/2021.

It was so strong that I initially thought I was having a heart attack. However, other symptoms associated with such an event did not occur, that is no profuse sweating, rapdid heart beat, etc. On Monday, I visted my doctor who listened to my heart and took an EKG. The EKG was normal and she felt that the spasm was associated with the Moderna shot.  I have had no further such events

                                                Approximately 23 hours after administration of Moderna #2 vaccine, subject began loosing muscle strength and control, especially of the legs.  The symptoms became severe enough that he had trouble standing, walking and, ultimately, suffered a fall.  Normally, the subject is able to maintain all functions of independent daily living, exercises regularly and is able to walk more than 5 miles.

                                                Initially after the second vaccine he had typical myalgias/arthralgias, especially shoulder/neck. On 3/19 he got acutely worse with severe pain both shoulders/wrists/hands. He came to ER 3/24 with symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving shoulders/wrists/hands and edema of the hands-pitting edema on dorsum of right hand. He was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t take off his shirt without assistance, couldn&#39;t bend the wrists, couldn&#39;t make a fist.   Clinically, this looked like RSP3PE and resolved within 24 hours on prednisone 20 mg bid which is tapered down today.    Patient returned to the ER today 3/24 with nausea/vomiting and that is currently being worked up. If it appears that this has anything to do with the vaccine, I will file a second report with the new symptoms.

                                                On March 4 patient experienced vomiting. Early morning March 5 he fell and landed on his hip after being disoriented and experienced aches, weakness, and nausea without vomiting throughout the day. On March 6 he experienced excruciating pain in his left hip and went to the local emergency room following guidance from his primary care physician. He was diagnosed with fluid near his hip joint at the hospital and was discharged the same day. The next day, March 7 he was still in pain but able to walk with assistance. On March 8 he got an x-ray from an orthopedic physician and severe arthritis was found. March 10 the severe pain persisted, but he was able to walk with a walker. On March 12 he received a cortisone shot and required emergency medical assistance to get into a personal vehicle with a family member who drove to the appointment. The next few days, the pain persisted, became worse, and spread throughout his body. On March 16 he was transported by emergency medical services to the local emergency room for treatment and was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia. On March 18 he was still being treated when he experienced cardiac arrest while being intubated. He was resuscitated and was on a ventilator being treated for a few more days but ultimately succumbed to sepsis on March 30.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history).   On 15-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced FACIAL PARALYSIS (bell&#39;s palsy (paralyze of the left side of the face)) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, FACIAL PARALYSIS (bell&#39;s palsy (paralyze of the left side of the face)) had not resolved.      No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  The patient was treated with Valtrex (valaciclovir) and prednisone.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to events was not applicable.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event of facial paralysis, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I spoke with wife who stated she was with the patient today, he worked outside shoveling and snow blowing with the winter storm. She saw him minutes before 4pm (she estimated 3:58p) and he was his normal self, then she walked to another room, called out to him, he didn&#39;t respond, so she ran back to where he was and saw him slumped over and weak on the L, she immediately called 911. She has record on her phone of calling a family member (daughter?) about this at 4:01, right after she had called 911, so LKN consider just before 4pm.

On 20-Feb-2020, the patient started AMANTADINE HYDROCHLORIDE (GOCOVRI) (Oral) 137 milligram once a day. On 27-Feb-2020, AMANTADINE HYDROCHLORIDE (GOCOVRI) (Oral) dosage was changed to 274 milligram at bedtime. On 16-Apr-2020, the patient started AMANTADINE (unknown route) 100 mg. On 30-Jun-2020, AMANTADINE HYDROCHLORIDE (GOCOVRI) (Oral) dosage was changed to 68.5 milligram at bedtime. On 20-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 17-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 25-Jan-2021, the patient experienced CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Worsening of ongoing condition), GAIT DISTURBANCE (difficulty walking), LIMB DISCOMFORT (legs felt very heavy), TOE WALKING (high stepping when he walked), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (muscle stiffness and weakness), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (muscle stiffness and weakness), NECK PAIN (neck and back pain) and BACK PAIN (neck and back pain). On 25-Feb-2021, the patient experienced SPINAL CORD DISORDER (SPINAL CORD ISSUE) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), PARKINSON&#39;S DISEASE (PARKINSON&#39;S DISEASE FLARE-UP) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ASTHENIA (WEAKNESS) (seriousness criterion hospitalization).

                                                CHILLS, NIGHT SWEATS. Chills, no fever, began about 12 hours following the injection and continued periodically for 2 days. Night sweats began on 2/17/2021, 7-days following the injection, for 17 consecutive nights and then gradually less frequently until 4/11/2021. Experienced 28-night sweating episodes of varying intensity from full-body drenching/soaking the bedding to light sweating wetting the clothing. Took no additional medication or dietary supplements other than that reported in item 9. Dramatically altered eating habits, i.e., no evening meal, believing that diet could be source of night sweating episodes. The dietary changes had no apparent effect. Did not observe any physical changes such as itching, rashes, swelling, etc. In May 2021, a sleep therapist reviewing my sleep history suggested submitting a VAERS report to report the night sweating as possible COVID-19 vaccine side effects. I am a non-smoker, non-drinker, and rarely get sick. Have a history of infrequent (a few episodes annually) of night sweating but do not recall ever having consecutive night sweating episodes. In April 2019, to determine possible causes of the night sweating, primary care provider referral testing for HIV1, chest x-rays, and TB were negative. Received only COVID-19 test on 6/4/2020 which was reported as negative. Frequent dental visits and screening and never experienced nor reported any possible COVID-19 related symptoms. On 1/13/2021, received the 1st dose, Moderna lot number 011J20A, at a county public health COVID-19 drive-thru clinic, intramuscular right arm with only mild shoulder discomfort. Routinely receive the annual flu immunization which occurred on 9/2/2020, FLUAD INJ 2020-21, intramuscular right army with no side effects. Periodic blood donor with last donation on 10/9/2020. Last medical surgical procedure was dental implant oral surgery on 12/15/2020. As a retired member of service received many immunizations during period of service 1968-1988 and some afterwards for overseas travel as a government civilian.

Awoke the morning after the injection with severe bilateral knee pain to extent that I could barely walk. I started Ibuprofen 800 mg bid with some improvement over the next day or two. I subsequently regained near normal function with resolution of the right knee pain but with residual intermittent left knee pain associated with tenderness to external pressure over the medial knee. I have been using Voltaren hs with good effect. Symptoms seem to be stabilized but persistent.
