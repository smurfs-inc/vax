Meclizine and Ondansetron was used immediately.  Scopolamine was prescribed by the physician on 01/08/2021,  picked and used on 01/09/2021; felt better . Residual dizziness remains after use.     P.S. I do have a medical history of BPPV for the last 2-3 years and have been treated for it. Generally speaking my BPPV symptoms resolve themselves quickly after treatment. This current episode has lasted  forthree days.

                                                Right after the injection, I felt an electric shock feeling in my hand. This was followed by right hand numbness  and tingling in the entire hand. This symptoms of numbness and tingling decreased in severity, but now has been stable: every day, I am experiencing numbness of the right hand, extending from my wrist and involving my palm and my pinky and ring finger.  The feeling is not decreased by Tylenol.

                                                On March 16th at roughly 1:30pm, the patient received his first dose of the COVID19 Moderna vaccine. Afterward, the patient experienced no adverse side effects. About 48 hours later, however, at 2pm on March 18th, the patient&#39;s spouse attempted to wake him from a nap. The patient seemed much groggier than normal and his expression appeared vacant. When pressed by his spouse, the patient could not say who he was, or who his wife was. He agreed to travel with his wife to the hospital. At the hospital, a healthcare professional asked the patient who he was. He answered with his correct name. He also correctly identified his spouse by name. But when asked where he was, the patient gave a long and incoherent response. After this initial screening, doctors at the hospital evaluated the patient for a stroke. They ruled this out as a possibility. Next, they suspected the patient&#39;s MS lesions may have contributed to his &#34;cognitive event.&#34; However, after comparing his 2018 scan to a current scan, they determined this was unlikely the cause. After about 24 hours at the hospital, a neurologist hypothesized that the patient had experienced a seizure. Another doctor at the facility concurred with this assessment. By late Friday (more than 24 hours after the episode), the patient had regained most of their cognitive functioning, though he still experienced mild confusion around the week&#39;s events (even preceding the &#34;cognitive event&#34;). Prior to now, the patient has never had a seizure before.

                                                Within 8 hours of the vaccine I was experiencing a right sided headache, sharp shooting; aches; fatigue and mucousy diarrhea. The right sided headache continued for days. On Saturday evening Jan 16th it became the worst headache of my life. Like a fool I didn&#39;t go to ER until Monday morning when I developed left handed weakness. I was visiting my son and presented to the Medical Center ER where I was diagnosed with an acute sub-dural brain bleed and airlifted to Specialized Hospital. Was admitted to the Neuro-Neurosurgery Unit.

                                                approximately 24  hours after the injection, I had no fever, but chills, sweats and overall since of fatigue.   My resting heart rate was at 100 for a few hours.  Normally, it&#39;s around 76.    I noticed on deep breaths, I felt the need to cough (no phlegm, just a dry cough.  One or two coughs per attempt).  No medical care sought.    Those symptoms dissipated and I felt good.  Then on January 20 and 21, the chills returned.  They lasted about 8-10 hours, then they were gone.  I also developed a headache during the 20 and 21 episodes.  I checked yes in the below adverse recovery box, but I am uncertain as to what tonight and the rest of the days have in store.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

Moved to Tendonitis/Arthritis wrists, hands, fingers and Left patellar knee tendon. SLOWLY improved but did not leave, despite treatment with Aleve, until 2nd vaccine 2/5/2021. Then, same symptoms worsened and included BOT patellar tendons, nd plantar tendons. Continues to present and are very painful at night, despite 2 Aleve BID daily, and  cannot make fist or extend fingers on  both hands and cannot walk on feet without pain at MTP&#39;s. Discussed with orthopedic surgeon who assured me that I was having &#34;an immune reaction in tendons to vaccine. It should get better over time&#34;. It has not at present.

My chest felt heavy and when I inhaled it felt like someone was squeezing both lobes of my lungs. I got out of bed and went to the bathroom to urinate. I went back to bed and tried to get back to sleep. The discomfort in my chest continued and seemed to get worse. I got back out of bed at about 2:45 AM and went downstairs where I walked around my living room to see if that would help me feel better. I continued to feel severe discomfort in my chest and lungs. I did not otherwise feel bad. I was not congested. I could  still take a deep breath but it hurt to do so.  I took my temperature and I did not have a fever. At about 3:00 AM I woke up my wife and she drove me to the emergency room at Medical Center. On the car ride to the hospital I started to feel much better. By the time I checked into the emergency room most of my discomfort had dissipated and only a very slight feeling of heaviness remained in my chest.

                                                started having intermittent headache on 03/08/2021 which he describes as dull pressure starting in his frontal sinuses and working the way posteriorly on both sides.  They are intermittently present and range from 2?5/10 in severity.  No associated photophobia. He has been taking Tylenol at home which provides moderate amount of relief.  He saw a provider on 3/15 and was prescribed high-dose Augmentin at that time which he has been taking without improvement.  He endorses subjective fevers and chills but his body temperature was 99 F.  Mouth ulcers started a few days ago. With that, it became very difficult for him to eat or drink due to excessive pain.   He became concerned because he was also on immunosuppression for transplant and ended up coming to the ER for further evaluation where he was admitted.   Of note, he was switched from Tacrolimus to Sirolimus 3 days prior to his vaccine  3/20 while inpatient, developed fever of 101. Blood cultures negative. Around time of drug changes and vaccine, patient also had a tooth repair.

He also stated that his arm was very painful after the injection.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

                                                Patient was monitored for 1 hour after receiving his vaccine as requested by his primary care provider due to history of reaction to a previous vaccine. Patient monitored by EMS provider x 1hr, no s/s adverse reaction. Patient started walking out of facility on his own and came back reporting he felt dizzy. He was initially hypertensive with a pulse of 70, respiratory rate 12, systolic BP 188.  We had him lay down and about 10 minutes later his blood pressure was 140/70.   After another 10 minutes or so we had him sit and drink water but his dizziness, while improved, did not go away and he started to have chills and was visibly shaking so 911 was called as we did not feel he could drive himself home. Patient was monitored in the emergency department at Hospital x 1hr and released with blood pressure WNL.

                                                On Saturday 01/23/2021 morning when I got out of bed I experienced difficulty maintaining my balance. I had to use a wall to be able to stand. I did not fall. I stumbled into the bathroom, still unsteady. I urinated sitting down, still feeling unsteady, head spinning. I took my blood pressure 130/70, which is normal. Was feeling steadier. Was able to walk down stairs to ground floor of home. Still not felling normal, but steady on my feet. After eating breakfast, no additional symptoms through day. I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages over the past week. When I went to bed Sat night, lying in bed I was light headed. Sunday morning same problems. I performed some vehicle maintenance and would get down on the ground. Head would start spinning, everything would return to normal once standing. At bedtime same feelings when lying down in bed. Monday morning (today) same problems.

Pain is substernal, radiated to the left arm, associated with lightheadedness.  Denies diaphoresis or nausea.  Per EMS there were short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia  3/18: - remains inpatient admission as of 3/18/21 @ 0900 63 y.o. male with a past medical history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He states he was lifting a couch yesterday and his heart started beating fast.  He did not really have any chest pain, but felt a little bit lightheaded.  He called an ambulance and they brought into the ER.  In the emergency room his EKG did show some frequent PVCs.  However, he did not really require any intervention.  He was given 3 nitro, but it really did not make any difference in the way he was feeling.  The patient denies multiple times that he actually had chest pain.  He states he just felt like his heart was beating funny.  The patient&#39;s most recent stress test was a nuclear stress test in May of 2019.  Overnight, the patient has felt very well.  He denies any significant chest pain.  He denies any further heart palpitations.  On the monitor he would occasionally going to bigeminy, which is not abnormal for him.  EKG this morning was unremarkable.   After speaking with the patient&#39;s wife, she told me that he has had a several month history of very limited exertion.  She states every time he exerts he becomes extremely dyspneic and has heart palpitations and sometimes almost passes out.  She states last night he was extremely diaphoretic and very nearly passed out.

                                                Found dead at home slumped on the floor; Loss of appetite; Body aches; Feverish; A spontaneous report was received from a physician, concerning a 65-years-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced feverish, body aches, loss of appetite, and death.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia. Concomitant medications reported included metformin, glimepiride, lisinopril, atorvastatin, aspirin, methimazole, propranolol, and cilostazol.   On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 037k20a) for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On an unknown date in Jan 2021, some time after receiving the vaccine, the patient was feeling feverish with body aches and loss of appetite.  On 09 Jan 2021 at approximately 21:30, the patient was found dead at home slumped on the floor. According to the paramedics, the patient was dead longer than when his wife found him, and no resuscitation was performed.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, feverish, body aches, loss of appetite, was considered resolved. The patient died on 09 Jan 2021. The cause of death was not reported.  The reporter assessed the event, death, as not related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine. The reporter did not provide assessment for the events, feverish and body aches, in relation to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 65 year old male patient with medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia, who experienced the serious unexpected event of death, non-serious unexpected event of loss of appetite, and non-serious expected events of fever and body pain.  The event of death occurred 5 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. The events of fever, body pain and loss of appetite occurred an unspecified period of time after the first dose of mRNA-1273.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   Definitive causal association is confounded by age and medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia.

Discharged per wheel chair to lobby in alert/stable condition, to wait on bus to take him home. At 18:00 his neighbor heard him fall, could not get patient to answer phone, found him unresponsive. Neighbor called 9-1-1, ambulance personnel could not revive patient.  Coroner&#39;s office ruled his death as Natural Causes due to Hypertension, Cardiac disease, Diabetes, ESRD.  There were no indication of anaphylactic reaction noted when I questioned the coroner&#39;s office. The Coroner&#39;s office/EMS were aware the patient had received the Moderna COVID 19 vaccination that day.

Have had a high pitched ringing or hissing in ears since receiving the vaccine; did not make the connection to the vaccine because tinnitus was not disclosed as a side effect, and no questions about this side effect were raised in follow up surveys. Yesterday, while reading an article about someone, committing suicide, I saw a reference to tinnitus.  Only now do I see many reports online of this side effect.

Came back to clinic at 0800 on 01/06/2021 c/o excruciating pain in entire L arm radiating to neck, chest, and around his upper and lower back. States it started the evening of 01/04/2021 and progressively has gotten worse. States it woke him up at 0130 on 01/06/2021 and that he hadn&#39;t been able to get back to sleep because of the pain. Rated pain 9.5/10. No redness or s/s of infection at injection site. Some swelling present at the site. L forearm and hand were slightly erythematous, and he was unable to move arm or fingers much. RN had to assist with putting his jacket back on. States has tried ice packs, tylenol, ibuprofen, tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone with no relief. BP 143/93, P 77, RR 22, O2 sat 96%. Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

                                                Just wanted to touch basis regarding side effects to the Moderna vaccination.  I received the first vaccine yesterday evening, today I have experienced a low grade fever, tiredness, chills, weakness and a headache.  BP was 129/67 this AM. I understand these are some typical symptoms but thought it would be good to communicate.  Unfortunately the test samples were low in this ethnicity, low in senior citizens, and kidney disease is not listed.  Only a very small percentage had two extenuating conditions; while I have diabetes, CKD, hypertension/previous heart related disease.  I understand that the second vaccination could present even more severe side effects.  Any thoughts?

My father received his first dose on 1/21 after 3 days on Sunday evening of 1/24 he started chills and fever till 1/31. He experienced persistent fever as high as 104.7 even 105 at one point followed by fatigue and body-ache. He no longer had any fever on 2/1, just mostly fatigue and not having much energy and also couple episodes of coughs. As of 2/2 he is doing much better looks to be fully recovering. I wanted to know if you would advise if he should get his second shot as well.

With change of position was able to get comfortable after which pain resolved.  This reoccurred the next two nights prompting ED visit. -First ED visit focused on right flank pain and CT Abdomen and pelvis was negative except for &#34;atelectasis&#34; right lung base -Due to more pleuritic symptoms, second ED visit occurred, and CT chest with contrast demonstrated bilateral PEs (approximately 5 on right and 2 on left) with evidence for RV strain -Hospitalized and started on anticoagulation (Lovenox SQ for one dose and then Eloquis). Echocariogram confirmed mild RV dilatation.  Interventional Radiology did not feel removal/lysis of clots necessary. -Completed exhaustive evaluation with Hematology--no underlying clotting disorder identified to date -Have returned to 100% activity without significant symptoms at present

                                                My first vaccination was given at Medical Center, on 1/27/21.  Medication was Pfizer, Lot # EL3302.  At time of scheduling I was told that I could get my second vaccination at facility, which was  about 50 miles closer to my home.  The scheduler verified that facility administered both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.   On 2/16, when I reported to facility for my second shot, I reminded the intake person and the one who escorted me to the vaccination station that I needed the Pfizer vaccine, and was told by both people that  Pfizer was in the record and that I would receive that vaccine.  The person who escorted me to the vaccination station brought the syringe to the vaccinator, who asked me my name and date of birth, administered the shot, and handed me the post-administration paperwork.  While seated in the waiting area I read over my paperwork and reviewed my dosage record card and discovered, that I had been  given the Moderna vaccine., against the CDC guidance and without prior notification to or authorization by me.  I have subsequently experienced shortness of breath, an unusually high level of  nasal congestion, nad a serious lack of energy.  These symptoms began about 72 hours after the second vaccination.

                                                He complained of dizziness the evening of the shot.  He went to bed and when he woke up the next morning he was having double vision.  Is eye drifted off to the side and he was too dizzy to get up.  He was taken to the hospital.  They did a CT scan which didn&#39;t give a diagnosis, and they were unable to do a MRI scan due to a medical reason,  so they could not determine for sure if he had a stroke.  They are assuming that he did have a stroke and he has oculomotor nerve paralysis on the right side.  The nurse practitioner saw him today and she reports he is doing very well now.  He had been staying in a assisted living type facility when this occurred, but he is expected to return home tomorrow.

                                                I suffered a heart attack on March 11, 2021, at approx 145pm, while sitting at my desk - WFH.  My symptoms were sweats, nausea, followed by chest pains beginning on the left side of my chest; sweats and nausea subsided for approx 1 hr, returning again, followed by chest pains radiating  the across the full chest approx.  I left my desk at the onset to wash my face, returning to my desk to talk a scheduled phone call at 2pm, lasting until 3pm.  I left desk to walk outside to take in some fresh air, my wife ask me if I was ok, I said no.  She ask if I was having a heart attack, to which I replied, I don&#39;t know.  shortly there after we left for the ER at arriving approx 4pm.  At that point ER staff did a quick assessment, taking my to an ER patient room where i was advised by the attending Dr that they thought I was having a heart attack.  Shortly thereafter I was taking to the Cath lab where a stent was insert and then taken to ICU.  Where I remained until I was released on 3/12/2021 at 3pm.  There was no detectable heart damage and I was placed a regime of blood thinner, a beta blocker and cholesterol med.  I do not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or history of heart problems.  My last physical was Feb 2021.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

I started having chills. I have a fever, still with aches and pains. The soreness at the injection site is about gone. Yesterday, 01.03.21, I was running a fever between 99-101 all night long. Last night I took one Tylenol to help slow it down a little. It&#39;s been pretty severe up until now. Right now my temp is 98.1.  I did not go to the ER and my wife has the lot number in her purse with her right now.

                                                Approximately 13 hours after the injection, I began to get severe chills and heavy, violent, uncontrollable shaking with some loss of muscle control.  This violent shaking happened throughout the night and well into the next morning, when it began to taper off - no elevated temperature occurred, although there was a slight headache and significant fatigue with some mental fog.  I took a single dose of Tylenol

There is no facial drooping.  Mostly in left side of face and a bit in back teeth on that side also.  A bit annoying and noticeable to me, but not painful or affecting my ability to think or do things.  I have had this feeling a bit in the past, but never sought medical attention for it as it went away.

                                                This is to report my reaction to the Covid19 vaccination. Yesterday, January 26, 2021, I took the Covid19 vaccination at 2:50 pm. Around 10:00 pm I started to feel soreness running up my arm to my shoulder and down to my forearm from the injection site. All night, the pain kept getting worse. By 3:00 am the pain reached a level 8 with any movement jumping to an intolerable level 10, the worst pain I&#39;ve ever experienced from any vaccination I&#39;ve ever have taken. Needless to say, I was in pain all night. I have no other symptoms at this time. Should I be concerned?

                                                Blood Clot in Leg; Tenderness; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 68-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced blood clot in leg and tenderness.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not  provided by the reporter. Concomitant medications reported included diltiazem hydrochloride, atorvastatin calcium and acetyl salicylic acid.  On 13-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:031M2QA) through intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13-Feb-2021, following administration of the vaccine, the patient had tenderness in his leg that continued until he sought out medical treatment. After medical treatment is was concluded that the patient has a blood clot in his leg and has to receive medical treatment to resolve that condition. The treatment information included rivaroxaban.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The events, blood clot in leg and tenderness were considered recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: There is not enough information to assess the causa association between the reported event of blood clot in leg and the administration if the mRNA-1273 vaccine.  Critical details such as the patient&#39;s medical history is lacking. Additional information has been requested.  Howe ever, based on temporal association between product administration and the event of tenderness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

I was supposed to have the second shot last weekend, I did not take. The Moderna employees referred me to to the fact sheet of the vaccine. One of the components is PEG-2000, Polyethylene Glycol. Reading the CAS it says that this product is not to be used by animals or humans. Please clarify

He went home and then went to the ED for syncope on 2/6. Prior to ED, patient states that he became so dizzy that he lost control of his head and it slammed on the table he was sitting at leading him to go to the ED. The ED note is without mention of the vaccine. However, when pt saw me on  2/9, he states that all of his symptoms were r/t the vaccine. He left ama from the ED who wanted to admit him for a cardiac eval. I did not witness administration nor did I know patient prior to visit. I just saw him following his ED visit. It is not my intent to mislead the Department of Human and Health Services, I am simply reporting what the patient told me.

                                                Pt started with weakness approx. 14 hours after the vaccine. Pt said he was so weak he fell out of bed and was on the ground for approx. three hours until he was able to get up. He has had nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. He came into the ER complaining of shortness of breath and chest pressure. Pt has received Normal Saline fluid, chest x ray and is being admitted to the hospital for acute renal failure.

                                                The patient was admitted for recurrent syncope that began on Friday evening 2/19. He fell twice and struck his head, knocking 2 teeth loose. He continued to feel lightheaded the next day and came to the ED and was admitted for syncope workup. His workup was negative. On discharge, patient recalled that he received his 1st Covid vaccine.  His symptoms resolved after admission. This event was likely related to his vaccination.

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.  He was told to go back on Mycophenolate which he started on Friday. Left hand pain from palm to wrist on Saturday.  Some shoulder pain on the left and right side.  Sunday pain got worse.

Temp was 99.8 yesterday.  Temp is 99.5 this morning altho he is taking ibu/tylenol as directed. His wife reports he has traveling pain.  Today is pain is in the Right hand and right shoulder.  No left sided pain today.  Today he is able to hold a spoon in the left hand. He had a &#34;real rough night last night&#34;, didn&#39;t sleep much. She has called Rheum but hasn&#39;t heard from them. Okay to put him in with NP? For ER follow up?  Or should something else be done? 2/19/2021: Call to office PCP/DR. His wife called saying that he went to the emergency room for severe pain in his left hand and swelling he could not hang on to anything.   The pain started on Friday and kept getting worse all weekend . The er told him that it was carpel tunnel and gave him a wrist splint.

                                                After receiving the 1st dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine about 11:30 am on 2/18/21: 1. About 4:00 pm that same afternoon I started to feel some soreness around the injection area and a slight headache. 2. By about 7:00 pm that same evening the soreness and headache had increased and I was feeling general body achiness. It was much worse sitting or standing so I ate a small dinner and then went to bed to lie down. I felt much better to be prone. 3. I normally go to sleep between 11 pm to 1 am but fell asleep around 8:20 pm. When I go to sleep that early I often wake up during the night and will be awake for a few hours before falling asleep again. That is what happened. I slept about 3.5 to 4 hours then was up for about 3 hours then went to sleep again for about 3 to 4 hours. I think I got about 7 hours sleep which was good since my typical is about 6 hours. 4. I woke up the morning of one day after and still felt the same, that is, my arm was very sore, and somewhat swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness, and it was worse sitting and standing and much better lying down prone. Other than getting something to eat I stayed prone most of the day until later afternoon when I did manage to be sitting up for several hours. 5. By the time I went to sleep that night, again a little earlier than normal but maybe around 10 pm, my arm was very sore, and pretty swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness. 6. By the time I awoke on the morning two days after the vaccination, that is 2/20/21, everything was reduced but still there, that is, my arm was still sore and swollen but much less from the peak, and I had a mild headache and the body aches were pretty much gone. 7. By the time I awoke on the morning of 3 days after, that is 2/21/21, I felt normal.

                                                Possible MSG reaction, probably aggravated after vaccination.   Had meal approx. 1 hour before vaccination.   After vaccination (roughly 45 minutes), felt &#34;foggy&#34; feeling, akin to being drunk.   After looking for possible links to vaccine, and given that the reaction seemed like a strong reaction previously attributed to  MSG, searched the ingredients listed by the caterer and found that a side dish listed MSG.   ~~  Drove home without incident.  &#34;Foggy&#34; feeling dissipated after a few hours.   No significant reaction to the vaccine itself except slightly sore arm.

But, by 10:00 PM that evening it was 98.6.  I returned to work on Feb. 11 and 12.  Then on Feb. 13, I developed a severe pain in my chest and back area and it persisted all day and thru the night.  I could only sleep sitting up.  The pain was pretty severe when I laid down flat on my back.  On Feb. 15 at 7:00 AM my wife insisted I go to the ER .  Initially, their computer showed I had a heart attack.  So, I was admitted for Observation on Monday evening and Tue. morning the Dr. admitted me to the hospital and a heart cath. was conducted and ruled out that I had a heart attack, but they are treating me Pirocarditis.  I feel that this is a side effect of the second vaccine since I have NEVER had any heart concerns prior to this.

Around the 4th day he started having a tickling  and numbness around the mouth area.  On 3/1/2021 he felt a difference and could tell something was going.  He went to see his PCP on 3/2/2021.  He was diagnosed w/ Bells Palsy.  He did not give him any meds that day.  When he got home his symptoms got worse.  He contacted his PCP which then prescribed steroids and baclofen.  Pt is applying warm compresses and messages.  He has also had acupuncture.  His left eyebrow is downward and the left side of his mouth is drooping.  He feels like he has sand in left eye.

                                                My father received the first Covid shot 3/2; he woke up 3/3 with severe body aches and weakness, which we thought nothing of.  However, every day, he got weaker and weaker. He has been treated for Liver cancer, he received his first infusion of Opdivo almost 4 weeks before the vaccination.  About 7 days after the shot, he was having trouble swallowing so he went to the ER to get a CT scan. He was found to have greatly elevated troponins, the DR was baffled he wasn?t having any chest pain; they were apparently not trending either., he has never had a heart attack or any other heart problems, takes Nadolol for high blood pressure. The CT scan showed significant growth of his tumors  which had been stable for a year and the last CT scan was the end of January; liver enzymes were also significantly elevated whereas they were stable before.  My father deteriorated rapidly, and died on 3/18/21. The day he got the shot just prior, he was hauling wood, shoveling snow and living a normal life feeling good. The day after the shot he could barely get out of bed he was so weak, until he finally died 16 days later.

I hobbled/hopped to the hall calling out to my wife and  slid along the wall to the floor rubbing my leg and calf. After a few minutes I regained mobility and have not had that same experience. I have hadintervals of sharp aching in the hip joint and calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to experience a numbness/tingling from the injection site to my elbow as well as along my left leg and a general weakness in my left arm. After waiting a few weeks to see if things would change,I reported it anecdotally to our Infection Control Nurse and she advised me to report to VAERS.

Was confused , trying to give me his remote to do what with I wasn&#39;t sure.  He had trouble with getting ideas across.  I wasn&#39;t sure if this was normal for him.  However, we called him this morning at 8:45 am and he was lucid, he stated that when he went home around 4 pm , his left arm , hand and face were numb.  He stated that he could not pick up his cap with his left hand.  Today he woke and feels normal.  He was lucid and able to present ideas in a normal manner.  He vaguely remembers coming back to the clinic yesterday.

It sort of came in mild waves over the course of 2 to 3 hours. Never really disabled me just bothersome and made me want to just sit. Symptoms seemed to disappear after I ate supper.  I felt fine the next morning save fore some soreness just below the injection site.

He couldnt put words together to make a sentence.  He got up to go into the kitchen and then urinated all over himself.  He was worried about falling sleep, scared he would die in his sleep.  The 3rd woke up and was feeling some better but still foggy headed.  Pt went to the ER about 5 days later.  They did a CT and blood work.  He thinks the tests results came back negative. They wanted him to stay longer and maybe see a Neurologist but since there wasnt one available to see at that time the pt decided to go home.  He has blood work and urine labs to be done at the facility on 2/23/2021.  Pt states he is feeling better at this time.

                                                felt so bad; severe chest pain; Chest pain and arm pain; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning her husband, a 71-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced abnormal feeling, severe chest pain,  and arm pain.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included the patient had a heart attack on 26 May 2020 and on October 2020 the patient had five bypass, two arteries they took. Since October the patient&#39;s condition was stated to be great. Concomitant medications reported included Insulin Bovine, Multivitamins [vitamins Nos], acetylsalicylic acid and Medication related to patient&#39;s heart attack.  On 12 Feb 2021, unspecified days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:007M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Feb 2021, post receiving mRNA-1273, the patient had no reaction and did not feel bad.  On unspecified day in Feb 2021 one week prior to the reporting the events, the patient experienced chest pain and arm pain, minimum that lasted for 10 minutes. 3 or 4 night prior reporting the event, the patient was feeling abnormal, went to ER and was hospitalized with severe chest pain. The patient was in a regular room and was transferred to ICU. Next day, Cardiac catheterization was performed to see the patient&#39;s heart and found that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing.  Treatment for the event, severe chest pain included morphine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event of arm pain was considered Recovered/Resolved.  The events, abnormal feeling, severe chest pain were considered as unknown. The patient is still hospitalized.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71-year-old, male patient, who experienced severe chest pain, feeling abnormal. Cardiac catheterization was performed which showed that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time. The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack (May 2020) and bypass (October 2020) confounds the causality. Further information has been requested.

                                                Feb 25th afternoon I started feeling pretty yucky. As the evening progressed I had chills, body aches, and fever. I thought I had covid. On the 26th I was worse. on the 27th I went to the ER, and the diagnosis was &#34;unknown virus&#34; I continued to get worse. On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said &#34;I need to go to the ER, don&#39;t go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you&#34;. I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit. The theory they had at the hospital is that the Moderna vaccine had the full attention of my immune system which allowed other infections to come into my body unchecked. Since the pandemic started I have left my house on my bicycle to the store and that is it. I have had almost no exposure.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine.

                                                When I received the vaccine I did not feel anything, 12hrs after the vaccine my arm suddenly became very sore. I developed severe chills and low grade fever, muscle and joint pain, my hands and feet were cold, headache, and uncontrolled yawning, I suppose my body&#39;s attempt to cool the brain. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and the symptoms mostly abated, but returned about 4hrs later. I am treating myself with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. I have not seen my PCP, I feel the symptoms will resolve with time, if not I will follow-up. I cannot find anything in the literature but do people that have had covid get a stronger reaction from the vaccine?

                                                About 30 minutes after the administration of the vaccine, his case manager came to ask for assistance because the client was feeling unsteady and his speech seemed slower than it normally is.  She was worried about an allergic reaction.  He did seem a little shaky.  They had him sit on a bench outside for fresh air.  He said this was helping.  I took his radial HR.  It was regular, 70 bpm.  I was unable to get his blood pressure due to a broken cuff.  He was feeling much better at that point.  He did eat breakfast.  He said his arm felt fine.  No rash or hives observed and no shortness of breath.   His case worker brought him some water.  We sat there for about 15 minutes.  He felt much better and the case worker said he seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.

Then, 12 days after the vaccination, a red rash started to be seen at the area where the injection was. That area felt warm. The nest two days, including today, the rash started to spread, covering a major part of the upper part of my arm. The arm is warm to the touch. I plan to go to a medical clinic tomorrow, as I am now, visiting my daughter and grandchildren, until January 24.

That&#39;s about it.  This is recorded at around 120 minutes after getting the shot.  I am home and feel fine wasn&#39;t sure to report this or not but since experimental it may be of use.

The nurse entering the patient data told me I could take the vaccine since I had not been hospitalized or given plasma.  My initial Covid 19 symptoms were diarrhea for two days, mild confusion (couldn&#39;t remember an often used password, and weakness.  I had a very mild case.    after the injections I had: Fever of 102.2 for first two days Redness at injection site 2 inches by 3 inches, swollen, pain if pressed; but did not ache, area hot to the touch .  This lasted 7 days.   Felt a low level of disorientation for a second several times.  Bright lights tended to be a factor is causing that to happen..  Made me react to steady myself for just a second.

                                                Started with normal sore arm, ache, tired the day after.  These symptoms went on for a week.  Called Dr and they said they last longer in some people. By the week of the 11th my wife and I were both getting worse.  By Sunday morning, 1/10 we couldn?t get out of bed.  We tested positive for Covid around the 18th  My question is we are supposed to get our second vaccination on 2/3/21, a week from tomorrow.  Given the first vaccine, then testing positive for Covid, should we get the second shot as planned or should we try to delay a week or so to get more strength.  This report is identical for both my wife and myself.  Also, we mask, social distance, no restaurants, etc.  Thank you

                                                Two days after patient received second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, he presented to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain radiating to his back. He denies alcohol use or fatty meals recently, does not smoke, denies nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers or chills. In ED he was mildly tachycardic, otherwise hemodynamically stable.

She reported that patient, was hospitalized a week after getting his first injection and stayed in the hospital for 3 days. She states he presented with confusion, weakness, shakiness and was thought to originally have had a TIA and then was diagnosed with metabolic encephalopathy. She states he is completely different and now has to walk with a walker and confusion persists.

He had a clot in his brain and underwent brain surgery. He experienced seizures after the surgery, but it was ultimately reported the surgery went well. He remained intubated and on a ventilator after surgery. He developed complications of his lungs and kidneys while on the ventilator. Ventilator was removed 3/16/2021 and he passed away that day. The hospital providers thought the clot in the brain may have been from hitting his head over a month ago. From my understanding he was A&amp;O, independent with ADLs, and lived in his private residence prior to these complications.

                                                Patient was found deceased in his own home on Monday, March 15, 2021.  He was found on the floor in a sitting position with three fingers of his right hand on his right carotid.  It appeared that he was getting ready for church, which was a routine event.  Although patient was a diabetic, he never had episodes that were life threatening, and was always able to manage to remediate with insulin or food.  Patient last spoke to a neighbor at 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, March 14th, who said he appeared to be just fine and they scheduled a date with their dogs on Sunday afternoon.  A sheet of instructions found on the kitchen counter at the home informed us that he had a COVID vaccine at the VA Hospital on Wednesday, March 10th.  He was documenting side-effects of very sore  right arm and low blood sugars.  that was unusual because if he was able to manage he wouldn&#39;t have noted it.  It was apparent that something sudden happened such that he was unable to get to help and his heart rate must have been of concern.  We believe that patient suffered  onset of some sort of cardiac event, blood clot, high heart rate, or heart attack, that was associated with the vaccine on Wednesday and 4 days later he was suddenly gone, unable to call for help (he has family close by in this community).  We want healthcare providers and individuals to be able to make informed decisions about giving/taking the vaccine when there is another health issue  such as diabetes to consider.  We lost a brother, a father, a friend and a dedicated veteran unnecessarily.

                                                After receiving the vaccination her husband met with his son.  He reported that his dad did not know anything.  His wife told the son to bring him to Hospital.  They brought him to the hospital and got there and his son said that he had called the daughter and he did not know the day, month, his grandson&#39;s name, like he wasn&#39;t there.  He had a funny look on his face that he was &#34;out of it&#34;.  Asked simple questions about pet at home, favorite and could not remember the name of the cat.  He then came out and said that he was fine. They ran tests for a mini-stroke, CT scan, blood work.  They had a consult with Neurology, virtual.  The neurologist did some questioning, and by 3:00 they felt that it was like a mini-stroke, and she said that she felt it was from the vaccination as it occurred right after the vaccine.  She took him home, and told him to take a nap.  By 4:30 PM she woke him up and said that they were going to eat, she was getting things ready.  He was sitting on the couch about 5:00 PM and had that blank stare again.  He went walking through the house walking aimlessly and started fumbling through papers .  She called 9-1-1 and within 10 minutes they took him to the ER.  It took her an hour to get to the hospital, his daughter met them at the ER.  He told them that he was fine, and they knew that he was not.  By 7:00 PM they were going to do an MRI and wanted to admit him to the hospital.  All of a sudden at 9:00 he was having another episode.  She got the nurse and they watched him and decided that he was having a seizure, (agitation, not making sense.).  The entire episode lasts for about 30 minutes.  They did an MRI and an EEG, which she does not have the results of.   On 2/11/21 she talked to the neurologist who insisted it was due to the vaccine.  He has now settled down and has not had another seizure since 9:00 PM the night before.   He was discharged yesterday at around 1:00 PM, he slept, got up and is fine this morning.  He was diagnosed with seizures, and to FU with Dr. in Epilepsy clinic, and prescribed Keppra, which he has not taken as he feels it was due to the vaccination..   He does not remember the events that took place.

                                                Transverse myelitis with GAD enhancing lesion on MRI C3-C5. Strength was 5/5 symmetrically in the lower extremities, but he had significant weakness in the upper extremities left worse than right. Generally 4-/5 proximally on the right, 4/5 distally; left deltoid, biceps, triceps were 2-3/5, 4-/5 at the wrist and hand. Sensation is largely impaired on the right in a patchy distribution to light touch, temperature, pinprick, vibratory (impaired significantly on the right) and proprioception. Romberg testing was positive.

                                                Seizures; Mini stroke; Tired; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 73-year-old male who received Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced seizures, mini stroke, confused, agitated, eyes were abnormal, memory impairment, and tired.   The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack and stent placement in 2011. His relevant concomitant medications include acetylsalicylic acid, candesartan cilexetil, clopidogrel bisulfate, diltiazem hydrochloride, ezetimibe, adenosine, gabapentin, metoprolol tartrate and rosuvastatin calcium.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on 14 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, 30 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot#010M20A) intramuscularly in left deltoid for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Feb 2021, With in 30 minutes of receiving the vaccination, the patient had a seizure. They took him to the hospital, where he had a computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood work and had a consult. After consult, they said, it&#39;s a mini stroke. They released him and told her if it happens again call 911. He felt so tired and went to sleep at home. Around 17:00 dinner time, he woke up looked very blankly, and his wife reported knowing he had another seizure. She reported he ran to his keys saying, &#34;I have to go&#34;, seemed confused, agitated and didn&#39;t know where he was. She called 911 andhe was transported to the hospital in an ambulance.  Around 19:00 the same day, he was admitted to do scans overnight. Around 21:00, patient&#39;s eyes were abnormal, he became agitated again and nurses confirmed he was having another seizure. 30 minutes later, he was talking to his wife and daughter as if he didn&#39;t remember anything. He mentioned some metallic taste in his mouth.  On 11 Feb 2021, they did an electroencephalogram (EEG) and confirmed that he was having seizure. He was prescribed seizure medication and released him from hospital. However, the patient and his wife reported not wanting him to take the medication as they believe the events were due to the vaccine. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with vaccine is not applicable as the patient received both the doses.  The outcomes of the events, seizures, mini stroke, and tired, were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack and concomitant medication use can be confounding factor. Further information has been requested.

                                                History of Present Illness  The patient presents with weakness.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is generalized.  The degree at present is moderate.  Associated symptoms: abdominal pain.  73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. PT states that he was feeling well until after he went to bed tonight. around 1 am he attempted to get up and go to the bathroom and his wife had to help him. She was able to get him up and he went to the bathroom but he seemed more shakey than usual. He then tried to get back up around 230 am and he was very shakey, said he was cold, and he could tno stand. She attempted to stand him up and she was not able to get him up and move him at all because he was so generally weak. No fevers that he knows of. He did recieve his first dose of the covid vaccine this afternoon. He was well after that and went to dinner and was well until he went to sleep. He has a h/o HTN, HLD, and tremor. Pt did have covid in early december as well. .    Notes: 73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. Pt is alert and awake but slower to respond than his usual per his wife. Labs are overall reassuring. His etemp is elevated but afebrile. CXR with possible atelectasis vs infiltrate but pt has no cough, no fever, and a normal WBC Coutn so I favor atelectasis. His CT head shows possibly artifact vs cortical hypodensities. Will await formal read this morning. Pts UA is clean. He is no longer shaking after a dose of tylenol and ativan. I suspect the pts generalzied weakess is 2/2 his recent covid vaccine yesterday afternoon. Despite this the pt cannot stand and move around on his own and his wife cannot care fo rhim at home given his current situation. Pt discussed with Dr and will be admitted for further care. .

                                                Second day (Tuesday 1/5/21) swelling and some soreness on inside of throat right side. Wednesday 1/6/21 swelling had spread significantly to inside the right side of mouth and tongue also affecting right jaw. By 3 Pm that day my tongue was numb and swollen on the right side as well as the right side of my mouth and jaw. I could only chew, eat, and swallow effectively on the left side of my mouth using the left side of my tongue to negotiate eating.  I could only this with small amounts of food. By that evening about 4 hours later I could eat , chew etc. pretty good but the swelling &amp; discomfort remained but reduced to a functional level.  Today, Thursday 1/7/21, the soreness and discomfort remains inside throat, mouth, tongue and jaw all on the right side.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

At that time he was also noted to have low potassium and sodium, reports that he was given IVF and potassium repleted. He notes that walks everyday but noticed that for the first time his legs began to give out even when he was walking short distances within his house about 6 days ago. 2 days ago he was unable to walk short distance in his house at all and began to use a rolling chair. At that time he was still able to transfer from chair to the toilet seat. On the day of presentation he started to use a wheelchair around the house (unclear where ti was obtained, no assistance at baseline). He no longer is able to transfer himself from the chair to the bed or toilet seat. Feels that his hands are beginning to feel weak as well. He cannot tell if he is at the peak of his weakness yet.

Due to the remoteness of where the individual lives and his lack of housemate, it is unknown how long he had been dead, but it is not believe that he was dead for more than 1-2 days. He had no adverse reactions in the 15-30 minutes that he was observed post-injection. He also reported only a sore arm to the public health nurse in an email a few days after his vaccination.

About 5 minutes into the waiting time, patient said he was getting light headed. It was noticed he was taking deep, sharp breaths causing his mask to go in his mouth. We switched him to a chair with arms and asked him to remove his jacket and called 911 as a precautionary as the breathing pattern was not improving.  EMS arrived to ask the patient how he was feeling and he said he had a dry mouth and was thirsty. At this time, it was aout 15 minutes after the vaccination. Patient refused transport and asked for water. I asked EMS if that was advisable now that he declined transport and it was beyond the 15 minutes. EMS was still near the patient. Patient was provided water and was able to remove his mask to drink and was much more coherent afterwards. He stayed in the pharmacy area about 20 minutes. He was asked to have his wife drive, which he refused.

                                                Patient was into the clinic yesterday for his first COVID vaccine.  Patient had no contraindications for the vaccine.  Vaccine was administered to right deltoid.  Patient then was asked to sit in the waiting room for 15 minutes for observation.  Patient was sitting in waiting room and developed shortness of breath and dizziness.  Patient vitals signed were obtained blood pressure was elevated 150s/100, heart rate 120s, oxygen level upper 90&#39;s on room air.  Patient was brought to an exam room where he could lay down via wheelchair.  Multiple vital signs were taken during the duration of his time at the clinic.  Blood pressure did come down to 140s/90s, sats remained in  upper 90s, heart rate came down to 70-80.  Patient remained dizzy the entire time.  Patient states that he has a history of idiopathic angioedema as well as a heart stent.  Patient goes on the explain that at different times he can have swelling internally.  He has had this happen several times in the past to his abdomen, saliva glands, tongue, as well as extremities.  Patient and his wife called his primary care physician and MD advised if episode did not resolve to go to the ER.  After waiting in the clinic for around 45 minutes the patients wife decided it would be best to go to the ER.  EMS was notified. Ambulance responded.  Patient was transported via ambulance to ER.    Patient wife was called the afternoon of the incident.  She states that patient was admitted to the hospital for observation.  He was treated with Benadryl, Pepcid, Decadron; CT of head was normal; blood pressure was still elevated; and they were not sure what was the cause of the episode.  I called the patient&#39;s wife on 1-29-21 to check on patient again.  His wife stated that he was been discharged home.  They were unsure what caused the episode and to follow up with primary physician in one week.  She states that at one week follow up visit they would discuss the need/desire for second COVID vaccine.  .

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.
