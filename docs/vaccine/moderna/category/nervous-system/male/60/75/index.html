Insomnia that night accompanying whole-body aches/pains/malaise.  Pain most notable in extremities. Nausea more significant at 12 hours (i.e. 6AM) but no vomiting. Significant lethargy all day 1/22/2021. Pain/nausea gone by 6PM but lethargy remained.  Slept most of the day. Symptoms gone by following morning (1/23/2021), so roughly 36 hours.   Overall these were symptoms consistent with a really bad case of the flu, minus the respiratory symptoms.  I often work through illnesses like the flu.  Couldn?t work through this.

I remained in bed until about 4pm 2/5/21 &amp; soaked in a hot bath which relieved the joint pains.  Headache, nausea &amp; weakness continued 2/6/2021 &amp; 2/7/2021 with the headaches coming if any sudden movements such as coughing or standing up too fast &amp; nausea irritated by eating anything but saltine crackers.  Today is 2/7/2021, took sick days from work 2/5, 2/6 &amp; 2/7.

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.  I had been experiencing symptoms every day since receiving the shot.... from headaches, to fatigue, to tightness in my chest, a cough,  pain in my larynx that towards my chest,  pain in my upper left abdomen, strange sensations in my legs, brain fogginess, and some swollen lymph nodes.

                                                Patient had vaccine and waited the 15 minute waiting period.  He felt well after 15 minutes and left the observation waiting area. He went up front to purchase something 5 minutes later and collapsed face first on the floor as observed by a nearby customer. The customer said he started having convulsing seizures and the customer went to aid in keeping the patient safe. the pharmacy manager (myself) was alerted and I immediately ran upfront to the patient with the emergency bag. 911 was already on the cashiers phone. They dispatched an ambulance. The only treatment was keeping the patient on his side and safe. He was having some labored breathing initially which quickly calmed down. The EMT arrived and they called his Dr office off the VAR. They said he had some hx of seizure. He had selected no to question #6 on VAR (Have you had  History of seizure for which you are on medication for). He became conscious before transport to the hospital. The EMT stated that he seemed to be covering  as expected from seizure.   He was then transported to Hospital Center.

Went to ER and was given EKG, Chest X-Ray, and blood tests to check for heart attack. Symptoms subsided after a bit. Labs were inconclusive. Sent home. Continued to have lingering aching in the heart region the next day. Throughout the weekend, continued to experience alternating sweats and chills, nausea and increased pain in hip joints causing difficulty to walk.  Stayed home from work on Monday, March 8, 2021 with the same symptoms continuing.  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 began experiencing excruciating thigh and knee pain to the point of barely being able to stand or walk. Returned to the ER where they administered Torodol and pain subsided. Will be seeing primary care physician Tuesday afternoon.

                                                I read today of &#34;covid arm,&#34; as described in an article about a symptom that may arise for those who got the Moderna vaccine. I simply wish to share my reaction for the sake of the statistics. The evening after I took the first shot of the vaccine I had a hard red bump on my arm near the injection site. My arm ached that night, and was notably better already in the morning, without aches the following day. The blister was gone the next day. I&#39;m relatively healthy, trail run and get strenuous exercise usually  twice a week.

                                                I received my 1st COVID vaccination at about 10:30am on Monday, March 8th, 2021. I engage in rigorous aerobic exercise regularly, including swimming. On the day of my 1st vaccination I did not exercise that day. About 24 hours later, late morning March 9th, I was at the pool for a workout that lasted about 90 minutes. Usually in the pool I may experience a bit of lower leg cramping, if any. But during this swim I experienced a considerable amount of lower leg cramping. After my March 9th swim I was not in the pool again until three days later on March 12th. During that swim I experienced absolutely NO leg cramps. I can?t say if the cramping 24 hours after my 1st vaccination was caused by it, or if it was simply coincidental.

Patient received vaccine at 1407. Around 5 minutes after administration the nurse was notified that patient was &#34;not ok&#34;. RN quickly assessed patient and called for help. At first assessment, patient was having involuntary movements and delayed verbal response to questions.  Shortly after he began labored breathing and became unresponsive. He continued having involuntary movements in bilateral upper extremities. He did not respond to sternal rub. At that time EMS was called. BP was 50/32 in right arm with HR of 52 and O2 saturation of 93% on room air.  EMS arrived to the clinic approximately 5-6 min after patient began having adverse reaction. EMS  took over care at that time. He was then transferred to ED by ambulance for further evaluation.

                                                On March 16th at roughly 1:30pm, the patient received his first dose of the COVID19 Moderna vaccine. Afterward, the patient experienced no adverse side effects. About 48 hours later, however, at 2pm on March 18th, the patient&#39;s spouse attempted to wake him from a nap. The patient seemed much groggier than normal and his expression appeared vacant. When pressed by his spouse, the patient could not say who he was, or who his wife was. He agreed to travel with his wife to the hospital. At the hospital, a healthcare professional asked the patient who he was. He answered with his correct name. He also correctly identified his spouse by name. But when asked where he was, the patient gave a long and incoherent response. After this initial screening, doctors at the hospital evaluated the patient for a stroke. They ruled this out as a possibility. Next, they suspected the patient&#39;s MS lesions may have contributed to his &#34;cognitive event.&#34; However, after comparing his 2018 scan to a current scan, they determined this was unlikely the cause. After about 24 hours at the hospital, a neurologist hypothesized that the patient had experienced a seizure. Another doctor at the facility concurred with this assessment. By late Friday (more than 24 hours after the episode), the patient had regained most of their cognitive functioning, though he still experienced mild confusion around the week&#39;s events (even preceding the &#34;cognitive event&#34;). Prior to now, the patient has never had a seizure before.

I have donated blood in decades and never had an adverse event.

                                                Patient received their vaccine and sat in a chair, within approx. two minutes the patient told another patient they felt hot, I was already walking to the patient to check on them,. The patient&#39;s eyes were glazed, Almost immediately the patients eyes rolled back in his head. I shook his arm and shouted to him , he was unresponsive with agonal breaths.. I shouted for help from the other nurses. RNs came immediately. We moved him to the floor, called for an epinephrine injection to be prepared, I began to prepare the site for epinephrine injection to his thigh, nurse checked for pulse... at this time the patient was still unresponsive with agonal breaths... no pulse was felt so compressions were commenced by RN. Nurse gave approx. 15 compressions to the patients chest ,  the patient spontaneously  began to recover. Carotid and radial pulses were felt at this time. Breathing returned to normal. While this was occurring, we called a code blue and 911 was activated. By the time 911 responded the patient was fully conscious , alert and responsive. He could tell us his name and how he felt prior to this incident. The patient was transferred via a  stretcher by EMS 911 and RN accompanied him to the ER to give a report. The timeframe for being pulseless and having agonal breaths lasted no more than 30-40 seconds. Patient denied any history of a seizure disorder. No  epinephrine or IM Benadryl were administered at the incident site by the responding staff due to the spontaneous recovery.

Admitted 3/17/21 due to hypoxia, had ground glass opacities on CT. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x 2.  Vigorous immune response could have caused lung inflammation and hypoxia, similar to a covid infection, but from the vaccine. 60YM with a history of a chronic inflammatory arthritis on methotrexate, hospitalization in November 2020 with Covid pneumonia, he was discharged on 1 to 2 L of home oxygen, and reports that he was told by his PCP about a month after discharge that he was able to come off the oxygen as his oxygen saturations had normalized.  He returned to his usual state of health and activity with no issues until he received the first dose of his Moderna covid-19 vaccine through his primary care office on 3/13.  The next day he developed arm pain and then progressive body aches, headaches, fevers, chills, and shortness of breath.  He presented to the ER and was found to be febrile with hypoxia and admitted for treatment and evaluation.   Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with ground glass opacities on CT : oxygen 87% on RA in ER, 84% on room air 3/19, resolves with oxygen support of 2lpm.  CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x2 as well as respiratory virus panel, CT shows ground glass opacities, patient was started on ceftriaxone and doxycycline for empiric treatment for possible community-acquired pneumonia, although procalcitonin was negative.  BNP was elevated at 458, so an echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal EF, and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction.  Patient was given 2 doses of furosemide during the hospitalization and BNP normalized. Patient was started on prednisone to calm down a possible inflammatory response triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine in a person who likely already has antibodies, causing hypoxia.  With this patient significantly improved and at discharge is on room air at rest, but still requires 2 L/min with exertion.  CRP was markedly elevated, supporting an inflammatory process.  Autoimmune lung disease panel was sent and is in process at time of discharge.  Patient requested discharge home, Discharged on a slow prednisone taper to avoid rebound with abrupt discontinuation of steroids.  Patient will complete 2 additional days of Augmentin and doxycycline at discharge.

                                                I haven?t had the chills like that in forever! It came in waves. You just lie there, hot, and ache all over, then this wave of chills hits for maybe 5 seconds then dissipates. The 2 mins later, it happens again! And this goes on for  an hour or more! I had to pee but was worried I?d be too cold to stand still. So I waited until I could not wait anymore. OMG! Trying to stand up! It?s as if my joints no longer worked! And when I did stand up I was dizzy as hell! The next day, utter exhaustion. I am so weak, it takes effort to move. Even breathing took work! I didn?t sleep all night as every position I lay in was uncomfortable and had twinges of chills. The amount of energy it takes to physically get up and walk to the bathroom is dumbfounding! This morning I am achy, hot and cold, exhausted, and just had a bout of dry heaves. I?m hoping to be able to get some sleep today.

At first it felt like congestion, but then started radiating into my shoulders, then into my arms and up into my neck. They called an ambulance. They gave me Benadryl and aspirin, which made me feel better.  They missed twice trying to blood, but said I refused, so they couldn&#39;t get blood results.  I don&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction.

                                                approximately 24  hours after the injection, I had no fever, but chills, sweats and overall since of fatigue.   My resting heart rate was at 100 for a few hours.  Normally, it&#39;s around 76.    I noticed on deep breaths, I felt the need to cough (no phlegm, just a dry cough.  One or two coughs per attempt).  No medical care sought.    Those symptoms dissipated and I felt good.  Then on January 20 and 21, the chills returned.  They lasted about 8-10 hours, then they were gone.  I also developed a headache during the 20 and 21 episodes.  I checked yes in the below adverse recovery box, but I am uncertain as to what tonight and the rest of the days have in store.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

Due to past history of allergic reactions, gave him diphenhydramine at 3:42pm. He felt okay for a short period of time and then started to have tightness in his chest.  He could still breathe fine, but called 911 due to past anaphylactic reactions.  While on the phone with 911 he stated feeling more tightness in his  and then decided to give epi-pen shot in left upper left thigh at 4:02pm.  The EMT showed up immediately after and took patients vitals.  EMT advised if wanted follow up monitoring could take him to ER. Patient wanted to go to ER for further monitoring.  We followed up with patient&#39;s wife and she said he was still not feeling very good and had follow up appointments with his cardiologist.  He also came in the store on 2-26-21 and all his test were normal, but still was not feeling like himself.

                                                About a day after the vaccine, (Thursday) I developed a mild headache and mild general aches . These resolved quickly. But  about Friday, my  right hand began to ache a bit. It became excruciating by Sunday.  My right elbow and my right ribs also hurt, but the joints in my right hand were on fire. I could not open, close, or flex it without severe joint pain. It was sore even to the touch especially at the joints.  The hand appeared to be a bit swollen as well. I took ibuprofen and it helped a bit. By Monday morning it was much better, but my hand still aches some.

                                                Ok I got my 2nd shot on Tuesday (03/02/2021) about 2:30 p.m. and was feeling great all evening. I woke up at 2:30 a.m. and thought I&#39;d been hit by a truck, my whole body was aching like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced. I also got chills and was shaking I thought I was on one of those machines that shake paint cans. I also had (and still do) a headache. The body aches subsided about 10:00 p.m. (03/03/2021). It is now about 5:00 p.m. on Thursday 03/04/2021 and I still have a slight headache and I am fatigued but starting to get some energy. On my left arm where I got my shot it is very warm, red, and about the size of a goose egg in the area I got the shot.

Daily diarrhea, watery stool, cramping and bleeding lasting one month.  Currently slowly resolving.  Treated with a variety of remedies over the month, individually and in combination.  ( Pepto bismol, charcoal capsules, imodium, rice, tumeric, and Xifaxin)  Imodium would stop the cramping but not the wateriness of the stool.  Unlike any diarrhea over the course of my life. I will not be taking any booster shots.

                                                After first shot in series, I developed slight headache, minor weakness, minor shoulder pain.    After second shot in series, 8 hours post-injection, I developed headache, moderate to severe joint pain throughout, fever around 100, extreme fatigue and weakness, slight difficulty breathing.  Went to bed for 19 hours and began to feel better with recovery in two days.  14 days post-injection, I developed a systemic rash throughout my body. Consulted with my PC physician. Was prescribed  Medrol Dose Pack.  This had very minor effect on rash.  Returned to physician for consult upon completion of steroid series.  I then received a steroid shot intramuscular in right hip and one week oral steroid protocol.  This achieved a more positive result, almost clearing up the rash.  I had a consult with a dermatologist on 03/02/2021 who confirmed the opinion that the rash was probably a side effect of the Moderna vaccine.  The rash has returned fully as of 3/14/2021.

I had symptoms of a Pulmonary embolism while cross country skiing March 18 and officially diagnosed with PE on March 22, 2021.  I was tested for Covid 19 on March 23, 2021 with negative results.  I had been reporting my side effects (which were none) for the previous 6 weeks following the second vaccination. I did have cramping like feeling in my right calf following a x-country ski weekend about 4 weeks prior  to the actual PE (2/22/21) but it appeared to resolve after about 7-10 days

These symptoms have continued for 3 months after vaccine.  Initially after vaccine became acutely ill with high fevers 102-104 f.  Also became severely weak with severe muscle aches and  severe headaches.  This lasted for 7 days with worst at the beginning.  Then I have had the memory loss and equilibrium and loss of ability to spell simples words that I had no issues with before.  I have had these symptoms for 3 months.  I thought it would all get better but it has not.  I thought I better let you know these problems.  I did not want to but because they have continued I thought I better tell you.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA: I received my second dose of this vaccine about 9:45am on 2/24/2021.  About 7:00pm that same day I began to feel achy.  A few hours later I began running a low-grade fever.  The worst period of side effects was about 11:30pm - 1:30pm during which I had a fever of over 100,, with aches and frequent chills (pretty much every minute during those 2 hours I would shake with chills even though I felt extremely hot).  I was taking ibuprofen at the time (at 7pm and 11pm) yet did not experience any significant relief from the chills &amp; fever until about 1:30am.  I continued to feel achy the rest of the night with an off-and on low-grade fever (99-100), despite regular appropriate use of OTC NSAIDS (ibuprofen &amp; tylenol).   The fever went away by about 8:00am, and the overall achiness largely went away by 10:30am.  At no time did I require any other medical attention.

                                                I had the Covid virus early in November 2020 I had a bad reaction to my 1st Covid shot and wanted to ask if I should get the second one? I was able to get an appointment for a Covid vaccination thru store/pharmacy. I had the shot about 4:00 on Friday. On Saturday about noon I started not to feel right; head ache and stomach. About 4:00 I started to get an increase in my temperature. At 5:30 I started getting uncontrollable shaking. Over a span of about 30 minutes I had 4 or 5 episodes that lasted 30 - 45 seconds. I had a temperature at one point that reached 102.3 I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen every three hours before falling asleep for the night. On Sunday morning I still had a slight temperature (99.9), but it seemed like all my body joints ached. I ended up feeling better about 4:00 on Sunday. Reply

As the symptoms progressed, I felt aching in my lungs on the backside, and flu-like symptoms with no fever, and spasms in my feet and stomach region. Other symptoms have been dizziness, facial puffiness and tingling, with continued aching and tingling in the left arm. The  stiff neck and headaches and general malaise has persisted throughout even until now.   As a school teacher, I have taken the appropriate precautions and received a Covid19 test: Results negative.

                                                On Friday (05.19.2021), fourteen days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (on 03.05.2021) at pharmacy, I began experiencing body aches (mostly leg cramps) followed by nausea, headache, and fatigue. They continued through  the next 36 hours. Today (Sunday, 03.21.2021) the headache subsided, but the nausea and fatigue remain, albeit less so than yesterday. I had similar symptoms in the first 24 hours of receiving the first dose but understand that to be a very common experience.

I don&#39;t recall the numbers however they stated I &#39;bottomed out&#39;.  shortly after gaining consciousness, I became nausea loosing contents of stomach twice.  Remained under observation for 30&#43; minutes, then wife drove me home.  Slept until 5:00 when I was steady enough to walk unaided, and finally eat some dinner.

As time progressed I started to realize I was losing all motion in my arm and weakness on my entire left side of my body, but assumed this was a side-effect of the vaccination .  I was not concerned until my wife alarmed me in the morning when she looked at me and noticed the left side of my face drooped and had that I had difficulty standing, no balance, little use of my left leg and no use of my left arm and hand.  At that point, 7:00am 03/23/21, my wife drove me to the ER.  I was admitted and an inpatient for 15 days including PT/OT/ST therapies at the hospital for Stroke.

                                                Received the vaccine Saturday am 3/20/2021.  Saturday pm had numbness in right foot that lasted a few minutes.  Headache off and on started Sunday 3/21/2021.  No medication taken for headache.  On Tuesday evening 3/23/2021, driving home from work had a sensation of something being wrong.  After arriving home at 7 pm had a short term memory loss.  Could not remember details of the day, for instance, or that he&#39;d already had the Moderna shot three days prior.  Was driven to the emergency room at about 9:30 pm.  Memory gradually improved over the hours following the spell.  They kept him in hospital until 3/25/2021, doing tests to rule out stroke, seizure, brain tumor etc.  All tests came back negative.  Was diagnosed with Transient Global Amnesia.

                                                I had a (first ever) stroke. I was attempting to take Flecainide for atrial fibrillation to reduce palpitations, the week prior and during the day of the stroke. I tried to take Flecainide twice before in the past few months, but I was unable to tolerate it. When I had the stroke, I didn&#39;t realize I was having one since I&#39;m in very good health. I emailed my electro-cardiologist about my symptoms that day and found it difficult to use the appropriate words and reading the email later, I could see a number of mistakes. My ability to comprehend spoken language that day was impaired. I could only keep a few sentences in my head at a time and my attention span was poor as well, like having significant ADHD, which I don&#39;t have. I was unable to retain simple amounts of information the day of the stroke. I didn&#39;t seek treatment on the day of the stroke since I felt it was more of the side effects I had been experiencing from Flecainide. After going to the hospital I felt good and much improved, cognitively. An ER neurologist said that my stroke was a 2 on a scale of 1 to 42. Over the remainder of March and until this day (April 16, 2021), I have made steady and rapid improvement. I attribute my recovery to the lower level of stroke damage and the fact that I worked out every day with physical exercise and I worked out cognitively by doing a series of activities that I chose myself: reading out loud, reciting poetry and tongue twisters, playing logic and puzzle games on the PC, returning to my writing tasks for work, practicing grammar, and speaking at length with family and friends as a way to practice speaking. I had one appointment with an occupational therapist and two appointments with a speech therapist and have completed assessment. I now feel I am nearly completely recovered with an odd sense of some improvement in certain areas such as heightened mood and quicker connections for noticing practical matters.

                                                Extensive DVT requiring surgery. Received second Moderna vaccine approximately one week prior to admission, presented with acute onset of left leg swelling and pain.  Left lower extremity ultrasound demonstrated an extensive deep venous thrombosis extending from the common femoral vein into the peritoneal and posterior tibial vein with a patent IVC.  He was given a treatment dose of enoxaparin and admitted to the hospitalist service.  Overnight he developed diminished sensation in his toes and vascular surgery was consulted.  On 3/31/2021 he underwent mechanical thrombectomy of the left superficial femoral and common femoral veins as well as stenting of the left common iliac vein stent.  Of note he was noted to have May Thurner physiology with compression of the left common iliac vein by the external iliac artery on the right.  Post procedurally the patient&#39;s swelling and edema was significantly improved.  He did not have any significant pain or difficulty ambulating.  On postoperative day #1 he was evaluated and found to be hemodynamically stable with improvement of his symptoms and stable for discharge home.  Prior to discharge it was discussed with the patient that he will need to be on a loading dose of Eliquis for 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg twice daily. No h/o COVID.

I take it daily multiple times. My hands were cold. When I got up and started moving around I didn&#39;t have any more chills. When I got up at 6:30 am. I just didn&#39;t feel well in general. Slight feeling of sniffles, congestion.  I would get some aches that went away in a few seconds. They were at various points in my body, knee joints, muscles, and my head. They were simply a nuisance. I felt tired all day. My blood pressure was up 15-20 points on both numbers during the day. I&#39;ve told my doctor when my blood pressure is higher, I&#39;m having more aches and pains as though I&#39;m fighting a virus. I tolerated the symptoms most of the day, letting my immune system try to work it out. My symptoms seemed worse at 5:45 pm, so I took two ibuprofen. My temperature was 98.9 at that point. The highest it&#39;s been. All my symptoms got better until 1:15 am. I woke up feeling like I was chilling, but not as bad as yesterday, so I took two more ibuprofen. I feel 50% better today and haven&#39;t taken any ibuprofen. Here is the really strange part. I had these exact symptoms and similar temperature ranges twic last year. In July and October I think. I didn&#39;t get tested last year because they were minor symptoms. They were just nuisance symptoms. I took ibuprofen right away last year.  I followed the masking guidelines, social distancing, etc. So, is it just coincidence I had similar symptoms last year two times, that I had when I getting the inactive Moderna vaccine? I had no reaction to the first shot.  I just wanted to provide the information in case it is helpful. Very strange. I expect no other symptoms in a couple of days.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Pain, Rash, Panic attack (2 episodes) and Anxiety. Previously administered products included for an unreported indication: PREDNISONE (for 6 days). Concomitant products included PREDNISONE for Pain and Rash, METHYLPREDNISOLONE (MEDROL DOSEPAK) for an unknown indication.    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia rheumatica) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PAIN (Pain became more consistent), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain/pain is in his arm), ARTHRALGIA (Pain in shoulders), HYPOKINESIA (Could not lift arm), ARTHRALGIA (Left hip hurt), INFLAMMATION (Inflammatory reaction), TREMOR (Shaking), GAIT DISTURBANCE (he could not get out of bed, was shaking, and used a cane to walk), ARTHRALGIA (Joint pain) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in legs got worse). At the time of the report, POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia rheumatica), PAIN (Pain became more consistent), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain/pain is in his arm), ARTHRALGIA (Pain in shoulders), ARTHRALGIA (Left hip hurt), ARTHRALGIA (Joint pain) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in legs got worse) had not resolved and HYPOKINESIA (Could not lift arm), INFLAMMATION (Inflammatory reaction), TREMOR (Shaking) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (he could not get out of bed, was shaking, and used a cane to walk) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Since the patient&#39;s first dose of the Moderna vaccine, he had not been on prednisone the whole time but was recently put on a Medrol pack. He was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica as his pain became more consistent after the first dose of the vaccine. His pain is in his arm and shoulders, his left hip hurt and he was not able to lift his arm all the way up.  The patient believed that the vaccine may had caused an inflammatory reaction that aggravated his pain that was present before the vaccine. The patient also stated there was a time that he was not able to get out of bed, he was shaking, and had to use a cane to walk. He says he never had joint pain, only stiffness when waking up and soreness in his hip and leg that was painful. After the vaccine, his arm hurt to the extent he could not sleep on it and the pain in his legs had worsened. He makes it very clear he had a lot of pain prior to the vaccine, but the pain he was experiencing now is more consistent.

Patient monitored by EMS provider x 1hr, no s/s adverse reaction. Patient started walking out of facility on his own and came back reporting he felt dizzy. He was initially hypertensive with a pulse of 70, respiratory rate 12, systolic BP 188.  We had him lay down and about 10 minutes later his blood pressure was 140/70.   After another 10 minutes or so we had him sit and drink water but his dizziness, while improved, did not go away and he started to have chills and was visibly shaking so 911 was called as we did not feel he could drive himself home. Patient was monitored in the emergency department at Hospital x 1hr and released with blood pressure WNL.

                                                Thursday Nite starting at 11 PM:  A warm feeling at the top of my head like a heat lamp.  Lasted 15 Minutes.  Then Left Leg, Two Toes start pulsating/shaking uncontrollably.  I rubbed with the right foot...it would stop...then start back up.  Lasted 30 Minutes.  Then my chest started feeling like I had a bad sunburn on my skin.  Lasted 30 Minutes...all the while these strange things were going on, I noticed I had asthma.  I ONLY get asthma if I have a cold or flu.  I thought to get up and take an inhaler but decided against it worried about an adverse reaction to the vaccination. I fell back to sleep and awoke with no asthma and all strange symptoms gone. Then Friday afternoon I developed chills and a queasy stomach (belching and gas and loose stools.)  I checked my temperature (on multiple occasions) and it was normal. These two conditions lasted until  Saturday.  Also on Saturday, I developed aches in my neck. Then very late Saturday Night, I awoke to a sweat drenched tee shirt but chills were gone. Sunday...today....I feel perfect.

                                                My oxygen levels dropped below what they had been previously as I am recovering from Covid infection  tested positive 20 October 2020.  If I do anything at all other then set my oxygen levels would drop into the low 80&#39;s.  I have also been monitoring my sugar levels.  I am not diabetic but did so because in ICU was using steroids which elevated sugar levels.  I continued to monitor it at home because I had to do injections for several weeks after leaving the hospital.  Have not had to use insulin til the other day.  Vision is very blurry.  Had that problem in the hospital but it has gone away but since I had the first vaccine everything is now blurry.  Left leg hurts to put weight on the heel. I have nerve damage to the left leg but this is a unique issue.  I&#39;m running a low grade fever 100.2 - in the morning it is normally 96.5-97.6 and this temperature was in the morning the day after the shot.  Neck is very sore.  I have rods from C3-C6 and the pain is in the muscle glands closer to the surface.  It is almost like it is attacking all areas of the body I previously had issues.  I spent October 25 - November 13 in Hospital, majority of time in ICU.

Muscle aches and pains, joint pain, lower back pain right side, headache.  Fever broke after 24 hours.  Some continued weakness for a couple days.  Then back to mostly normal.  10 days later, mild fever returned in the evening of 2/9, and 2/10, temp of 101.  These second rounds of fever went away during the day.  And temp was between 99.8 and 101.2. My question is:  Is it normal to get a mild fever 10 days after 2nd vaccine shot?

I thought it was the normal adverse reaction and I kept watching it until the pain continues with tingly sensation on my left middle finger. I called my family doctor and schedule an appointment to see him. My doctor advised me to take Aleve or Ibuprofen for one week and also go to Community hospital employment office which I did and they noticed I have swelling on my left neck ( lymph nodes )  I have pain on my left shoulder and Tingly on my left middle finger hence am submitting this report.

When I got under covers and warmed up so chills subsided and breathing returned to normal it felt like I was being squashed in a Panini press. Every cell in my body felt like it was vibrating in pain. I had to get up ever hour or so to urinate. I would be back in sever chill mode before i made it to the bathroom and it took about 5 minutes back in bed for chills to stop and breathing back to normal. I was also nauseous the whole time but did not vomit Then. The room temperature was 72F. This continued for 12-14 hrs.  I then tried to drink cranberry juice and eat 3 bites of a banana which  I immediately regurgitated. The rest of the day I was drained of energy. No sleep 48hrs. 3 days

It almost like little shocks going thru my body. I had a video appointment with my Dr. and he prescribes doxycycline and prednisone.  The next day the fever went away and started to feel better (48 hours later).  I also tested positive for Covid on 12/24/20, I didn&#39;t wait 90 days before I got my vaccine.  I felt awful with the second dose, almost worse than being in the midst of Covid. I&#39;m currently on Workman&#39;s Comp. I&#39;m constantly out of breathe and have no energy, I use to have tons of energy. From my atoms apple to my sternum I have tons of pain. My lungs feel like I&#39;m smoking and have tons of pressure.  My Dr. ran test because I have the worst head aches. I&#39;m like slow motion.

After 5PM mainly 101 fever, tired, muscle aches, headcahes, chills, hair follicles hurting ( had this when I had COVID-19 mid-March 2020); My symptoms from the 1st shot brought back memories of how the COVID-19 virus felt, except I did not have the congestion and sinus issues.  Fever broke at 3AM morning of March 13, woke up soaking wet, entire body and hair drenched as if I stepped out of the shower, did not dry off and got into bed. Felt fatigued Day 3 but feeling a lot better, able to be more active. Today is March 19, 8 days since shot #1 and my arm at the Vaccine site is still a bit sore, redness has subsided however.  Worried post shot 2 may be worse.

At the time of vaccination I had very little pain and could easily put full weight on the foot.  About 13 hours after the injection, I awoke to a throbbing foot and severe pain in that foot.  I could no longer apply any weight to it and it exhibited considerable swelling.  I visited the doctor and am now resting, icing, compressing, and elevating the foot.  Diclofenac Sodium was prescribed for pain.  Vaccine induced stimulation of an inflammation response is a possible explanation.

                                                In November of 2020 I was diagnosed with COVID 19 and subsequently recovered.  This was my first Moderna shot.  I took the shot in the right arm and completed my work day with no side effects.  I went to the gym that night - as usual - and wanted to &#34;work that arm&#34; a little.  I had a good workout, no issues.  Went home, ate and went to bed.  About 1 or 2 am I woke up with the hottest raging inferno flu-like fever I can recall having as an adult.  I did not want to alert my wife, so I simply stayed in bed and did not measure my fever level.  My guess is it was &gt;102.  Fever continued until a.m. and deep body pain hit me.  At dawn my fever measured 101.  I took acetaminophen and took a cold shower.  Fever subsided for a short while.  Then it came  back.  I felt weak and flu-pain so I stayed home from work and simply slept it off.  Symptoms slowly subsided by 7pm day 2.  Day 3 I was not 100% but I went to work and was fine.  No other symptoms since.

Currently, 8 days after the injection, my left shoulder joint remains sore and any motion to left my left arm laterally from my side is painful; like my joint is inflamed.  There is no redness or other visible external signs or discoloration.  I can not say for certain it is linked to the Modern vaccine as I&#39;ve had left shoulder issues infrequently in the past.  But timing wise, my current discomfort started shortly after receiving the vaccine.

They called my primary care provider and he said to go to the ER. Did not have problems with  breathing and swalloning. The feeling was like a contracts for a dye to a CT warm and tingles.  Pharmacy called for EMS and was transported. Hospital watched my BP and HR, gave me pepcide, and steroids.  Arrived about 12:15 pm and left 3:30pm. 122/78 HR 73 (approx) now I am home just kinda tired.

                                                When given the first dose I had slight pricking when the needle went in and when they removed the needle. Otherwise no pain.  Later that night my arm started hurting and I felt a sharp pain in my forearm, my fingers felt like millions of needles were picking them in both hands, and I had severe abdominal pain just below the belly button. The abdominal pain was so severe that I was screaming out in pain and my wife had to hold me. I took three ibuprofen, still have the pain, but fell asleep. The abdominal pain went away the next day. The other symptoms took a few days to get rid of.

At 8 pm the day after it is just a dull ache now.

                                                I left the vaccination feeling nothing at all. I awoke the next morning with a moderate pain/discomfort in my left upper arm at the vaccination site. I went to work because I felt okay.  I have five years of recovery.  As a result every 8-12 moths I undergo an episode of about three days where my brain forgets how to sleep properly.  So the morning after my injection, I was on my second day of irregular sleep. Around 10 am, the side effects started kicking in.  I had a slight to moderate pain above my ear on the right side of my head.  I probably had a slight fever as I felt warm and sweaty for about four hours.  I felt slight to moderate chills during the height of my discomfort for about four hours.  I could hardly walk the five blocks to my girlfriend&#39;s home because I was very conscious of my breathing.  (I have been a heavy cigarette smoker for 4o years and an developing a heightened awareness of my breathing and pulse as I feel that I am overdue for a stroke or heart attack after 40 years of heavy smoking.)  Therefore his side effect was largely hypochondriacal.  I took off work yesterday even though the side effects had subsided. Today, I feel great. I feel so great that I laughed at the entry below - &#34;Patient Died&#34;.

On Tuesday, he was airlifted to another hospital and was in the ICU for more than 2 days. Patient spent the next 7 days in the neuro-trauma step-down unit with the results of the debilitating stroke.  He is unable to swallow and his entire left side is affected as well as vision and hearing.

It was at 86 and a minute later it was at 116 and a minute after that it peaked at 119.  It fell to mid 90&#39;s a couple minutes later, then went up to 105 fell back to mid 90s, then rose to 117, fell back to 80, and kept rising and falling until about 3pm.      The technician told me before my shot that it would be a few minutes as they had to do something the vaccine.  I don&#39;t recall what she told me.  I think she said they had to switch a vial or something.  You&#39;d have to ask her what happened before I had my shot.  This morning I have tingling in my thumb, forefinger and middle finger in the arm I got the shot.  I did sleep on the arm that had the shot .

On the third day my right hip area and right leg was very sore and tender to the touch and noticed a rash on my hip area.  The rash spread all over my right leg and foot and the pain got worse.  My toes and foot became numb.  I took Tylenol and Aleve to relieve the pain for a few days however I did not improve for a week.  I visited an emergency care on 03-13-21 and was diagnosed with Shingles and I was prescribed Famiclovir.  I started taking  the meds as of yesterday and I am still experiencing pain all over my leg and numb foot.

I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today. I have no fever. My injection site does not hurt.  My Rosacea became active today.  Today, I wore an N95 mask to ensure that I did get anyone in my family sick. They all wore their N95 masks. At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

                                                On 03/26/21 received my shot and about 20 minutes later i started to have side effects. My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

                                                Received vaccine approx 11:20am, no issues until 10:30pm when I started to feel chilled. I took my temp with a forehead thermometer and it read 98.x. I put the thermometer on my nightstand thinking it prudent to have it handy. In bed under covers I kept feeling cold and started shivering/teeth chattering, within an hour or so my forehead thermometer read 102. My recollection of the time between midnight and 2 to 3am is vague as I was very disoriented, I recall taking my forehead temp several times during those hours - that took a lot of effort, and I saw several readings of 105 and I believe one over 106. I remember thinking I should be in the ER, then thinking how could I get there, then thinking I would call 911 but that I could probably not get my mind/body to be able to physically make a phone call. I believe that during this time span I had brief periods of consciousness when I was somewhat aware that I was having a high fever event, but that there wasn&#39;t much I could do about it (I live alone). By 4am I was more aware, forehead temp reading was 102.something - I got up and made my way to the kitchen, I was unsteady on my feet and remember telling myself to be careful and not to fall. Temp gradually dropped throughout Tuesday, mostly back to normal on Wed.

Arrived at ER around 12:30 pm est on 4/5 (I walked into both places without assistance). They gave me Eloquis at hospital and I had slightly higher blood pressure than normal. Was discharged late in day on 4/6 around 5pm est. They gave me neuro eval every 2-3 hours and pulled blood constantly. They decided to start me on Crestor at hospital as well - was already on finofibrate, stopped fiofibrate aand fish oil and baby aspirin once I returned home

                                                Flushing and pressure feeling in my head/face and ringing in my ears increased immediately after injection. Then proceeded to get a slight noticeable increase in heart rate.   After setting for approximately 15 minutes I was released to leave. I mentioned to them that I just lived down the street and told them if I had any further issues or symptoms I would call them.  Approximately 30 minutes later I was having a slight lightning of the throat or airway and some slight tightness in breathing.  This tightness continued for approximately 2 hrs. I called the clinic and was attempting to get there recommendations but the nurse had left. I was told to get the ambulance personnel. As a prior EMT I felt that an ambulance was not needed at this time. I took 2 ea   Benadryl tablets and those symptoms lessened. Some numbness in lips and face, and felt heart beating in lips. That all subsided as well after taking Benadryl.  Still trying to get with a provider that could give me advise moving forward. The doctor was busy with an Emergency.

                                                Slight numbness lower jaw and left side of face. It feels like a shot of novacaine wearing off from a Dentist visit. I noticed it about 2-1/2 hours after receiving the shot. It has now been almost 24 hours and the reaction is still the same. I have not  seeked any medical treatment .

It&#39;s at a very low level ( I can still function fine) but has not yet disappeared. It&#39;s like my left forearm and hand is slightly asleep and also effects my right arm at a much lesser degree.  I did report this to my doctor do feels its a localized reaction and advised me to continue with the second dose on 2/22/2021.

Pain in the upper left arm close to the humeral grater tubercle almost 8 hours after the vaccine was applied .

Was a mildly fatigued with mild headache as well. Did not check temp but never felt feverish.  On 2/21/2021 I felt symptom free until evening when a slight trace of achiness returned. I slept very well that night and woke symptom free, encountering  no further reactive symptoms.

I remaining in bed off and on for about 36 hours and then worked my way back to eliminate most of the symptoms.  However, after that and continuing at this time, i continue to be achy, particularly in my joints and my hands, fingers and neck, and I find that my lower jaw seems to be moved forward when I awake in the morning.  The achiness is particularly acute when waking in the morning, particularly in my fingers..  The pain is by no means debilitating, but it is noticeable.  I would rate the pain 3 or 4 when waking and 2-3 throughout the rest of the day.     I have not sought any treatment.

Discharged per wheel chair to lobby in alert/stable condition, to wait on bus to take him home. At 18:00 his neighbor heard him fall, could not get patient to answer phone, found him unresponsive. Neighbor called 9-1-1, ambulance personnel could not revive patient.  Coroner&#39;s office ruled his death as Natural Causes due to Hypertension, Cardiac disease, Diabetes, ESRD.  There were no indication of anaphylactic reaction noted when I questioned the coroner&#39;s office. The Coroner&#39;s office/EMS were aware the patient had received the Moderna COVID 19 vaccination that day.

                                                I had sharp pain in my left wrist that went into my hand and up my left arm into the shoulder.  After a few day, I contacted my doctor, but it was subsiding by the time I saw him.  In about a week, it flared up again so I made an appointment with a hand specialist.  He believes I have a carpel tunnel issue.  The pain went away on its own after another week or so.  It returned again after my second dose of the vaccine, as well as other side effects that I will report for the second dose.  I also had some pain at the injection site that lasted for only a few days.

                                                A little over 12 hours after getting my first Moderna shot I experienced severe joint pain in my left knee that caused my entire left leg to become so painful I could not move it at all, as if I pulled an ACL. I decided to ride it out as each day went by the pain subsided more and more to where after 3 to 4 days later the pain was about 90% gone.  I still feel a little bit of soreness on the left side of my left knee cap though.  I am mostly back to where I was before the shot.  During the first few hours of the worst pain I did experience a cold sweat also.  All in  all I am feeling pretty good now however, a bit concerned about my second dose scheduled for March 23rd though, especially considering that I have neve had a negative reaction to a any type of vaccine before and I am not allergic. Great thanks to all!

He then started with some shortness of breath and wheezing the next day.  He then used his inhaler to get through the symptoms quicker and it did help. Patient notes that within 22 hours of having the shot his symptoms then resolved.  He is not having any further issues or symptoms from the COVID vaccine at this time.

                                                On 03/11 I received 1st shot of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA,  after about 8 mins I became very light headed and short of breath after about 10 mins.  I felt a rush come over my body followed by rapid heart beat. These symptoms lasted about 2 mins then subsided. I really didn`t want panic everyone  or go to the hospital all I wanted was fresh air so I left, admittedly not my smartest move but I knew my doctors office was right across the street.  After 24 Hrs. still Light Headed, no breathing issues, heart rate normal  sore arm no rash.

                                                Seen at the walk-In clinic on 3/9/2021 where he presented with complaints of right leg weakness, numbness, and tingling.  He was transferred to ER for further evaluation and management.    The symptoms (numbness in his hip and thigh) began around 1400 while he was working.  He went about his day. The symptoms progressively worsened while he was ambulating around the hardware store. In the ER, his sensation of his right leg was dulled as compared to the left. The numbness extended from his hip to his toes. Felt a pressure-like sensation in his thigh and calf.  Denies pain. Felt as though his right foot is floating 2 inches off the ground when standing with both feet on the ground. Reported his right leg is 1-2 inches shorter after a femur fracture many years ago. Nothing made his symptoms better or worse.  Did have an episode of feeling generally hot and then cold the evening prior to admission. Denied any trauma.     Denied any dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in stools, urinary habit changes, hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, myalgias, arthralgias, recent illness, or fever.   MRI showed T2 changes on the right side of the cord down of the thoracic spine concerning for her transverse myelitis.  Patient did have Covid vaccine 7 days prior to onset of symptoms, one dose mRNA vaccine.    He is on day 3 high-dose methylprednisolone thousand milligrams IV ×3 days.  He has noticed an improvement in the pressure sensation from the knee up the thigh on the right, no longer having tingling in the right lower leg or the left foot.  He is still having numbness over the anterior right thigh.  Yesterday when he went to bear weight on the right heel, he had a sharp pain with increase in weakness.  That has since settled down.  He did have a few involuntary myoclonic movements as described yesterday.  This writer reached out on 3/22/2021 for information on his Vaccine lot number. He stated &#34;At this point I am attending physical therapy, I am walking with the aid of crutches or a walker. There is improvement in the foot and lower leg regarding the numbness, but the upper thigh is still pretty much completely numb yet.&#34;

States it started the evening of 01/04/2021 and progressively has gotten worse. States it woke him up at 0130 on 01/06/2021 and that he hadn&#39;t been able to get back to sleep because of the pain. Rated pain 9.5/10. No redness or s/s of infection at injection site. Some swelling present at the site. L forearm and hand were slightly erythematous, and he was unable to move arm or fingers much. RN had to assist with putting his jacket back on. States has tried ice packs, tylenol, ibuprofen, tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone with no relief. BP 143/93, P 77, RR 22, O2 sat 96%. Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

                                                Just wanted to touch basis regarding side effects to the Moderna vaccination.  I received the first vaccine yesterday evening, today I have experienced a low grade fever, tiredness, chills, weakness and a headache.  BP was 129/67 this AM. I understand these are some typical symptoms but thought it would be good to communicate.  Unfortunately the test samples were low in this ethnicity, low in senior citizens, and kidney disease is not listed.  Only a very small percentage had two extenuating conditions; while I have diabetes, CKD, hypertension/previous heart related disease.  I understand that the second vaccination could present even more severe side effects.  Any thoughts?

He went to the dentist the next morning who diagnosed him with parotiditis. He also saw a NP at his PCP office that afternoon. He was started on Augmentin and took ibuprofen with improvement of symptoms. Symptoms were mostly resolved by 1/31.  It is unclear if this was related to the vaccine, but given the timeline decided to report it.

                                                Paresthesia left arm dermatome of T1.  Altered sensation when touching area only. No pain. Could be actual T1 disc and coincident to vaccine, but this is a first time event. Start date is uncertain as the paresthesia is only noted when rubbing/touching the area.  However, highly unlikely that the start was prior to the vaccine. Note that I intentionally lay in bed reading in a prone position prior to sleep which could compress the C&#39;s and T1. This a long time practice, and again, this is a first time event.

                                                I had COVID19 Vaccines EUA on 1/12/21 &amp; 2/9/21. Most adverse effects I had after the first shot. On the same day around 7:30 p.m. head started to burn and the rest of my body shiver. Whole body skin became super sensitive - it hurt to move sharply. I took Tylenol 1300mg and Advil LiquiGel 400mg. Temperature was up &amp; down (97 to 100.7) for 2 days. Friday 1/15 temperature became normal, but my body started to feel severe muscle twisting aches and that continue for 4 days straight. I&#39;ve continue to take Tylenol and Advil every 4-6 hours. After muscle aches subsided on Tuesday 1/19, all joints started to hurt (two days of nagging &amp; strong pain, most-knees &amp; hands). Suddenly I started to cough for no apparent reason.

He has allergies to bees/egg and a h/o anaphylaxis 2/2 receiving an injection of penicillin in the past. Discussed that prior h/o anaphylaxis to PCN injection was not a contraindication to this vaccination, but is a precaution. Discussed risks of receiving the vaccination vs benefits of the vaccine, which patient states &#34;I already had this discussion with Dr.!&#34; He has multiple comorbidities which place him at a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19. Again received the risk vs benefit discussion. Patient stated understanding and desire to proceed with the vaccination. He will be monitored for at least 30 minutes in area where staff can directly observe him. Patient received the COVID vaccination at 13:00. At 45 minutes later, staff alerted that he was c/o palpitations. Due to confusion and weakness, we were unable to transport him to an examination room. Oxygen, water, and vitals machine were brought to him. He presented with SOB, confusion, lightheadedness. Exam demonstrated acute distress, speaking in staccato sentences. HR in 80s, with lungs CTAB and no stridor - despite increased RR to 20s. Vitals with HR in 70s, SpO2 remained 97% or greater on RA. BP was initially 140/72. A code blue was called and Drs. presented to the area. Patient c/o itchy throat and still p/w confusion/combativeness, loss of orientation, and SOB. No visible swelling noticed. At around 13:58, patient syncopized. HR and SpO2 remained 70-80s and &gt;98% on room air respectively. Pulse remained palpable. At that time, an epipen was administered. Patient woke up. During the entire episode, he was able to recognize a staff member with whom he was previously familiar. EMS arrived, vitals remained stable. EMS transported patient to the ER for further monitoring and f/u. Concern for immediate allergic reaction 2/2 vaccination. After event, patient in need of referral to allergy provider for evaluation prior to consideration of 2nd dosage.

This reoccurred the next two nights prompting ED visit. -First ED visit focused on right flank pain and CT Abdomen and pelvis was negative except for &#34;atelectasis&#34; right lung base -Due to more pleuritic symptoms, second ED visit occurred, and CT chest with contrast demonstrated bilateral PEs (approximately 5 on right and 2 on left) with evidence for RV strain -Hospitalized and started on anticoagulation (Lovenox SQ for one dose and then Eloquis). Echocariogram confirmed mild RV dilatation.

                                                My first vaccination was given at Medical Center, on 1/27/21.  Medication was Pfizer, Lot # EL3302.  At time of scheduling I was told that I could get my second vaccination at facility, which was  about 50 miles closer to my home.  The scheduler verified that facility administered both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.   On 2/16, when I reported to facility for my second shot, I reminded the intake person and the one who escorted me to the vaccination station that I needed the Pfizer vaccine, and was told by both people that  Pfizer was in the record and that I would receive that vaccine.  The person who escorted me to the vaccination station brought the syringe to the vaccinator, who asked me my name and date of birth, administered the shot, and handed me the post-administration paperwork.  While seated in the waiting area I read over my paperwork and reviewed my dosage record card and discovered, that I had been  given the Moderna vaccine., against the CDC guidance and without prior notification to or authorization by me.  I have subsequently experienced shortness of breath, an unusually high level of  nasal congestion, nad a serious lack of energy.  These symptoms began about 72 hours after the second vaccination.

                                                About six hours after receiving the Covid Moderna vaccine I quickly began constant tremors that was strong enough that I could not walk or stand. I did not have a thermometer but I?m certain I had a fever. This lasted throughout the night. The following morning I was bedridden, unable to eat and had flu like symptoms. This is continued for three days now. I am slowly Beginning to gain strength but I?m still bedridden.

Imaging studies showed a lesion in the left frontal lobe and neurosurgery was consulted. Neurosurgery believed lesion was possible an acute/subacute infarct however morphology was unusual. Patient&#39;s symptoms resolved and he was discharged, instructed to follow up with neurology and PCP. Per the EUA, hospitalizations are to be reported irrespective of attribution to vaccine.

                                                Patient became very weak and sleepy about a week after the vaccine.  By the following saturday, he couldn&#39;t even stay awake enough to eat.  His blood pessure was very low and he had a fever , so I called paremedics, and they took him to the hosp.  After many tests, they found blood in the urine, and his blood platelets had dropped to 121.( Now he had blood work done in June of 2020 and his platelets were 225.)  After a few days, his platelets began to creep back up, and are now around 165, back to normal range. He is currently at a rehad facility for physical therapy to regain strength.

On Friday 02/26/2021 I had pain in my right ankle and foot and thought it was possibly just another bruise. Saturday evening 02/26/2021 I realised it was a blood vessel popping out. On Tuesday 03/02/2021 I had an ultrasound and it was diagnosed as a &#34;superficial thrombosis&#34;. It goes from the inside of my right foot to the top of the foot. Then it can be seen on the inside of my ankle, skip a spot, and is again visible on the inside of my calf. It ends mid-calf on my right leg.

Attempted to dial 911, could not pick up phone due to convulsions.  Is more scared of dying of COVID than of dying of vaccine, so will be going in for 2nd dose and wishes to remain anonymous.

Went to bed shortly thereafter. Woke two or three times in the night. Began feeling somewhat warm instead of chilled (except for extremities, which remained cold to the touch). Felt weak and temporarily dizzy each time of getting out of bed. Awoke at one point with a headache, so took one Excedrin migraine tablet. Took a second Excedrin migraine tablet later in the morning of March 18, 2021, since headache persisted. Other than that, took no other prescriptions or supplements until the evening of March 18, 2021. Throughout March 18, 2021, patient felt occasional periods of weakness and took bedrest for it. Probably slept an additional 3 to 4 hours during the day. By evening of March 18, 2021, patient was feeling more normal. On March 19, 2021, patient experienced no adverse effects.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy; A spontaneous report was received from a 66-years-old male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced Bell&#39;s palsy.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch not provided) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Three to four days after receiving the vaccine, the left side of the patient&#39;s face was frozen. The patient was rushed to the emergency room because he thought it was a stroke. The physician confirmed that was not a stroke, and diagnosed Bells&#39; palsy. The patient reported that he spent 6 hours in the hospital and the doctor prescribed him prednisone and valacyclovir. The patient reported feeling better now.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was unknown.  The outcome of event, Bell&#39;s palsy, was considered recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Lower legs felt tired and sore., muscle pain. Progressively got worse over the month of February making it nearly impossible to bend, raise and lower myself. Saw my personal doctor on March 1st. He does not think it is vaccine related. Rans some bloodwork tests. Put me on Prednisone for 3 weeks. That did alleviate the muscle soreness/stiffness  but that seems to be starting to return now that I am no longer taking it. Have a Dr. appointment with a Rhuematologist on Friday 3/26/2021.

                                                My left arm is in excruciating pain I cannot use nor could I sleep first night. Arm is almost dead in some ways. I cannot life past my mouth as cannot even extend very well.  Severe pain, aching also pain down shoulder into right hand. I have tried icing, heat, applied Cold spray. It is slightly painful 2 days later but still lots of pain. I cannot use arm to do chores. Even brushing teeth was hard. Arm was fine till 10 hours later then became worse and worse. Plus have little strength in arm. I cannot use arm to dry myself after shower.  Arm continues to be painful, aspirin does nothing to alleviate pain.  I regret getting vaccine and have doubts to complete series as I heard second shot worse.  I have not sought treatment yet but may go see my PCP this week.

                                                On 3/22/2021, 7 days after I received the second shot, after supper at ~6:00 PM, I felt pain from right feet below the ankle. The pain got worse by 8:00 pm. I though I might somehow got it hurt somewhere.  I massage the pain area and place the foot and lower leg in a bucket   filled with warm water. Those did not help. I went to bed at ~8:30 pm and felt the whole right leg  very uncomfortable. The dull pain came from the foot and extended to the whole leg,  I felt the foot and leg were swelling but they were not. By 12:00 am the pain became less and totally gone by 7:00 am, I urinated four times over night and had severe sweating in the second half of the night.   I  feel alright the next day, just some kind joint/musel  uncomfortable.

                                                Extreme pain and weakness in the right leg [mid thigh to lower calf].  Unable to walk or climb steps.  Unable to stand unsupported.  Right leg buckles and gives out.  Unable to travel, or see my doctor.  The onset of my issues were very sudden and immediate, no lead-up.  In a sitting or lying down position, I am able to freely articulate and rotate my right leg without pain.  In the nine days since the onset, I have treated myself with Aleive and a heating pad for my neck.  The issues have lessened by less than 25%.        Background:  due to spinal cord injury in 1996, I have permanent damage; sensory issues on my right side [mid chest to foot], and motor issues on my left side.

The patient&#39;s medical history included pulmonary fibrosis. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 21 Jan 2021, prior to onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch number: unknown) in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 21 Jan 2021, the patient developed facial drooping (medically significant) and slurred speech. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events.     Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.     The outcome of the events facial drooping and slurred speech was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

                                                Patient received Moderna vaccine dose #1 on 3/3/21 at approximately 0900.  In the afternoon of 3/4/21, patient had sudden onset shortness of breath while at home, as well as fatigue and low energy. Patient knew that a potential side effect of vaccine was fatigue, so he assumed this was just a normal side effect to be expected. States that his difficulty breathing and fatigue continued for about a week. After continued urging from wife to seek medical care, patient visited urgent care center on 3/15/21. The urgent care did a D-Dimer lab, and an x-ray of chest. X-ray &#34;showed something abnormal&#34; so they did a CT scan as well, which showed a &#34;huge pulmonary embolism.&#34; D-Dimer lab was elevated. Patient was transported to hospital by ambulance and had immediate surgery to remove blood clot from lungs at approximately 2100 on 3/15/21. Per patient, the surgeon said the clot was about the size of his palm. Surgeon reported that there was &#34;100% blockage to left lung from the aortic artery and 90% blockage to right lung from aortic artery.&#34;  A DVT in popliteal vein was identified, and the surgeon assumes the clot started in the popliteal vein and broke off and traveled to lungs. Patient was admitted and hospitalized until he was discharged home on 3/18/21. During course of hospitalization, genetic testing was done and it was determined that the &#34;genetic marker for clots was negative, so they think the clot is from a one-time event--patient&#39;s family does not need to be concerned that they have clotting issues.&#34; Patient states that he was started on heparin in the hospital, and was discharged home on Eliquis blood thinner, which is being tapered. Patient states that the doctors think he will be on Eliquis for about 6 months and will not need to be on it for life. Doctors say the DVT in leg will dissolve on its own. During hospitalization, an echogram and cardiac cath was performed, which showed &#34;an old heart attack on the left side, but that collateral vessels have built up already.&#34; Right side of heart was weaker from having to work so hard due to blood clots in lung, but prior to discharge from hospital, the right side of heart was already showing improvement. A heart cath was done to check vessels and it was determined no stents were needed, although there was a small clot in left anterior descending artery. Patient was also newly diagnosed during course of hospitalization with Type II Diabetes in a non-obese person, HTN (which patient had never had before), Coronary Artery Disease, Hyperlipidemia, 1st degree AV block. Was discharged home with metformin, losartan, chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, and Aspirin. The chlorthalidone was discontinued, due to &#34;blood pressure dropping too low--they think his high blood pressure was situational&#34; per wife of patient. Medical doctors advised against receiving the 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. Patient being followed by Internist at hospital.  Patient&#39;s shortness of breath resolved &#34;immediately after clot was removed&#34; but is continuing to be followed while on new medications and blood thinner dosing.  The above information was provided during telephone interview of patient and his wife.

Discomfort lasted 3 -4 days  About 7 days after injection a very itchy rash developed on my left arm, chest, and right arm. The rash are small, prickly red spots that cover most of the area on my arms and upper chest.  It is so itchy that I broke the skin while scratching in my sleep. I googled the condition and find that my symptoms do not match most others as it is not localized at the injection site.

                                                Had a little bit more than normal soreness in the shoulder, felt like bruising.  The day after the injection started getting flu symptoms, fairly severe, fever, coughing, runny nose, no energy at all.  Felt like he had a the worst case of flu he ever had.  He is getting better, but still has some of the symptoms.  The only thing he has taken for it is Nyquil and took a Sinutab.   Did have nausea, diarrhea, everything that comes with the flu.  Sinuses are drying up, energy is coming back and able to eat again.  He did call his doctor and he recommended that he call us and report this event.  He did have to postpone a procedure that he was scheduled for on Monday.

Upon visual, his hand looks swollen.  Patient states that he gets some relief with acetaminophen.  He does not have a primary care provider and does not intend to follow up with any physician.

When I finally opened them everything looked crystallized, I couldn?t see the tv which was on but it was brighter in that area, I couldn?t make out anything. I closed my eyes for a few minutes and opened them with the same results. I closed my eyes about 4 times and then finally I could make out everything .  The only thing different that I took was the vaccine and a packet of Thera Flu.    Nothing else has happened since except a sore arm which lasted 4 days

                                                One week post injection, on February 18, I developed  chills and a fever starting around 9 PM. I experienced diarrhea starting around 10 PM. Fever was approx 100.4 F and was accompanied by a splitting headache and significant body aches, to the point where I was unable to get any sleep that night. I noticed Covid arm the next morning. Fever, headache and body aches continued until Monday morning. I took only Extra Strength Tylenol. Most of the time Tylenol was effective only for the first 2-3 hrs before the discomfort overcame it. I was tested twice for COVID, both Friday AM and Monday AM. Both came back negative. Starting Monday the body aches and fever began to subside but I was left with a feeling of exhaustion and required continuous sleep.  Today is the first day I feel back to normal. I still have a large Covid arm rash, two weeks post injection. It causes no discomfort whatsoever.

Began experiencing steady pain and stiffness in left shoulder injection site within an hour of injection and continued throughout rest of day, night and next day (2/25/21).  Began feeling run down and sore in back, neck and right shoulder at bed time (12:30 AM 2/25/21).  Had difficulty sleeping all night due to musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by pre-existing anxiety (which I took 50 MG of Sertraline for during the night).  Very lethargic when woke up on morning of 2/25/21 and had slight fever.  Laid in bed for 2-3 hours after woke up; did not get up until 12:30 PM due to no energy.  Not nauseated, but have no appetite.

He wasn&#39;t able to speak for 3 days.  On 2/17/2021 he went to the hospital.  They thought he may have Bell&#39;s Palsy so the they did a XRAY and CT.  They were not able to find anything other than facial swelling so he was discharged and told to come back if he did not get better and they would make him an appt w/ an ENT.  He started taking Aleve.  He no longer has constant pain but his mouth still hurts when he opens it.  He will contact his PCP to let her know what happened and to let her know that he will not be taking his 2nd covid vax dose.

Per wife - patient became clammy, very warm, unresponsive, gurgling at the mouth. I ran out to check on patient Pharm.D.  They asked if they could remove his mask , i told them YES! he had a cloth mask over an n95 mask! Upon inspection, patient was not talking to me like he was prior to vaccine. They said patient gets tired and can become out of it, so they were not sure if this was a rxn to vaccine or just one of his episodes.  Patient has prior hx of 3 times stroke and is on dialysis. He did not appear to be in anaphylaxis and was breathing (when looking at chest). We called code white to pharmacy, and  Manager called EMS 5:44pm. Pharm.D came out to assist me 5:45pm. It was difficult to get a pulse using fingers, so we used BP cuff and got 83/57, with 87 BPM 547pm. I had epi pen ready to go in case we needed to use it but wanted to wait since patient was still breathing. While waiting for EMS, patient became responsive and began to talk. EMS showed up and took over. At this time Patient was talking and joking. 550 pm We decided we wanted patient to be checked out prior to sending him on his way. EMS asked us what we had done, and we discussed the above. EMS took over from there 555pm. Everything turned out ok, EMS left without further intervention. Before they left, I went to speak to family, and they were very happy due to the care they received. Event ending @ 6:15pm

Days  later muscle inflammation  throughout my arm  progressively worst  accompanied by occasional tingling  in the fingers,  After the second week  I had a virtual  office visit with  my PPC doctor who said  this was a common side effect and so I just let it take its  course.  After my second shot  (2/15/) the same  feelings have occurred but  even more acute.  Keeping me awake at night etc.

                                                Narrative:  67 year-old male received his 1st COVID vaccine dose at a clinic on 2/25/21 at ~ 11:45am. No known prior COVID infection. No history of vaccine allergies or allergies to any component of the COVID vaccine. Does have history of allergic reactions including hives, angioedema or anaphylaxis to some medications (neomycin, Neosporin, bacitracin) and environmental allergens (yellow jackets, fir trees). Patient reported previously daily use of diphenhydramine (2 caps every morning) and kept an epi-pen on hand. The afternoon of 2/26/21, patient presented to his neighbor&#39;s house requesting assistance with an epi-pen. Neighbor reported significant swelling around tongue and lips, and ability to faintly speak. Neighbor administered epi-pen, but unsure if it worked, so administered a 2nd epi-pen. Within a minute or two after the 2nd dose, patient slumped over and became non-responsive. EMS was called and neighbor began CPR. EMS reported that patient was non-responsive upon arrival. A King airway was placed and a Lucas device used for chest compressions. Three rounds of epinephrine were administered during transport to the local emergency room. Patient remained unresponsive with evidence of PEA during transport. Arrival at the ER occurred ~ 4:25pm. On arrival patient noted to be unresponsive with CPR in progress. Dose of epinephrine administered ~ 3 minutes after arrival in ER. No femoral pulse palpable, cardiac monitor did show some electrical activity. Evaluation of oral cavity showed significant swelling of tongue. Additional dose of epinephrine given. Patient remained with no palpable central pulse and showed continued evidence of PEA. Patient was estimated to have been down &gt; 45 minutes. Patient pronounced deceased at 4:59pm.

                                                Nothing at all for 14 hours...not even a sore arm. Around eleven that evening, severe headache; nausea; muscle aches arms &amp; legs; and most serious two seizures (spasms??) about 5 seconds apart.  I?ve only had a few muscle cramps in my life so the seizures were unusual to say the least. They started in my lower abdomen (seemed like a small band going full circle around my body) and moved incrementally up towards my shoulders.  Rapid movement upward...kinda like squeezing a tube of toothpaste. Each one was only about two seconds long but fairly violent. If I had anything in stomach, it would have been on the floor.  Everything was gone (except the sore shoulder) by five in the morning.

Headache, right side only, started same day at 7:30 PM, sore shoulder at vaccine site about 10:30 PM same day.  Both were gone the next morning.  I recd the second dose of the moderna vaccine 3-13-2021 at 11 AM.  By 2 PM I had a ranging head ache, again right side only.  I drove four hours to the vaccination site, hospital.  I was driving home when this started.  I stopped to purchase Tylenol about 3 pm which it turns out had no effect.  I was driving west into a setting sun, as the headache got worse, my eyes became more and more sensitive to the sun, I stopped a second time to purchase a second pair of sunglasses that I could wear over the first pair, that didn?t help, I ended up stopping at a rest area until the sun set.  I got to my house at about 6 PM, by then I could no longer wear my prescription glasses, besides the headache I was now very dizzy.  At about 9 PM the pain started, between my shoulder blades first, never at the injection site.  From that time on, including today, the pain has constantly moved around my body, the worst pain is associated with areas that arthritis affects me, hips, knees, hands, ankles.  I have had a mild fever, ranging from 100.9 Saturday night to 100.3 now at11 AM 3-15-2021.  Yesterday, 3-14, my head was swearing, my feet were ice cold.  I had an electric blanket from my waist down and an ice pack on head.  If I have ever felt worse in my life I don?t remember when that would have been.  The pain has moderated today, I expect the worst is now over.    If as the health specialists are suggesting a booster will be required this fall I will undoubtedly have incredibly significant reservations with this vaccine.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 vaccine EUA. Rash, burning sensation, and itching begins at bottom of feet and then moves up to the upper torso. Have been taking Benadryl to provide relief from the burning and itching. Began approximately at 9 PM of Friday 3/5. If I do not take the Benadryl the rash, burning, and itching spreads from bottom of feet to the upper torso within 15 to 20 minutes.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

At 11:30AM my whole body broke out in a sweat. By 1:00PM I was feeling better. When I recieved my first dose on 2/20/2021, I had no side effects. lot#024M20A.

Over the next two days what appeared to be muscle pain increased from minor to a more moderate muscle strain (pain maybe 2 to 3) and pain started to move to the shin - Tibia with more pronounced pain in the shin (pain 3 to 4).  Night of the third day woke up with serious pain in the shin - front of Tibia (pain 8 - constant pain, could not be relieved by massage or change of position, breathing became involuntary with heavy exhale, occasional involuntary moan when change of pressure or position).  Pain was relieved somewhat with over the counter pain med.  Pain has been 24/7 since then for almost 3 weeks.

Further into the evening and past midnight I started experiencing shortness of breath and extreme headache pain above the eyes. Extremely Sharp pain in the right arm and shoulder, felt like my arm was being aggressively yanked.  I then became panicky and decided to call a 24 Hour nurse service and describe what I was experiencing.  After spending 20 minute on the phone with the nurse she concluded that an emergency room visit was necessary but that I should contact my doctor at the beginning of the next business day.  The pain still exists.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment information not reported. No concomitant medications reported.  Company Comment - Based on the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. However, the events of confusional state, asthenia, cough, pyrexia, and myalgia maybe related to COVID infection. Further information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, no problems until I woke up in the middle of the night, and I was sore and my arm was hurting and I was sweating. I started having chills. I have a fever, still with aches and pains. The soreness at the injection site is about gone. Yesterday, 01.03.21, I was running a fever between 99-101 all night long. Last night I took one Tylenol to help slow it down a little. It&#39;s been pretty severe up until now. Right now my temp is 98.1.  I did not go to the ER and my wife has the lot number in her purse with her right now.

                                                Staff reported that patient was found Friday morning (Jan 8) sitting at a table with his head tilted forward and unresponsive to verbal or physical stimuli. Staff lowered patient to floor and started CPR. EMS was called and continued CPR at scene, however they were not able to revive patient. Patient was pronounced dead at the scene. Staff written statements following the death of patient show that he had a fall about 1 hr. prior. It is unknown if this fall contributed to patient&#39;s death. An autopsy has been requested.

There is no facial drooping.  Mostly in left side of face and a bit in back teeth on that side also.  A bit annoying and noticeable to me, but not painful or affecting my ability to think or do things.  I have had this feeling a bit in the past, but never sought medical attention for it as it went away.

                                                Felt fine after injection, walked 5 miles home &amp; assured loved ones before going to bed that vaccination went fine with no side effects. After midnight I woke in the dark with many of the same symptoms as when I had COVID in March/April 2020: extreme allover body aches, terrible thirst, extreme weakness.  Next day (Wednesday) symptoms continued; too weak &amp; achy to watch all but the core parts of the inauguration; too uncomfortable to read or to concentrate on music or anything else.  Absolutely no appetite so I didn&#39;t eat.  Wednesday night I tossed &amp; turned all night with a chill that I couldn&#39;t lose even with the heaviest down comforter &amp; supplementary blankets.  That night &amp; the following day I also noticed a distorted sense of time, where hours seem to pass v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y.  On Thursday night two more symptoms appeared: a tremendous cough that I couldn&#39;t stop or assuage with the normal remedies (e.g., lozenges, tea with honey), and that kept me from falling asleep till dawn; and diarrhea (which was limited because I hadn&#39;t eaten since Monday dinner so I didn&#39;t have much food in my system).  The cough felt like it might develop into a sore throat (which had been my first symptom when I had COVID) but it never did.  Yesterday (Friday) I felt as if my symptoms (other than residual weakness) were abating, and Friday night I got a full night of unbroken sleep.  I awoke on Saturday morning with no symptoms, and felt well enough to challenge myself by attempting my usual 90-minute yoga/stretch workout, which proved to be no problem.  Now, at 4 pm on Saturday--about 100 hours after my shot--I feel fairly normal &amp; seem to have no further symptoms.  I do plan to lie low &amp; take things easy, and to have as little outside contact as possible between now and my second shot (scheduled for 2/16) in order to minimize the possibility of re-infection.

                                                This is to report my reaction to the Covid19 vaccination. Yesterday, January 26, 2021, I took the Covid19 vaccination at 2:50 pm. Around 10:00 pm I started to feel soreness running up my arm to my shoulder and down to my forearm from the injection site. All night, the pain kept getting worse. By 3:00 am the pain reached a level 8 with any movement jumping to an intolerable level 10, the worst pain I&#39;ve ever experienced from any vaccination I&#39;ve ever have taken. Needless to say, I was in pain all night. I have no other symptoms at this time. Should I be concerned?

My wife had to help me get out of the recliner and get dressed for our trip. Also I was very confused. I was a bit nauseous and did not want to eat.  My blood sugar was 226.  For the next 6 hours as we traveled, I had to pee every 30-45 minutes. I needed help getting in and out of the rest stops and the vehicle.  As we traveled I mostly slept. I did drink a little diet soda, but did not eat.  After the 6 hours of travel I felt a stronger and was able to get out of the car and into the houses by myself.  For the next 24 hours I felt week, ate very little and sugers ran high.

Head spinning, very weak limbs, barely able to get out of bed and stand after extreme effort, no arm strength, could only move to the bathroom via baby steps with while holding on to whatever was available to steady myself.  I ended up on the floor and was barely able to get up and back into bed after considerable effort.  My arms and legs were like rubber.  I had fever and severe night sweats.  I was virtually unable to function.  This lasted from the night of 02/03 and continued through 02/04.  Finally 02/05 I was able to get out of bed and shakily stand. But I couldn&#39;t stay up long, as I had the aches and pains and a headache still.  Finally 02/06 I was able to get out of bed and stay out.  I hope my description describes the magnitude of my symptoms.  I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to survive.

                                                Neck pain near the top of the neck at the base of the skull slightly to the right of the center began around Feb 1. Began taking Ibuprofin, but it did not go away.  Thought I had muscle strain, but surprisingly there was no stiffness or loss of motion. Tried massage, heat, and cold packs with limited relief. Began interfering with sleep over the next few days. On the evening of Feb 4, I noticed a strange sensation on the right side of my tongue as if I was losing taste or feeling there. At 3 AM got out o bed due to neck pain and noticed right eye felt strange and was drooping. When I got up at 8 AM I saw eye droop and smile was only on one side of mouth. Called my doctor and was directed to an advice nurse who told me to go to the ER right away, since this could be a stroke or Bell&#39;s Palsy. Went to ER and was diagnosed as Bell&#39;s Palsy after blood tests, EKG, CT scan, and tests of limbs. Given medications and and released with prescriptions sent to CVS for prednisone and valacyclovir.

My gums are all read all over my mouth with no pain, no swelling of the gums, no bleeding or anything else. A deep color with the gums actually &#34;shrinking&#34;. I am contacting my dentist to seek treatment next.

                                                On Wed. Feb 3 about 13.5 hrs after second dose Moderna (3 AM), I showed no symptoms from getting shot at 1:30 pm Feb 2 until going to bed, but at 3 AM woke due to significant headache and arm soreness.  Laid there about an hour until I got our of bed at 4 AM, got Tylenol from hall closet and went in bathroom to take Tylenol.  I was fine until I tried to open Tylenol, and suddenly started sweating, dizzy, feeling faint.  Managed to get to floor with my wife&#39;s assistance, lay for awhile but couldn&#39;t get up to walk so crawled back to bed.  Had severe chills for over an hour until fell asleep.  Spend next 36 hours in bed due to headache and dizziness, very fatigued napping off and on, but chills never returned.  By evening of Feb 4 I felt stable enough to walk around the house and eat dinner meal at dining table.  Saturday, Feb 5 stayed home fatigued napping off and on.  By Sunday morning Feb 6 I felt good enough to play a round of golf without incident and felt 100% recovered by Sunday afternoon

                                                I started feeling fatigued on Sunday Feb 14. I started feeling this way in the afternoon. Next I felt like I had indigestion so I took some tums. At about 1:00am on Monday morning I woke up and felt really bad and thought I had indigestion so I tried to take some more tums and vomited. I was really weak and short of breath. I laid back down and tried to go to sleep but my heart felt like it was racing. Within an hour I was back up vomiting again with shortness of breath, weakness, heart racing. I tried to lay back down but within another hour I vomited again. This went on until 8:30am Monday morning. My pulse was everywhere. 97 to 112bpm. I was having chills all day and weak. I slept a lot Monday and also had diarrhea on Monday morning. I couldn&#39;t eat all of Monday and finally ate some soup on Tuesday. I am feeling much better today but still a little fatigued.

On 2-15-2021 I developed a rash very similar to Hives over approximately 10% of my upper torso between my waist and neck.  Was very itchy so I applied an itch stopping cream which eliminated most of the itching.  By the next morning some much reduced rash remained but virtually no itching.  As I write this at 9 PM 2-16-2021 the rash is still evident.

                                                Patient Statement:  No symptoms until the following morning at about 7:30am when I noticed mild discomfort and subsequently measured my heart rate via iWatch.  The results indicated tachycarida, with rates raning from about 54 to 173 BPM,  The rate would rise slowly to different peaks, remaining at that level for 1 to 3 mins, then return slowly to normal, the periods of change being in the 1 to 3 minute range.  When running a ECG via my iWatch the Sinus Rhythm appeared abnormal only in period, showing changing rates mirroring what my BPM showed.  The distress was more psychological than physiological, feeling about the same as when our grade school PE teacher would make us run every day.  I hated running, as the breathing burned my lungs and gave me discomfort, but I&#39;m sure it was the same for all of us.  I have no allergies, have never had Influenza, was never absent a single day from school for sickness from Kindergarten all the way through 4 years of college.  I had a cardio work-up a few years ago that showed nothing abnormal, and a health screening about 2 years ago for deep vein and extremity circulation without nominal results.  I&#39;ve been nearly vegan for several years, and have lost around 30 lbs within the last year, approaching a BMI withing normal range.  I do have a slightly elevated BP, but that is reducing with weight loss.  I have had kidney stones since about 1996, but they tend to pass withing a few hours.  Nothing else to report.

                                                Approximately 11 hours post-injection, general tiredness crept over me.  Decided to call it a night early and before I could get in bed, the chills and shaking began.  This continued for approximately 4 hours.  I was thirsty and struggled to get up and get water, as I was getting weak and unsure of my stance.  No fever, but headache and general joint aching began around midnight.  Sleep was practically nonexistent.  Got out of bed around 7 a.m. to eat and take acetaminophen for headache.  Also prepared and started pushing electrolyte sports fluids (drink tabs).  Ate a piece of toast with jelly and could not taste it.  Had lost my sense of taste.  Went back to bed for my first of 2 morning naps.  After my second nap, approximately 11:00 a.m., most of the symptoms had abated although I was still weak.  Had oatmeal with protein powder (standard breakfast for me) and more electrolytes.  Recovery was rapid and by 3:00 p.m., all symptoms except loss of taste had resolved.  Taste finally return the next day.

I have not seen a physician yet, but doctor ordered an x-ray which he said showed no fracture. I am waiting to see a podiatrist . My foot has shown no signs of improvement so far.

Pain will wake me up at night.  Trying to take it easy, stretch it out.  Some relief after stretching  for awhile and increase range of motion for awhile.  no treatment yet.

                                                Blood Clot in Leg; Tenderness; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 68-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced blood clot in leg and tenderness.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not  provided by the reporter. Concomitant medications reported included diltiazem hydrochloride, atorvastatin calcium and acetyl salicylic acid.  On 13-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:031M2QA) through intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13-Feb-2021, following administration of the vaccine, the patient had tenderness in his leg that continued until he sought out medical treatment. After medical treatment is was concluded that the patient has a blood clot in his leg and has to receive medical treatment to resolve that condition. The treatment information included rivaroxaban.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The events, blood clot in leg and tenderness were considered recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: There is not enough information to assess the causa association between the reported event of blood clot in leg and the administration if the mRNA-1273 vaccine.  Critical details such as the patient&#39;s medical history is lacking. Additional information has been requested.  Howe ever, based on temporal association between product administration and the event of tenderness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Mild pain at injection site increased to moderate/moderately severe requiring two doses of acetaminophen 825 mg p.o.  Pain reached a maximum at around 9 pm on 1/4/21.  Malaise, body aches, skin sensitivity also increased during the day on 1/4, relieved somewhat by the Tylenol.  I was never able to document fever though I felt &#34;feverish&#34;.   Awoke on 1/5/21 feeling better and all symptoms are steadily improving though not completely resolved at time of this report, 1045 hours on 1/5/21.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

I must have slept at least 3 times my usual 6hrs/night both days. Also Friday and increasingly Saturday,  the injection site got much more swollen, hot and stiff than any other vaccination I have ever had. I wish I had been warned of this probability, I need to sleep on that arm due to reflux issues. Sunday morning I awoke with all health and energy back to normal. I will be sure to get my (reluctant) 2nd shot in the other arm.

Felt flush and fatigued through the early morning, took his temp this a.m. at 0930 and reported temp ranging to 100.4 F  Pt states that his usual baseline body temp is 97.  Pt states aside from a bit of fatigue he is otherwise without symptoms.  He works part time as a mental health counselor.  Pt was screened for COVID 19 and as well for influenza, those test results are pending at the time of this submission.  I did discuss with the patient that a bit of fever following receiving vaccines is not an uncommon side effect.  I did also encourage the patient to participate in the V-Safe registry program.

                                                69 YO M CARDIAC ARREST. PT HAD JUST RECEIVED HIS COVID VACCINATION AND WAS PULLING INTO THE OBSERVATION AREA WHEN HE LOST CONTROL OF HIS TRUCK, BECAME UNCONSCIOUS AND CRASHED INTO A LIGHT POLE. THIS OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THE STANDBY MEDIC UNIT AND OTHER FIRE DEPT STAFF. PT WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE IN CARDIAC ARREST. CPR WAS INITIATED WITHIN SECONDS OF BEING REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE. EMS WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DEFIBRILLATED FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SINE WAVE VT/COURSE VF WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF HIS ARREST. PT WAS PLACED ONTO A BACK BOARD AND MOVED TO AMBULANCE IN A PULSED VT AND WAS AWAKE AND RESPONSIVE. ONCE IN THE BACK THE PT WAS WIRED INTO THE FOUR LEAD AND WAS SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERTED AT 100 J WITH A CONVERSION TO A PULSED JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM WITH A RATE OF ABOUT 58. THIS RHYTHM CHANGED INTO A SINUS TACH AT ABOUT 100 BPM. IV ACCESS WAS OBTAINED AND 100 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS ADMINISTERED WITH A 2:1 LIDO DRIP HUNG. AMBULANCE BEGAN TRANSPORT TO ER. OVER NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES PT BEGAN HAVING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY IN THE FORM OF PVCs COUPLETS AND EVENTUALLY 4-5 BEAT RUNS OF VTACH WHILE ON PHONE WITH ER MD. DISCUSSED GIVING ANOTHER BOLUS OF LIDO AND INCREASING DRIP TO 3:1 DUE TO INCREASING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY. THE ER PHYSICIAN CONCURRED AND ANOTHER 75 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS GIVEN FOLLOWED BY INCREASING THE DRIP RATE TO 3MG/MINUTE FOLLOWING THE SECOND LIDO DOSE AND DRIP ADJUSTMENT THE PATIENT&#39;S VENTRICULAR ECTOPY RESOLVED AND THE PATIENT REMAINED IN A SINUS RHYTHM / SLOW SINUS TACH THROUGHOUT TRANSPORT AND TRANSFER OF CARE TO THE ER. A 12 LEAD WAS OBTAINED JUST PRIOR TO ARRIVAL IN ED THAT SHOWED SINUS TACH WITHOUT VENTRICULAR ECTOPY BUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE PACs, FLIPPED T WAVES IN aVL, AND ST DEPRESSION IN V4, V5, V6. PT WAS MOVED FROM AMBULANCE TO ER AND CARE TRANSFERRED TO ER MD AND STAFF. HEENT - WHEN PT WAS FIRST PULLED FROM VEHICLE HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS, NOT BREATHING, AND PULSELESS, PT WAS BRIGHT RED BUT DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE HIVES ON FACE/NECK OR ANGIOEDEMA. CX - PT WAS BRIGHT RED FROM THE NIPPLE LINE UP, NO OBVIOUS HIVES, EKG QUICK COMBO PADS ATTACHED AND PT&#39;S INITIAL RHYTHM WAS WHAT APPEARED TO BE A TORSADES LOOKING VT OR VF WITH THE CHARACTERISTIC SINE WAVE PATTERN. EXTREM - PT WAS PWD, WITH PULSED VT HAD RADIAL PULSES, NO PURPOSEFUL MOVEMENT AT THAT TIME. DUE TO THE PATIENT RECEIVING THE COVID VACCINE MINUTES BEFORE THE PT&#39;S ARREST AND THE BRIGHT RED/FLUSHED APPEARANCE FROM THE NIPPLE LINE UP AN ALLERGIC REATION/ANAPHYLAXIS (ALTHOUGH UNLIKELY) WAS CONSIDERED BUT AS THE PATIENT DID NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS IT WAS DECIDED OBSERVE PT FOR ADDITIONAL OR WORSENING SIGNS AND WITHOLD ANY TREATMENT FOR SAME UNTIL/UNLESS ADDITIONAL S/S PRESENTED. THIS WAS LATER DISCUSSED WITH ER MD AND HE CONCURRED. R/O SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST WITH ROSC EXAM, CPR, DEFIB, MOVED TO MEDIC UNIT, OXYGEN 15 LPM NRB, SYNCH CARDIOVERSION, VS, IV X3, LIDO BOLUS AND 2:1 DRIP, TX SPH ER, BASE CONTACT WITH ER PHYSICIAN, 2ND LIDO BOLUS AND DRIP INCREASED TO 3:1, 12 LEAD, TRANS CARE TO ER MD AND STAFF

It hurt all night and still is hurting today. It is hurting about 4 inches from where they gave me shot. From my elbow down to my fingertips feels cold. I have coronary artery disease which means when my arm gets cold like that it means I have a blood flow issue. I have two stints and I have triple bypass surgery. The pain is constant pain in the upper arm.    I sent an email over to my primary care doctor yesterday. I was advised by Oncologist advised me to get the vaccine.

Sat down, and next thing I knew I has fainted (approx 7:45-8a).  Police were called, then First Aid Squad.  Very pale, sweaty and nauseous (threw up 2x).  Went to Hospital.  Was evaluated in the ED for approx 6 hrs, then transferred to a room for overnight observation.

Wife heard a loud crash and found me in bathtub.  I don&#39;t recall falling but shower curtain fell down and have minor neck and back discomfort at this time.  Wife assisted me to crawl out of tub and she reported I &#34;passed out&#34; two more times for short durations as I crawled back into bed. Had profuse cold sweating episode for about 15 minutes.  Much less weakness now at 10 am, no dizziness but still a mild headache.

Pt said he was so weak he fell out of bed and was on the ground for approx. three hours until he was able to get up. He has had nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. He came into the ER complaining of shortness of breath and chest pressure. Pt has received Normal Saline fluid, chest x ray and is being admitted to the hospital for acute renal failure.

                                                Day after first shot, experienced  some arm pain, elevated temperature, chills, very tired.  Of concern, blood pressure spiked to 149/78 (usually 120/70) and stayed elevated all day.  I contacted my cardiologist  late in the afternoon and he advised me to come in if the blood pressure did not return to normal the next day.  The next day, all symtoms disappeared and I felt normal.  When I received my second shot yesterday the doctor giving the injection said the blood pressure spike after the first shot was unusual and asked me to submit a VAERS  report.  My symptoms after the second shot  were a much more significant loss of mobility in the arm, which has returned to near normal.   but no blood pressure issue

                                                10 days after first dose of Moderna vaccine, I developed a very sore arm  starting with sharp pain at injection site and progressively radiating throughout upper arm and shoulder area, severe enough that I could not raise or use my arm.  This lasted about 24 hours and then started to dissipate throughout the next 24 hours.  I thought this was unusual because it was so long after the injection happened, and at the time of vaccination I had experienced very little arm pain.

He had a hard time breathing as well so he went to the hospital.  They checked him out and ran tests but it was all in relation to the shot they thought.  Saturday he was very tired that he slept all day.  Sunday he was feeling better but had some issues with his vision and his peripheral vision went away for part of the day.

                                                Got shot Friday afternoon and reaction started Saturday night. Injection site had a blue coloration about 1/4 inch and began feeling like 1.5 inch of pencil was in my arm. I was feeling very warm and cold at the same time with a normal core temperature. Extreme pain on any movement of arm that caused to muscle to tense. Having a fan on me  really help my heat/cold sensation be normal.  Most of symptoms went away Sunday afternoon, pain in arm reduced and I felt lethargic but OK. Pain in arm had subsided a lot and just felt like injection pain. most range of movement pain free but it did hurt if I moved my left arm up across my chest. Monday morning  had no issues with anything and injection site had no pain on movement or touch. I could just tell I had the shot there and the discoloration was lighter.

Continued eating and drinking fluids. I cancelled all other activities. I have not fully recovered but approximately 45 hours after the injection, the symptoms subsided.

My other two really bad reactions were as follows: Eight hours after shot I was shivering and cold no matter how many clothes I put on or how high I turned up the heat. This lasted 6 more hours. One hour after the shivering stopped I was overheated and sweated PROFUSELY. This lasted another 8 hours. Then the overheating and sweating just stopped and I was fine. Ps. my sister and I got the same shot, same Lot#, same day and she had the same shivering for 6 hours but not the sweating.

About 10pm, about 9 hours post injection, I was feeling weak and fatigued.  I went to bed and was starting to feel chilled, but not shaking.  I hopped into bed and turned on my electric blanket in a room that was 75° (from passive solar house heating during the day) and wearing only a T-shirt, sweat shirt, and sweat pants.  The first post-vaccination symptom I experienced was when I laid down and my right upper arm (at the point of the injection) was very sore; it was too painful to lie on my right side.  The injection area felt hard. I fell asleep about 11pm and woke up about midnight; I am generally a very light sleeper, rarely sleeping more than ~3± hours (most less than) at a time.  At 1:30am, I could not sleep so I watched a recorded movie.  All the while, I was feeling progressively worse.  About 2:30am, I felt really chilled, so I cranked up the electric blanket to its highest setting and put on some heavy wool socks, a pair of long-johns under my sweat pants, put on another heavy sweatshirt over my existing sweatshirt, and placed another blanket on top of my electric blanket: very cold / chilled but not shivering.  The movie ended about 3am, and my stomach was excruciatingly aching.  I did not feel I could eat anything which I really felt a need to do, but was concerned that I would just vomit.  However, I did take two, 500mg Tylenol tablets with a half a glass of water.  I might have slept for an hour or so, but was quite restless.  I remember looking at the clock at 4:00am.  By 5am, it was considering calling 911; my stomach ached so badly.  It was then, that I had the feeling / recollection I had this &#34;illness&#34; before.  About 5:30am, my stomach symptoms started to ameliorate; by 7:30am, they were gone.  However, I still felt miserable.  I then wondered whether my stomach symptom was just a concomitant bout with &#34;stomach flu&#34; where I experienced (severe) abdominal cramps and pain; nausea; and low-grade fever.  I have had the stomach flu a limited number of times before and, after 6± hours, it all went away: I just had to suck it up in the meantime.  Before I filled out this report, I wanted to consider whether my stomach flu was a reaction to the vaccination or incidental to the vaccination.  However, after talking with my neighbors and my sister&#39;s friend, who also had the Moderna vaccination, three of the four &#34;victims&#34; had similar symptoms to me.  Thus, I deduced I did not have a bout with stomach flu.  Additionally, a dog walking partner, who is a rescue worker, also noted folks she knew also had similar symptoms with the Moderna vaccine.  I then started wondering what kind of artificial cocktail, a.k.a.: antifreeze, was the suspending medium for the vaccine.  If this has to be stored at absurdly low temperatures I commonly have negative reactions to artificial chemicals.  The minor surgeries I have had are uneventful but for the anesthesia chemical concoction I am given.  I commonly takes me more then 2-3 days to detoxify that and feel normal.&#39;  As in this case, I pretty much laid in bed for the next 2½ days, with no energy or desire to attend to personal issues, including walking my dogs.  However, my subclinical temperature was pretty much gone after the second day.  The notable soreness in my arm was mostly gone after two days, but the injection point was still sensitive to pressing on top of the injection site: I could still feel it.  I have a very high tolerance for pain and have never experienced anything like this.  &#34;Pain&#34; from flu, etc., shots rarely, if ever, lasts more than 10-15 minutes post injection.  There was definitely something in the suspension media that reacted with my body chemistry / biological processes.  I am NOT looking forward to the booster shot; most seem to have a reaction to the second shot that is worse than the first  unless their first shot was uneventful and the second shot had considerably milder reactions than my first shot.  The next time I will definitely have a bowl or two of jell-O in the refrigerator to help quell any (expected) gut reactions; jell-O has always been a comfort food for me in those situations. What a horribly designed survey.  This is next to impossible to complete online.  After timing out twice, I had to start over and opted to download the fillable form PDF.  Even then, I am not given the option to select the subdirectory _where_ it should be downloaded.  Fortunately, I saw the option to open it directly. If you are going to make the &#34;adverse reaction&#34; field so limited, relative to field size and the absurd online time limit, how can you expect meaningful, complete reporting of post-vaccination reactions?  This form CANNOT be fully completed in the time allotted without timing out.  This is, most certainly, a deterrent to adverse reaction reporting.  One has to wonder how many folks just gave up after getting timed out the first time. With this kind of disincentive, how good or complete or meaningful is the adverse data collection procedure?  Have you purged all the supporters?  They do not like real, accurate, objective data, particularly information that is not consistent what they want to believe or the narrative they want to spin.  No respectable scientist or decent journalist would accept third-rate data.  How can public interest decisions be made with a shoddy data collection effort?

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

                                                First injection caused month long numbness in left shoulder. Took advil and tylenol that were recommended for my pain and reaction that did very little for month. Second injection caused immediate rash, then more numbness in left shoulder and then electric nerve vibrations from shoulder to wrist to this day another month later after second injection.

The patient stated that he got up to walk after a few minutes and the spasms slowly stopped. He states that his legs feel &#34;odd&#34; now, but cannot put to words the feelings. States that it feels like what he would imagine restless leg syndrome to feel like.

                                                He received his vaccine, had a sore arm and that evening around 7 hours later it was as if a switch flipped he was not able to breath, and his wife noticed on his body she could see all his veins like a track on his trunk and everywhere.  He could not talk.   He said that he was burning up, was hot and clammy.  He got in the shower to cool himself down, and was told that the oxygen was not getting to where it was supposed to go.  His wife called 9-1-1 and the EMT&#39;s said that his oxygen had dropped down into the 60&#39;s. He went to the hospital and they said he had pulmonary edema that filled his lungs that quickly.  He was not intubated, and is on a BiPAP.  He was given Lasix, steroids, antibiotics trying to pull the fluid off of his lungs.  He has had so many different scenarios from people at the hospital right now and at one time one of his nurses said that his blood work showed a possible blood clot.  They looked at his lungs and they said that they did not see it in his lungs.  Then they said that he had a heart attack and that he needed a valve replacement.  Today, 3/25/21 they told him that he did not have a heart attack, did not need a valve replacement.  Last night they said that his BP was dangerously high and today, his BP is fine.  He also had an adverse reaction to the steroids and had a ROID rage from that as well giving the nurses and his wife a hard time, hanging up the phone on her, and said that he was leaving the hospital.   He was fine prior to the vaccine, and does not have any other issues for him to have this reaction.  He is in ICU and they keep saying that they are going to put him in a cardiac care unit.  He has a lot of IV lines and his 2nd COVID test came back negative.   He feels like they are just running test to get money out of him.  They said that he may be able to go home tomorrow.

                                                His symptoms began at 9PM of the day of the second dose of Moderna vaccine (gat 10AM 3/11/2021. He was well prior to the vaccine. He had no antecedent infection like the previous events of asthma attacks. He took Zyrtec the night before and the day of the vaccine of both doses of the vaccine.  He has not been any asthma medication for six years except 3-4 uses of albuterol during the fall Wildfire season. Vaccine lot numbers: 1st 041LZ0A, 2nd  003AQ1A. H ehad similar incident in 2012 after Reclast second dose. Had flushing first and then asthma flare. Lasted a couple weeks with just inhalers then had to do prednisone to calm it down. When tapered off he relapsed and had to do three iterations over a couple months.  After the second vaccine on Thursday AM, he was well until about 9PM that night, he developed sore throat and coughing that progressed through the night. On Friday AM he started using his nebulizer with albuterol and budesonide. His symptoms were manageable over the weekend. On Monday he coughed up a large collection of clear mucus and felt much better. On Wednesday 3/17, symptoms returned with cough and shortness of breath. He was started on a single dose of prednisone 40 mg and on Thursday he was seen in clinic. His symptoms seemed to be a mix of laryngeal and chest irritation. He was given an 8-day tapering course of prednisone and albuterol-ipratropium nebs every 6 hours. On follow up 3/25, he was much better except for side effects of the steroids. He is still being followed so I will provide updates if there is some change. He had a very similar reaction to Reclast in 2012 but has tolerated all other vaccines previously.

Went to ER; they ran labs, did EKG, chest X-ray, covid test (negative).  Their conclusion was unspecified virus.  The next day he had slight fever and body aches, with pins and needles pain in arms and back.  Still having difficulty urinating.  Next morning still unable to urinate and having severe pain in abdomen.  Very weak and unable to walk.  We called 911 and had him transported to ER.  They inserted catheter and drained his bladder, attached bag to his leg.  Their diagnosis was inflamed prostate.  They did not address his weakness and inability to stand.  He was instructed to see his primary physician and a urologist after the weekend.  As that day progressed, he became unable to control his left leg.  By the next morning, he couldn&#39;t move either leg.  Called 911 and he was transported back to ER.  They attempted to do an MRI but the machine broke down.  He was transferred to a medical center that evening, where he had an MRI and was admitted.  The initial diagnosis was inflamed spine, but the 2nd day the neurologist told us he had a spinal stroke.

                                                ? A new stroke 24 hours after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccination Moderna  On Tuesday April 6, 2021 the patient showered by himself, walked up and down stairs in the home and was able to walk with the assistance of a cane.  He received the Moderna vaccination second dose at 10:00am (I believe this was an adverse event caused by the vaccination)  Wednesday April 7th at approximately 1:30pm I noticed he was unresponsive prompting me to call 911. His MRI at Hospital clearly diagnosed him as having another stroke, causing patient to no longer walk and use the restroom without assistance.  He is still in the hospital. Hospitalization and Physical Therapy is needed to allow patient to continue practicing as an Attorney.

He developed seizure disorder as well and had some mild seizures at home over the prior month. He received the vaccine at 4pm and was monitored in the office for 15 minutes. He then went home with his daughter whom he lives with. He ate dinner with her and read until 8pm when he went to his room. She found him in his room at 9pm unresponsive with seizures. Hospice was alerted and recommend oral valium. He continued to be unresponsive and expired the following day at 7:30 pm.

Tylenol was finally able to reduce the fever, but the next day it rose to 102,  and the following day also to 102, still having pains in his legs. On day 4, his oxygen level dropped to 80 (he did have congestive heart failure exactly one year ago, but it was corrected in ten days and his oxygen level had been perfect until the vaccine). We are now on day 6 and his oxygen is slowing improving after increasing Lasix. His body had an awful shock with this vaccine which medical people feel contributed to him almost sinking to congestive heart failure again. Even with all his medications he presents as a healthy individual usually.

                                                On the evening of the 15th day after my vaccination and a couple of hours after reporting once again that I was perfectly fine, I had a sudden shaking of my body which lasted about 30 minutes. it was so bad I couldn&#39;t hold a glass of water without spilling it. I got up and walked around, did some deep breathing, tucked my hands under my armpits and tried to resume watching TV. After about 30 minutes it calmed down but did not go away. I wasn&#39;t chilled. my temp was 100. I took to Tylonal and went to bed, shivering. Earlier this same day, around 4pm, I had started dry coughing quite bit but didn&#39;t think much about it. In the morning, after a restless night, my temp was 99. I felt sluggish, and weak but not sick. No activity, no walking that day of Saturday. Took 2 more Tylonal mid day. Temp was down to 98. That night, temp 98, I took Niqual and slept soundly. Sunday morning temp was 97.3 and I was feeling a lot better and continued to feel better to normal by Monday morning. A reaction to the drug 15 days after I thought was strange. I had no vaccination site redness or pain t any time. I wondered if I had actually contracted the virus. I&#39;m ok now.

I woke up to a tingling numbness feeling from four inches distal to my lower left wrist to the bilateral tip of my left baby finger and the left side of my left ring finger.  As I further woke I felt a warm numbing feeling: 1) from the lower left wrist to a point distal to the left elbow, 2) to the deep left side of my neck, 3) under the left corner of the left eye causing a very minor amount of extra tearing on the left side of the eye and 4) my left forehead to an alignment to the right corner of the left eye.

                                                2/16/2021:  Telephone call to PCP/DR: I.  This is all a little strange. Especially with the fever. I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.  He was told to go back on Mycophenolate which he started on Friday. Left hand pain from palm to wrist on Saturday.  Some shoulder pain on the left and right side.  Sunday pain got worse.  Went to the ER at hospital yesterday.  Dx&#39;d with carpal tunnell syndrome and gave him a wrist brace. He is taking tylenol/ibuprofen (200mg two tabs q 8 hours) as directed. Temp was 99.8 yesterday.  Temp is 99.5 this morning altho he is taking ibu/tylenol as directed. His wife reports he has traveling pain.  Today is pain is in the Right hand and right shoulder.  No left sided pain today.  Today he is able to hold a spoon in the left hand. He had a &#34;real rough night last night&#34;, didn&#39;t sleep much. She has called Rheum but hasn&#39;t heard from them. Okay to put him in with NP? For ER follow up?  Or should something else be done? 2/19/2021: Call to office PCP/DR. His wife called saying that he went to the emergency room for severe pain in his left hand and swelling he could not hang on to anything.   The pain started on Friday and kept getting worse all weekend . The er told him that it was carpel tunnel and gave him a wrist splint.  His wife says that she call his rheumatologist and they started him on prednisone 40 X 3 days, 30 X3 days, 20 X 3 days, 10 for 3 days then stop.  She states that now he is having traveling pain it went into his left shoulder and arm. Now it is in his right shoulder and hand the right hand is very swollen can not make a fist. This am she states that he is limping on the right leg the cord in the back is very painful,  She then states that now that she thinks about it over a week ago in the evening he told her several nights that he was having difficulty swallowing first it was on the left side then the right side of his throat he did salt water gargles and was fine in the morning but it has continued to come back every night she states now he is saying that it fells like there is something in his throat.  Since yesterday it is on the left side of his throat.  She is call the rheumatologist but wonders what you think. 2/19/2021: OV with PCP see previous.

                                                Possible MSG reaction, probably aggravated after vaccination.   Had meal approx. 1 hour before vaccination.   After vaccination (roughly 45 minutes), felt &#34;foggy&#34; feeling, akin to being drunk.   After looking for possible links to vaccine, and given that the reaction seemed like a strong reaction previously attributed to  MSG, searched the ingredients listed by the caterer and found that a side dish listed MSG.   ~~  Drove home without incident.  &#34;Foggy&#34; feeling dissipated after a few hours.   No significant reaction to the vaccine itself except slightly sore arm.

I try and walk 3 miles every day, but began to notice left leg discomfort and slight pain from my hip to my ankle when walking.  Do not notice this discomfort when sleeping or if my leg is propped up.  Feet are both fine and my right leg is fine, no pain.   Also notice that it is harder and slower getting out of bed in the morning and I get drowsy earlier at night than I used to.  By 9 PM I feel like I want to go to bed.

In particular it was kind of cramped up and stiff when I woke up in the morning.   Two days after my second Covid vaccine on Feb 8,   those symptoms became much worse.   My hand was very stiff in the morning and I couldn&#39;t straighten my index finger except by pulling it up with my other hand.  Prior to receiving the Covid vaccines, I had never experienced these issues before.

                                                After an adverse reaction to the Covid 19 Vaccine, the emergency room Doctor suggested I contact you for a follow-up visit.   Dateline and symptoms:  03/01 Received first Moderna Covid Vaccination at 3:45 p.m... 03/02 No symptoms until 6 p.m. When blood pressure started to go up from my normal level of 116/68 to 179/82 by 10 p.m..  During this time I had what felt like mild electric currents from the left side of my chest down my left arm and into my hand.  These systems subsided around 11 p.m. and by midnight my blood pressure was almost back to normal. 03/03 Felt sluggish all day but no blood pressure problems. 03/04 Felt great all day then around 6 p.m. my blood pressure started to rise, by 9:30 p.m. it was 190/90.  At this time I started to feel like my body was shutting down, my face felt flush, and experiencing long distant vision problems, so I had my wife take me to the emergency room. At 10:00 p.m. I went to the emergency room  EKG  showed no heart problems, the blood test showed no heart problems, and after 11:30 p.m. my blood pressure started going down and I was released at 1:30 a.m..  Blood test did show high levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen 26.0, Bun/Creatinine Ratio 33.0, Aspartate Amino Tranf (AST/SGOT) 43, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) 59 and Alkaline Phosphatase 189, all of which are higher than my last blood test on 10/22/20. 03/05  As of 10:30 a.m. my blood pressure is 126/62.  I feel fine except I&#39;m very tired from not much sleep last night.  1p.m. Starting to feel some more chest and arm symptoms as described before, blood pressure now 146/66. Events happened twice, 2 days apart.

At 3:00pm I experienced a surge  of heat in my body and my blood pressure dropped to 76/38 - pulse 38.  I was  not able to stand.  My wife called 911 and the EMT&#39;s came and confirmed the low  blood pressure.  They took me to Hospital where Dr.  did extensive tests including blood, head CT, Chest Xray, forearm Xray.  None  of these tests revealed a reason for the drop in pressure. Dr.  said, &#34;  well I suppose you can write this off to the vaccine&#39;.  My blood pressure  returned to normal on its own, no medication was administered at the hospital.   The Blood pressure has returned to normal within the next 48 hours and

Fortunately, the vomiting relieved the nausea, and Acetaminaphen broke the fever. Happily, after a very long night&#39;s sleep, the only remaining side effects are continuing fatigue and slightly sore arms.  Note: Form did not allow me to answer below about mild side effects from second shingles vaccine dose I had during the past year. Effects included chills, mild fever, headache, body aches, fatigue. The shots were given at the pharmacy in our local store, but I don&#39;t recall the date our other details.

                                                Severe fatigue, severe muscle aches, severe to moderate periodic itching\ pin prick sensations especially in palms of hands, soles of feet, and occasionally elsewhere on my body (e.g., inner ear, trunk, arms). The muscle aches and pin prick sensations have awakened me repeatedly for the past two nights, resulting in poor sleep. After 2 1/2 days, the fatigue and muscle aches are mostly gone, but the itching\pin prick sensations (somewhat like the sensations one gets with a case of shingles, which I had once 25&#43; years ago, or when warming extremities after being exposed to extreme cold) are still intermittently present.

He took Tylenol every 4-5 hrs. &amp; stayed in bed. By Sunday his fever slowly started to go down.  And by the following  Mon. morning, 3/8/21, his fever was gone.  He felt weak but otherwise well enough to perform normal day-to-day activities/work.  12 days after that, on 3/20/21, he developed the exact same symptoms &amp; went to bed immediately &amp; took appropriate Tylenol.  His fever, this time, only went to just under 100.  He is scheduled for his second shot on 4/2/21.  Should he get it?  If not, what does he do???

                                                My father received the first Covid shot 3/2; he woke up 3/3 with severe body aches and weakness, which we thought nothing of.  However, every day, he got weaker and weaker. He has been treated for Liver cancer, he received his first infusion of Opdivo almost 4 weeks before the vaccination.  About 7 days after the shot, he was having trouble swallowing so he went to the ER to get a CT scan. He was found to have greatly elevated troponins, the DR was baffled he wasn?t having any chest pain; they were apparently not trending either., he has never had a heart attack or any other heart problems, takes Nadolol for high blood pressure. The CT scan showed significant growth of his tumors  which had been stable for a year and the last CT scan was the end of January; liver enzymes were also significantly elevated whereas they were stable before.  My father deteriorated rapidly, and died on 3/18/21. The day he got the shot just prior, he was hauling wood, shoveling snow and living a normal life feeling good. The day after the shot he could barely get out of bed he was so weak, until he finally died 16 days later.

                                                On 3/24 by 9:25 PM I had mild shakes. At about 10:00 PM my lips stared to tingle and become numb. Subsequently I began to have difficulty swallowing as well as experiencing some sub sternal pain. Went to get my Epipen and put it beside me in bed. Difficulty swallowing got a bit worse but as I was not experiencing shortness of breath I held off the Epinephrine injection. (What on earth was I thinking?!)The &#34;semi anaphylaxis&#34; was self limiting and by 11:00 PM symptoms had subsided completely. But by approximately 11:30 MP I had severe rigors lasting about 3 - 5 minutes. On 3/25 I developed a severe headache and a low grade T (T-max 99.9). Took Tylenol 825mg with good effect. The following night I had severe night sweats, drenching 3 sets of pajamas. Today, on 3/26 I have been experiencing several cold sweats and I am altogether feeling &#34;strange&#34; (can&#39;t put my finger on it - maybe dehydration?). Have vegan to aggressively hydrate. Notified my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office. Agreed to &#34;ride it out&#34; for now. Shall see my PPP on

                                                How the Vaccine affected my Sleep Apnea  Diagnosed: Severe Sleep Apnea Obstructive &amp; Central 2 ½ years ago with 55 events/hour Machine: BiPap ResMed AirCurve 10 ASV with Memory Foam Full Mask  Vaccine: Moderna  My first shot had little effect with minimal soreness in my arm and a slight headache. The second shot had much more effect on me. I was very active the day of the second shot and the next day. Then it hit me hard. One of the greatest benefits of my Bi-Pap is how it works on my depression and anxiety. I was really sick with headaches, fever, no energy, body aches and really being in bed all day. Unfortunately the depression hit me also. It is like a lead blanket (like the dentist uses for x-rays) over you as you ball up in bed as your mind thinks why do I exist and how to end it with more feeling of anxiety. It really felt like I would die but knew from my experience that it may pass. Luckily it did but it took 10 days before feeling alive again. I also wondered why my events/hour increased at this time and concluded that the vaccine affected my Sleep Apnea.  My Data:  30 day average: 6.34 events/hour  90 day average: 4.64 events/hour 365 day average 3.89events/hour  As you see I have a good events/hour average but it has really increased this month since I got the Vaccine. Here are my numbers.  First Vaccine February 2021 18th  3.0 events/hour (day of shot) 19th  8.6 events/hour 20th  5.2 events/hour 21st  3.1 events/hour 22nd 2.2 events/hour  Second Vaccine March 2021 18th 4 events/hour (day of shot) 19th 6.8 events/hour 20th 15.5 events/hour 21st  5 events/hour 22nd 7.1 events/hour 23rd  5.3 events/hour 24th  5.2 events/hour 25th  6.9 events/hour 26th  3.6 events/hour 27th  2.9 events/hour

Unclear when began to feel bad. 3/11/2021  9:07 pm EMS transported to Hospital Center ED for altered mental status following vaccination. ED physician note states &#34;70 y/o male with pmhx of CAD, CVA, HTN, DM, myopathy and DVT on  Xarelto presents to ED with complaints of generalized weakness and change in mental status onset yesterday. Patient received his COVID vaccine yesterday and since then, patients wife is concerned he is not behaving himself and appears confused. Wife is also concerned he has a deceased appetite and decreased PO intake. Patient has no complaints at this time. Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain and back pain. HPI is limited due to patients mental status.&#34;  4/3/2021 when being scheduled for follow-up dose on 4/7/2021 his wife informed us &#34;He had a bad reaction  to the first dose of the vaccine, had to go to the hospital, was admitted and had to stay for 3 days does not want the 2nd dose.&#34;  4/3/2021 Dr (one reporting) checked system and talked to wife to obtain this history. Agreed with her that he should not receive the second dose due to how badly he felt after the first. In addition, his prior history of COVID likely gives him sufficient protection against COVID-19.

I hobbled/hopped to the hall calling out to my wife and  slid along the wall to the floor rubbing my leg and calf. After a few minutes I regained mobility and have not had that same experience. I have hadintervals of sharp aching in the hip joint and calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to experience a numbness/tingling from the injection site to my elbow as well as along my left leg and a general weakness in my left arm. After waiting a few weeks to see if things would change,I reported it anecdotally to our Infection Control Nurse and she advised me to report to VAERS.

Was confused , trying to give me his remote to do what with I wasn&#39;t sure.  He had trouble with getting ideas across.  I wasn&#39;t sure if this was normal for him.  However, we called him this morning at 8:45 am and he was lucid, he stated that when he went home around 4 pm , his left arm , hand and face were numb.  He stated that he could not pick up his cap with his left hand.  Today he woke and feels normal.  He was lucid and able to present ideas in a normal manner.  He vaguely remembers coming back to the clinic yesterday.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient let me know that he had a warm sensation  from the injection site up to the left side of his neck and tightness of the left side of his neck.  I asked if he felt like his throat was closing and he said no.  At this time, I gave the patient a diphenhydramine tablet 25 mg tablet and a bottle of water and observed him.  I took the patient&#39;s blood pressure about 10 minutes later and it was 170/75. I asked if this was a normal level for him and he said when he took it last week it was 180 over something.  I continued observing the patient and took his blood pressure again in 10 minutes. It was in the same range. The patient left approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine. He said that he was feeling better.  I called the patient to follow up at 3 pm. I asked if he was feeling better. He said, &#34;I think I&#39;m ok.&#34; I asked if he was still experiencing the symptoms from earlier and he said, &#34;No, I left those symptoms in Massillon.&#34;

All went well between the time I got the shot to the time I went to bed at about 10PM. I thought I had it made. At midnight I awoke with intense shivering. I absolutely couldn&#39;t stop. I wasn&#39;t cold as my body was hot. I had plenty of covers, but I was hot and shivering cold. Include a severe headache in this picture. This went on for a good hour and I finally settled down and dozed off again. This morning I have a mild headache and a really sore shoulder where I received the vaccine.

                                                At first I only had a sore arm. By early Friday evening, the night after the vaccination, I began having severe steady pain in my left kidney, along with sharp shooting pain at the same location.  I also had the expected headache and fatigue. I took Tylenol during this time, and still am. I was pretty much totally bed-ridden for 4 days.  I called my doctor on Wednesday, February 17th to report the severe reaction in my left kidney. The nurse told me that as long as I felt better each day then to weather it out and get  the second shot (scheduled for March 11).  Although I am feeling a little better, I am still taking Tylenol for the pain in my kidney. My exhaustion is lessening.

It sort of came in mild waves over the course of 2 to 3 hours. Never really disabled me just bothersome and made me want to just sit. Symptoms seemed to disappear after I ate supper.  I felt fine the next morning save fore some soreness just below the injection site.

He couldnt put words together to make a sentence.  He got up to go into the kitchen and then urinated all over himself.  He was worried about falling sleep, scared he would die in his sleep.  The 3rd woke up and was feeling some better but still foggy headed.  Pt went to the ER about 5 days later.  They did a CT and blood work.  He thinks the tests results came back negative. They wanted him to stay longer and maybe see a Neurologist but since there wasnt one available to see at that time the pt decided to go home.  He has blood work and urine labs to be done at the facility on 2/23/2021.  Pt states he is feeling better at this time.

Client verbalized understanding. Completed administration of IM shot in right deltoid (original dose discarded/wasted appropriately. New syringe and needle used, 0.5 ml administered in right deltoid). Client denied any pain, numbness, tingling, or other sensation.  Attempted to contact patient on 3/3/2021 at 9:14 AM to follow up. No answer. Left voicemail to return call. No return call as of 3/3/2021 4:12 PM. Will attempt to contact again within this week.

The symptoms were mild and did not require any pain medication. The visible symptoms at day 15 were mostly gone.

Sitting at home talking with my wife ant two friends and started feeling &#34;dizzy&#34;. They said I started shaking and head rolled back and I was out for a minute. I did not know anything had happened when I opened my eyes.  They insisted that I go to the hospital.  EMS came and tested me on the way to hospital- all tests good. Same at the hospital- you may have the results.   Not a seizure, no high blood pressure, maybe vaccine reaction? they weren&#39;t sure what it was, and wanted to keep me overnight and I said no thanks. Home about 5 PM I feel fine.  Please let me know if you want to go over.

                                                felt so bad; severe chest pain; Chest pain and arm pain; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning her husband, a 71-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced abnormal feeling, severe chest pain,  and arm pain.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included the patient had a heart attack on 26 May 2020 and on October 2020 the patient had five bypass, two arteries they took. Since October the patient&#39;s condition was stated to be great. Concomitant medications reported included Insulin Bovine, Multivitamins [vitamins Nos], acetylsalicylic acid and Medication related to patient&#39;s heart attack.  On 12 Feb 2021, unspecified days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:007M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Feb 2021, post receiving mRNA-1273, the patient had no reaction and did not feel bad.  On unspecified day in Feb 2021 one week prior to the reporting the events, the patient experienced chest pain and arm pain, minimum that lasted for 10 minutes. 3 or 4 night prior reporting the event, the patient was feeling abnormal, went to ER and was hospitalized with severe chest pain. The patient was in a regular room and was transferred to ICU. Next day, Cardiac catheterization was performed to see the patient&#39;s heart and found that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing.  Treatment for the event, severe chest pain included morphine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event of arm pain was considered Recovered/Resolved.  The events, abnormal feeling, severe chest pain were considered as unknown. The patient is still hospitalized.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71-year-old, male patient, who experienced severe chest pain, feeling abnormal. Cardiac catheterization was performed which showed that 3 arteries in the original surgery were failing. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time. The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack (May 2020) and bypass (October 2020) confounds the causality. Further information has been requested.

                                                I received part one of the Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine  on  March 10, 2021 at 8:11 a.m.. The next day on March 11, 2021 3:00 pm  I had a bad reaction to the Moderna vaccine which was sudden onset of loss of mental clarity. Could not remember how old I was or even what decade I was born in, could not remember my passwords, what TV show I watched last night, the name of the place where I got vaccinated. I have never experienced loss of mental clarity before. The physical symptom was a sore arm. I went to bed early and woke up fully recovered, mentally restored and normal.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after injection, I started to feel chilled and began shaking and shivering. No fever. Felt general malaise. No appetite. Developed bad headache which prevented sleeping. The next day, it seemed this was over, but still had no appetite and in the evening the shaking and shivering resumed. Developed another bad headache that prevented sleeping again. Next morning  (today) still no appetite and continued to feel cold. Have eaten some even with no appetite, so I could take ibuprofen which seemed to help a bit.

It improved over next week only to reappear after second vaccine and in this case took 6 weeks to disappear. It was painful and verified by two dentists who saw lesion.  I also develop three days after second vaccine, pain in right calf region and numbness in my right foot involving lateral toes and heel region. the pain disappeared within hours but the numbness has remained, now 6 weeks ater though is less than initially,   After both the first and second vaccinations, I had hemorrhagic sinusitis that lasted at least two weeks with significant drainage resulting in cough.   I had two negative Covid tests after first vaccine to confirm this was vaccine related and I had not contracted Covid.

                                                Very red rash in AXILLA of the right arm, not painful or itchy, but very red covering whole arm pit and petechiae surrounding3-4 inches around the axilla area.  First noticed it 3 weeks or so after the first injection. Treated with benadryl spray/cream topically and oral to help with sleep. Not painful at first, but did develop an itching and painful area after a few days. It is now March 16th and right  arm pit is STILL red.  I had thought it was an insect bite, but did not act like that and it has  eased up, bit not gone away.  It was not until a week AFTER the Second Moderns shot in the opposite left arm  that a rash developed on the LEFT armpit/axilla area did it occur to me that it may be vaccine related and should be reported.  I have pictures.

Malaise and tremors continued for about 2 hours (approx) until sleep at about 9:30. The next day, tremors completely resolved but malaise and tiredness continued. This mostly resolve after 2 days, but notable I became tired more easily for the next couple of days, with no other change in routine. My wife, who received a vaccination at the same time (and from the same lot) as I did suffered similar symptoms but hers resolved somewhat more quickly and did not apparently last over days.

                                                I spoke on 03/09/2021 with a question from him. He received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine as Moderna on 02/16/2021. He reports he did well with his shot initially and didn&#39;t really even have a sore arm. About 6-7 days after his vaccine, however, he started getting some significant redness, warmth, tenderness and then swelling in his arm that continued to worsen. became concerned that his reaction was more than would be normally expected so he was seen by a doctor who diagnosed him with cellulitis and started him on antibiotics and steroids. He had completed his antibiotics at the time of our conversation and said his arm felt better but was still slightly red. His doctor recommended that he not get a second dose of Moderna, but suggested that he might get a Pfizer or a Janssen vaccine instead, and was wondering about our recommendation for this? I let patient know that there are no specific studies for the interchangability  of these vaccines but there is a statement from CDC that says if an individual is unable to get a 2nd dose of an mRNA vaccine due to a contraindication, they could consider getting one dose of Janssen vaccine at least 28 days after the first dose to have a complete valid J&amp;J dose. I encouraged to speak with his provider about this possibility and any further action. I did some education on potential causes of cellulitis and let him know that per immunization guidance, cellulitis isn&#39;t necessarily a contraindication to a second dose of vaccine but more of a precaution as it can be difficult to know the exact cause and a second dose may not result in the same side effect. Several times reported no respiratory symptoms or other symptoms than the cellulitis. I again recommended him to speak with his provider for the best plan of action and he agreed to this.

                                                I had felt a little crummy overall the afternoon of my second shot, but nothing specific aside from a slightly sore arm. The next day my legs started to feel funky, but I had a strong 4 wheel rollator and I continued on to assist my wife with getting her first shot at . By the time we got to the  elevators, after walking about two blocks the legs were feeling worse. On the way out my wife noticed me walking poorly and after about one block my legs &#34;gave out&#34; completely and I collapsed.

Ambulance arrived and determined to take me to hospital after having 2nd syncope in their presence.  Remained in hospital overnight.  All vitals, heart and bloodwork were fine as seen by cardiac doctor and  determined it was dehydration.  Followed up with primary physician and told him I was urinating excessively.  He put me on Flomax 0.4 mg.  I had the 2nd Moderna shot on March 23rd and again was taken to the hospital on March 31st with same symptoms and near syncope and again was told it was clinical dehydration.  They told me to drink a combination of pedialite and water which I have been doing and I am still experiencing the dizziness, lightheadedness and weakness.  Woke up on April 4th and felt like my soul was being ripped from my body.  I honestly thought I was going to die. Looked on line and found forums of people experiencing similar symptoms.  Went to pharmacy and they recommended meclizine and have taken a clonipin for anxiety.  I am feeling better now, but worried about how long I will be experiencing these symptons.

                                                ( I am a physician )First 24-36 hours noted minimal site discomfort. On 1/1/21 @ 6 PM with dinner noted some difficulty chewing food and minor sensation on right lower lip. As evening progressed it was noticeable a small right facial droop and distorted smile. By 1/2/21 5 AM, facial droop was more noticeable as well as distorted smile. So I decided to to ED to be checked out.ED MD was contemplating between unusual presentation of Bell&#39;s Palsy, small stroke or COVID 19 presentation. Vitals except for slightly elevated BP (145/85) were NLas well as lab ( see below). PEx: tender area posterior to R Jaw. So left with Right madibular trigeminal inflammation ( limited Bell&#39;s Palsy) and consideration for steroids. I opted NO steroids since I wanted to COVID vaccine response. Since it was a holiday weekend, I finally got to talk to my PCP on 1/4/21 ( Dr, from Internal Medicine at Hospital) who agree with me n no steroids. Also no vaccine until we see course and newer recommendations over next few weeks from CDC. I am being monitored with CDC text messaging but have not received a call from them yet. since 1/1/2021 there has been improvement in that there tenderness behind the right jaw is gone. There are no new symptoms but he weakness of right lower lip and eating issues persists. When a move water around in my mouth with closed lips , it tends to leak on right side. I am hoping for full recovery but time will tell. Summary of ED physician assessment from 1/2/21 Medical Decision Making  Patient seen by me on:  1/2/2021 Assessment:  72 year old male presenting with right sided facial weakness. No paralysis on exam but mildly notably weaker on R side. Otherwise, neurologically intact on exam. Differential diagnosis:  Bell&#39;s Palsy, Incomplete Bell&#39;s Palsy, CNS lesion, vaccine adverse effect, lymphadenopathy Considered CVA, not a TPA candidate based on timing and minor deficits. May need to obtain MRI to evaluate. Plan:  EKG, basic labs Discussed with patient, who is a physician, given risk factors and not classic Bell&#39;s Palsy, will proceed with MRI brain. ED Course and Disposition:  MRI unremarkable. I feel this adequately rules out stroke and CNS lesion as a cause of facial weakness. CBC, CMP unremarkable. Patient&#39;s exam remains stable. We discussed risks/benefits of steroids. Concerns being his diabetes as well as blunting immune response to vaccine. He has mild facial asymmetry but not complete and will hold off on steroids unless worsening symptoms. COVID testing sent as discussed with patient. He will return to ED or see PCP if symptoms worsen.  Dx- Bell&#39;s Palsy  01/02/21 1231

                                                When I received the vaccine I did not feel anything, 12hrs after the vaccine my arm suddenly became very sore. I developed severe chills and low grade fever, muscle and joint pain, my hands and feet were cold, headache, and uncontrolled yawning, I suppose my body&#39;s attempt to cool the brain. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and the symptoms mostly abated, but returned about 4hrs later. I am treating myself with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. I have not seen my PCP, I feel the symptoms will resolve with time, if not I will follow-up. I cannot find anything in the literature but do people that have had covid get a stronger reaction from the vaccine?

She was worried about an allergic reaction.  He did seem a little shaky.  They had him sit on a bench outside for fresh air.  He said this was helping.  I took his radial HR.  It was regular, 70 bpm.  I was unable to get his blood pressure due to a broken cuff.  He was feeling much better at that point.  He did eat breakfast.  He said his arm felt fine.  No rash or hives observed and no shortness of breath.   His case worker brought him some water.  We sat there for about 15 minutes.  He felt much better and the case worker said he seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.

Then, 12 days after the vaccination, a red rash started to be seen at the area where the injection was. That area felt warm. The nest two days, including today, the rash started to spread, covering a major part of the upper part of my arm. The arm is warm to the touch. I plan to go to a medical clinic tomorrow, as I am now, visiting my daughter and grandchildren, until January 24.

                                                Started with normal sore arm, ache, tired the day after.  These symptoms went on for a week.  Called Dr and they said they last longer in some people. By the week of the 11th my wife and I were both getting worse.  By Sunday morning, 1/10 we couldn?t get out of bed.  We tested positive for Covid around the 18th  My question is we are supposed to get our second vaccination on 2/3/21, a week from tomorrow.  Given the first vaccine, then testing positive for Covid, should we get the second shot as planned or should we try to delay a week or so to get more strength.  This report is identical for both my wife and myself.  Also, we mask, social distance, no restaurants, etc.  Thank you

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the vaccination I begin to feel itching, burning sensation in my left wrist area surrounding the site of the surgery on Jan. 4 for skin cancer.  This increased over the next few hours and by the next morning my lower forearm was involved.  The surgical site was about 2 inches long, stitches had been removed ten days before and the wound was mostly healed.  The rash extended from the wound site toward the wrist about 2 inches, radiated laterally along the length of the wound about 2 inches on either side and up into the upper forearm another 3 inches.  There were small blisters within the rash as well.  I initially tried a cortisone cream I had left over from a previous wound.  This seemed to inflame the rash even more and I stopped.  I then applied some of the antibiotic cream I used when the wound was fresh and actively treated.  This seemed to reduce the inflammation some.  After 2 days I contacted my dermatologist who prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1 % External Cream.  I have been taking this for 24 hours, 3 applications and the rash is beginning to dissipate.  My dermatologist  indicated I was the third patient to have a rash on the same arm with a surgery and a Moderna shot, in the same arm.

Felt just as bad as when  I had Covid 19.  Very little strength to get out of bed and slept all day into the night.  Took shot on Monday, then sick all day the following Tuesday.  On Wednesday I was better , but was still very fatigued and had mild headaches . By Thursday was back to normal.

After receiving  an EKG, a chest X-Ray, and a CT of the head, I was informed that I had developed Bell&#39;s Palsy.  I was then seen by Dr., Neurology who also confirmed.  I was then admitted to the hospital for observation and another CT of the head 24 hours after the first.  I was given Acyclovir 200mg and Prednisone 10mg. during my hospital stay and prescribed after discharge at approximately 5 PM on 2/5/21.  as of the date of this report, still experiencing same symptoms

                                                My arm was mildly sore at  the injection site for about 36 hours.  2/18/21 (Thurs.) ? In the morning (only) there were rashes on my L arm, my neck and my back. While I have had a few itchy pimple areas for several weeks, and am generally sensitive to everything, this is not the same. It is also not the same as the transient flushing that I have in my face for a few minutes each morning after I take 500 mg. of Niacin.   2/23/21 (Tues.) ? At 8:30 a.m. I had flushing (not quite a noticeable rash) on my back, face, shoulders and both arms, esp. the L arm. (This was 20-30 minutes after I had taken Niacin, but the brief flushing, just in my face, resulting from the Niacin was long gone before these other rashes/flushing occurred.) Later, after 9:00 a.m., there was warmth and itching on my lower back. At 9:45 a.m. I felt flushing in my thighs and lower legs. At 10:00 a.m. there was an actual red rash on my chest and stomach. This all seems unusual for one week after the CoVID-19 shot.     2/27/21 (Sat.) ? Starting at 9:50 a.m. (30 minutes after taking 500 mg. of Niacin, which usually results in immediate flushing of my face, for only a few minutes at most), I had flushing and itching, and a slight rash, on my upper chest and upper back. After a few minutes the flushing and itching spread to my lower back, and my upper arms; my upper arms had a noticeable rash, which then spread down to my hands. In the next few minutes the flushing, itching and rash extended to my upper inner thighs and lower back (although I am only assuming, based on the feeling of flushing and itching, that my lower back had a rash, since I couldn?t see there). Over the next several minutes the itching and rash extended to the front and side of my thighs, down to my knees. The rash then extended, to a lesser extent, down to my ankles. As of 10:50 a.m. I still have this flushing, itching and/or rash in all the places mentioned, although it has started to decrease. This was mostly gone by 12:00 p.m. Other than 4 days ago, I don?t think I have previously experienced this generalized reaction in my 73 years.

She reported that patient, was hospitalized a week after getting his first injection and stayed in the hospital for 3 days. She states he presented with confusion, weakness, shakiness and was thought to originally have had a TIA and then was diagnosed with metabolic encephalopathy. She states he is completely different and now has to walk with a walker and confusion persists.

                                                In Temporary VAERS E-Report Number 325084, I previously reported whole-body flushing, itching and rashes in the mornings 2 days, 7 days and 11 days after receiving my first Moderna CoVID-19 vaccination on 2/16/21. I now have another incident to report, occurring 16 days after the vaccination.    3/04/21 (Thurs.) ? Starting at 8:20 a.m. (20 minutes after taking 500 mg. of Niacin, which usually results in some immediate flushing of my face, for only a few minutes at most), I had flushing and itching, and a slight rash, on my upper chest. At 8:25 a.m. both arms were red, particularly on the inside of my elbows, as well as my shoulders. At 8:30 .am. my stomach was red and itching. At 8:35 a.m. I had itching and redness on my lower back and inner thighs. (Since I was just adding areas, without the previous areas of flushing, itching and rash going away, going away, my arms were now the reddest of any areas.) At 8:40 a.m. the redness and itching extended to the front of my legs, down to the shin, as well as my lower back. At 8:50 a.m. (by which time I was in a supermarket, without much chance to look at areas under my clothes for redness), the back of my hands were very red, and to a lesser extent my palms. At 9:00 a.m., the overall itching had increased further. At 9:10 a.m., my cheeks and the back of my neck felt flushed and itching. At 9:20 a.m., by which time I was home, my abdomen was very red and itching. At 9:50 a.m., I still had itching all over, esp. my abdomen. By 10:20 a.m. there was a decrease in overall itching and flushing. By 11:20 a.m. they were mostly gone, except for some itching in the small of my back. Today is 16 days after I had my first Moderna vaccination. I have never before experienced this overall reaction to anything, other than 2 days, 7 days and 11 days after the vaccination.

On 3/5/21 at 3:00 am woke from sleep with extreme chills, goosebumps on the skin, and physically shaking to warm up. I had on the bed a sheet, quilt, and heavy comforter. I used the toilet to urinate and was not sure that I could walk back to my bed due to nausea and weakness. After resting, I placed another wool blanket on the bed on top of the comforter. Eventually, I began to warm up. Nausea and fever continued.  Muscles and joints ached. I slept on and off until 7:00 am. I did not eat any breakfast due to continuing nausea. I drank coffee, sat in my reclining chair most of the morning. at 12:00 noon, I ate a bowl of potatte and chicken soup.  My tempereature at this time was 99.5. I did sleep in the afternoon. Later in the evening my temperture had gone down to 99.  Today, 3/06/21 at 8:00am, I feel normal, tired but normal.

                                                Primarily, extremely weak on the next day--in particular for several hours during the afternoon in which I lay down and did not wish to move.  Soreness and aching throughout my body, not unlike when one experiences influenza; however, I had no other flu symptoms, no nausea or indigestion.  There were occasional headaches, and a few times, light-headedness.  Weariness, and lack of physical drive continued, on and off, for another ten days.  On one day, one week later, during this period, I was able to function fairly normally, but I may have over-extended..  The next day, Friday, the weakness resumed.  Last night when I went to bed, I felt light-headed again, but slept soundly for seven hours.  Today, I feel much better, and I feel that I am returning to normal.

                                                Woke up around 2 AM on Saturday morning after the Friday morning shot --- fever/sweating, headache, felt like every bone and muscle in my body hurt. Felt like I had been hit by that truck everybody gets hit by. Fever broke some time during the night.  Pain subsided. Was able to eat breakfast about 9AM.  Very weak. Dozed on and off the rest of the morning.  Low grade fever most of the rest of the day. By Sunday morning felt pretty much normal, but still weak. By Monday morning pretty much back to normal.

I don&#39;t remember when exactly the fever started, but it last until the 36th hour after the vaccination.  It was 101.3 most of the time.  101.7 was the high point.  I also had stomach pain at that time.  After 3 days I was fine.  With the 1st shot I also had a sore arm, but not this bad.  I also ran a fever, but it was around 100 then.

Also had some abdominal cramping, which I often have due to colitis so probably unrelated to vaccine. Treated fever with acetaminophen at about 2 p.m., temperature went down to 98.7 but continued to have chills most of afternoon. Second morning after vaccination still have chills but milder. Temperature of 98.7 in morning. Not medicated.

He began falling over in the chair and seemed very pale. His wife was with him and myself and two customers in the store were helping to keep him awake. 911 was called and did arrive. He was barely speaking at first and then when he was given oxygen by 911 he began to come to. His wife was stating that he had not eaten today. Paramedics took him to the hospital, he was awake and conscious when they took him.

                                                Got the vaccine and had soreness in the arm and felt great, and on Saturday 3/6/21 late afternoon his head hurt to touch his hair.  He knew what it was from previous experience.  Was on the top of his head to the right rear predominantly, probably 4&#34; or so.  It was painful and tied into his right eye as he was photophobic with this as well and sunlight would affect that and would get a spasm of pain/2 second or so in the top of his head.  These events continued intermittently until Tuesday 3/9/21 when it was gone, but on his right tricep has a scraping sore feeling on it, which still continues as of today 3/16/21, but only faintly.

It came up the day after receiving the vaccine and has lasted 5 weeks and the Valicyclovere isn&#39;t working. it went away by 03/10/2021. I also experienced fever and weakness 03/06/21 and then when it resolved the herpes came up. Went to the doctor at a walk in clinic on 02/24/21 because I had high fever and nausea and weakness for about 10 hours. I got an infected tooth(root canal and crown on this tooth) and an infected jaw. Dentist put me on antibiotics and I have to have the tooth pulled. I went to the dentist on 02/11/2021.

                                                Besides expected head ache and slight fatigue, I woke up on the night of 3/17 (day 2 following 2nd vaccine dose) with extreme pain in my right big toe and foot, with some cramping in the right calf.  It was difficult to walk.  I stayed in bed most of the next day with right leg elevated, and using ice to help pain and swelling. My wife and I suspected Gout, however it would have been a first for me to have it.  By 3/19 it felt a little better, but right foot still swollen, and my wife and I noticed a pronounced vein from the right knee down. She got scared that it could be a blood clot, so we called Dr and he ordered ultra sound, which was done on 3/19 in afternoon, but technician said that saw &#34;nothing&#34;.  Today (3/20) foot still sore and it&#39;s hard to put wight on it still.

                                                Numbness in lower lip and numbness and slight trembling in right side of face (similar to Bells Palsy?) after four days of being administered the first shot in the right arm. After a video consult with my PCP it was recommended that I go to the hospital and get a CT scan to rule out a possible minor stroke. The CT scan was negative. The numbness became better after two weeks but has not subsided.  After consultation with the doctor in charge of the vaccine operation for the site it was decided that I go ahead and take the second shot but instead of the right arm I should take it in either the left arm or the left thigh. The second shot was administered in the left thigh. I experienced the typical symptoms on the second day - fever, chills and aches and pain but they went away towards the end of the second day. However, exactly on the fourth day I experienced increased numbness in my lower lip and on the right side of my face. Today is the fifth day and it is still there. I expect that this numbness will continue for several weeks as it did with the first shot and so far it has not subsided after the first shot and has now increased after the second shot. I am totally convinced that this is a direct result of the vaccine.

He had a clot in his brain and underwent brain surgery. He experienced seizures after the surgery, but it was ultimately reported the surgery went well. He remained intubated and on a ventilator after surgery. He developed complications of his lungs and kidneys while on the ventilator. Ventilator was removed 3/16/2021 and he passed away that day. The hospital providers thought the clot in the brain may have been from hitting his head over a month ago. From my understanding he was A&amp;O, independent with ADLs, and lived in his private residence prior to these complications.

                                                Patient was found deceased in his own home on Monday, March 15, 2021.  He was found on the floor in a sitting position with three fingers of his right hand on his right carotid.  It appeared that he was getting ready for church, which was a routine event.  Although patient was a diabetic, he never had episodes that were life threatening, and was always able to manage to remediate with insulin or food.  Patient last spoke to a neighbor at 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, March 14th, who said he appeared to be just fine and they scheduled a date with their dogs on Sunday afternoon.  A sheet of instructions found on the kitchen counter at the home informed us that he had a COVID vaccine at the VA Hospital on Wednesday, March 10th.  He was documenting side-effects of very sore  right arm and low blood sugars.  that was unusual because if he was able to manage he wouldn&#39;t have noted it.  It was apparent that something sudden happened such that he was unable to get to help and his heart rate must have been of concern.  We believe that patient suffered  onset of some sort of cardiac event, blood clot, high heart rate, or heart attack, that was associated with the vaccine on Wednesday and 4 days later he was suddenly gone, unable to call for help (he has family close by in this community).  We want healthcare providers and individuals to be able to make informed decisions about giving/taking the vaccine when there is another health issue  such as diabetes to consider.  We lost a brother, a father, a friend and a dedicated veteran unnecessarily.

Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous. Next is very hard to describe, my wife and daughter found me passed out on the kitchen floor. This lasted approximately 20 minutes until EMT arrived. I do not remember anything from that point. EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

She was fine after about a day.  My father reported  arm soreness and fatigue that lasted about three days after the shot.  He thought he was rebounding from the shot and continued his usual activities.  Though, he started complaining of being &#34;winded&#34; and difficulty breathing.  He slept a lot and continued with fatigue and shallow breathing.  A week after his shot he felt he needed to go to the ER because of difficulty breathing and being exhausted after walking up a flight of stairs (we live in a raised ranch style house).

                                                Moderna COVID19 vaccine EUA Woke up at night to go to the bathroom.  Had trouble getting out of bed and walking.  Joints were stiff.  Strangely my right hand was frozen open.  Was unable to make a fist or grasp a water bottle.  When I tried to close my right hand I had a weird sensation in my hand.  It felt like electricity flowing down my hand and into my 4 fingers.  Left hand was not effected.   Had the same effect when I woke up a couple times during the night.  When I got up on Saturday morning the problem with my hand was gone.  Still a bit stiff, was fatigued, headache and body aches.  Sore arm for a few days.

                                                I woke up at 3am on Wednesday  the 20th and felt very dizzy. Keep on going for about an hour or so. About 4AM I started to puke my guts out. I called the doctor about 9am that morning who told me that it was an effect from the vaccine (I had a virtual visit with the doctor). I was also feeling very weak. Today I feel I better and was able to eat and even take my dog for a walk.

No other symptoms.  24 hours latter it seems reddened somewhat compared to the right heal.  It is made worse with dorsiflexion of the foot or weight bearing.  It also appears a little swollen.  It does not feel warm to touch.  No sign of foreign body or history of any injury or new increased activity.

                                                MY REACTION TO THE FIRST DOSE: In March of 2020 I suffered Covid pneumonia and was on oxygen and too weak and short of breath to work for three months.  It took over seven months to return my breathing and strength to baseline. I just checked my lab and I still have IgG antibodies and a negative nasal screen for the virus. One month ago at 9 AM I received the Moderna Vaccine.  About 12 hours later I developed shaking chills and a fever of about 103, pain in my arm from the injection, and severe cough and a VERY WATERY RUNNY NOSE with severe post nasal drip which caused aspiration of the discharge.   I took Tylenol, Afrin Nasal Spray, and a Dulera inhaler and fell asleep.  I woke up at 3 AM and felt well, but at 4 AM I developed an intolerable intractable cough and severe watery nasal discharge lasting about two hours and severe dry heaves from the aspiration.  Afrin nasal spray helped somewhat but I was absolutely miserable for  two hours.    Three days ago I received the one month booster for the Moderna Vaccine at 10AM.   My arm began to become painful but it was tolerable and not relieved by Tylenol. Every time I rolled over at night the pain woke me up but I was able to tolerate it.  Yesterday I woke up with severe constant chills but my temperature was normal.  I felt very hungry and diaphoretic and felt like I had a low blood sugar,  and ate a bowl of rice chex cereal. I felt a little better but a half hour later VOMITED everything up.  I then felt somewhat better and went to the hospital to make rounds.  The nursing staff reported that about half of them called in sick due to the vaccine with severe fatigue, fever, joint pains and headaches.  One nurse reported that all her joints felt like they were on fire.  Four nursing supervisors also called in sick that day.   I then went to my office and my staff said I looked GREEN and insisted I go home.  I did not eat anything but while resting I again had SEVERE VOMITING of my breakfast at about noon.  When I felt stronger I drove home at about 1:30 PM and fell asleep until about 5 PM, still not having eaten anything nor taking fluids. My arm pain went away.  By 7 PM I finally drank some tea and felt stronger and felt like I was not going to die.   It seems that those of use who had the Covid in the past do not tolerate the vaccine and suffer severe reactions. I was unable to find any studies with the vaccine given to patients who already have antibodies.  This lack of data is a real problem.

There was increase in local temp with severe pruritis and induration. The rash gradually spread and later diminished in size.  There is still erythema and occasional pruritis and a small area of induration which is tender on palpation approximately 3 finger widths proximal to my elbow on the lateral left arm. No other systemic manifestations are noted.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  I received a Moderna covid-19 vaccination (Lot # 007M20A)  at 10:20 AM on Monday 02-01-2021 at the VA Clinic .  Between 3 and 4 minutes later I began to experience difficulty breathing, sweating and feeling warm, and then I passed out behind the steering wheel of my parked car, while sitting with my wife.  I came to after few minutes as people were attempting to get me out of my car and into a wheelchair, but I had difficulty breathing, couldn?t move, and had to be pulled out.  After being put in the wheelchair, I passed out again and came to after I had been taken out of the wheelchair and laid on my left side on the ground by Fire Dept. EMT?s.  I then began to retch, but did not vomit.   My wife said that one of the EMT?s pumped my chest a couple of times. They lifted me onto a gurney and put me in an ambulance, hit me with an EPI pen, and placed an oxygen mask on my face, as I was having great difficulty breathing.  I was unable to move or lift my arms to help them place a blood pressure cuff on my arm, a pulse monitor on my finger, and lift my shirt to help them attach EKG pads. Atthat point I realized that I had also lost control of my bladder at some point. I continued to have difficulty breathing, and started to experience extreme shivering all the while to emergency Room. Once in the Emergency Room, I could not move myself off the FD gurney, and they had to lift the sheet that I was laying on in order to move me onto the hospital gurney. I had great difficulty helping the technicians remove my shirt so that they could administer another EKG and start an IV (LR 1,000ml bolus).   I continued to have difficulty breathing and kept shivering and sweating for some time.  I was advised that the EKG?s both appeared normal.  After a lengthy period of I gradually reached a point where I stopped shivering and sweating, and returned to almost normal breathing.  I was finally released around 1-1:30 PM.

                                                After receiving the vaccination her husband met with his son.  He reported that his dad did not know anything.  His wife told the son to bring him to Hospital.  They brought him to the hospital and got there and his son said that he had called the daughter and he did not know the day, month, his grandson&#39;s name, like he wasn&#39;t there.  He had a funny look on his face that he was &#34;out of it&#34;.  Asked simple questions about pet at home, favorite and could not remember the name of the cat.  He then came out and said that he was fine. They ran tests for a mini-stroke, CT scan, blood work.  They had a consult with Neurology, virtual.  The neurologist did some questioning, and by 3:00 they felt that it was like a mini-stroke, and she said that she felt it was from the vaccination as it occurred right after the vaccine.  She took him home, and told him to take a nap.  By 4:30 PM she woke him up and said that they were going to eat, she was getting things ready.  He was sitting on the couch about 5:00 PM and had that blank stare again.  He went walking through the house walking aimlessly and started fumbling through papers .  She called 9-1-1 and within 10 minutes they took him to the ER.  It took her an hour to get to the hospital, his daughter met them at the ER.  He told them that he was fine, and they knew that he was not.  By 7:00 PM they were going to do an MRI and wanted to admit him to the hospital.  All of a sudden at 9:00 he was having another episode.  She got the nurse and they watched him and decided that he was having a seizure, (agitation, not making sense.).  The entire episode lasts for about 30 minutes.  They did an MRI and an EEG, which she does not have the results of.   On 2/11/21 she talked to the neurologist who insisted it was due to the vaccine.  He has now settled down and has not had another seizure since 9:00 PM the night before.   He was discharged yesterday at around 1:00 PM, he slept, got up and is fine this morning.  He was diagnosed with seizures, and to FU with Dr. in Epilepsy clinic, and prescribed Keppra, which he has not taken as he feels it was due to the vaccination..   He does not remember the events that took place.

Soreness in arm not mediated by pain meds, including Tramadol 50 MG that I take for back problems. Injection site was never red nor swollen. Trouble lifting arm without pain. Limited mobility without pain. On scale of 1 to 10 with ten being worst, pain varies between 3 and 7 at times.  Also have developed partially uncontrolled high blood pressure not mediated by heart meds, chiefly losartan. Before first vaccine, I was taking 50 mg daily. Increased to 100 mg daily on 2/1/2021 without stabalizing BP. BP can range during day from 106/60 to 158/86 with Pulse in 60s.

                                                Seizures; Mini stroke; Tired; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 73-year-old male who received Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced seizures, mini stroke, confused, agitated, eyes were abnormal, memory impairment, and tired.   The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack and stent placement in 2011. His relevant concomitant medications include acetylsalicylic acid, candesartan cilexetil, clopidogrel bisulfate, diltiazem hydrochloride, ezetimibe, adenosine, gabapentin, metoprolol tartrate and rosuvastatin calcium.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on 14 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, 30 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot#010M20A) intramuscularly in left deltoid for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Feb 2021, With in 30 minutes of receiving the vaccination, the patient had a seizure. They took him to the hospital, where he had a computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood work and had a consult. After consult, they said, it&#39;s a mini stroke. They released him and told her if it happens again call 911. He felt so tired and went to sleep at home. Around 17:00 dinner time, he woke up looked very blankly, and his wife reported knowing he had another seizure. She reported he ran to his keys saying, &#34;I have to go&#34;, seemed confused, agitated and didn&#39;t know where he was. She called 911 andhe was transported to the hospital in an ambulance.  Around 19:00 the same day, he was admitted to do scans overnight. Around 21:00, patient&#39;s eyes were abnormal, he became agitated again and nurses confirmed he was having another seizure. 30 minutes later, he was talking to his wife and daughter as if he didn&#39;t remember anything. He mentioned some metallic taste in his mouth.  On 11 Feb 2021, they did an electroencephalogram (EEG) and confirmed that he was having seizure. He was prescribed seizure medication and released him from hospital. However, the patient and his wife reported not wanting him to take the medication as they believe the events were due to the vaccine. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with vaccine is not applicable as the patient received both the doses.

                                                Chief Complaint   Pt here for muscle pain/stiffness. Pt stated, &#39;About 1d after my COVID shot, I started feeling bad. Neck pain that goes down my arm (R), extreme fatigue and achy. I&#39;ve lost 5lbs in 3d.&#39; MEDS UTD  History of Present Illness     &#34;I had that COVID shot Thursday (l arm).  Friday I started having cramps in my neck--base of my skull, R arm, into the base of my jaw.&#34;  Worse with laying down, sleeping on L side.  &#34;Hurt too much to get up&#34; (had wife help him up to bathroom).    Tried?  Bayer back and body only.  Tried some topical ben gay (made worse), vibration therapy.  Hot shower seemed to help.  Review of Systems     &#43; for chills, HA, diarrhea.  Worst yesterday.  Missed work yesterday.  Had been eating/drinking well until recently.    Assessment/Plan      1. Adverse reaction to vaccine T50.Z95A    2. Myalgia after COVID-19 vaccination M79.10     1.  Adverse vaccine response will be reported.  This seems to be fairly significant due to being 5d after.  2.  Will try Tyl 1000mg up to tid and Ibu 400 up to tid-qid for next 3 days--try to get dose of each at hs tonight.  Push fluids.  Prednisone 20mg/d x 5d.  Call report tomorrow on status.  3.  At this time, will likely avoid 2nd Moderna covid vax in this pt due to reaction.  4.  Note provided for off work yesterday through tomorrow.

Then on March 1st around 7:00 pm my arm at the injection site starting itching really bad.  Looked at arm and it was very red and very swollen at the injection site.  The red/rash, swelling and extreme itching remained all night, the 2nd day and I woke up today, Wed. March 3rd and everything is fine.  My wife looked this up online and it appears that it&#39;s a delayed reaction to the Moderna vaccine called &#34;Covid Vaccine Arm&#34; and the article said to report this.  i

After getting up also had pain in right palm just below base of thumb.  The pain seemed more like nerve pain.  Pain is not continuous, but just comes on suddenly whether I am moving arm or not.  The pain has lasted all day.  I have taken two ibuprofen tablets so far today.

                                                History of Present Illness  The patient presents with weakness.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is generalized.  The degree at present is moderate.  Associated symptoms: abdominal pain.  73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. PT states that he was feeling well until after he went to bed tonight. around 1 am he attempted to get up and go to the bathroom and his wife had to help him. She was able to get him up and he went to the bathroom but he seemed more shakey than usual. He then tried to get back up around 230 am and he was very shakey, said he was cold, and he could tno stand. She attempted to stand him up and she was not able to get him up and move him at all because he was so generally weak. No fevers that he knows of. He did recieve his first dose of the covid vaccine this afternoon. He was well after that and went to dinner and was well until he went to sleep. He has a h/o HTN, HLD, and tremor. Pt did have covid in early december as well. .    Notes: 73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. Pt is alert and awake but slower to respond than his usual per his wife. Labs are overall reassuring. His etemp is elevated but afebrile. CXR with possible atelectasis vs infiltrate but pt has no cough, no fever, and a normal WBC Coutn so I favor atelectasis. His CT head shows possibly artifact vs cortical hypodensities. Will await formal read this morning. Pts UA is clean. He is no longer shaking after a dose of tylenol and ativan. I suspect the pts generalzied weakess is 2/2 his recent covid vaccine yesterday afternoon. Despite this the pt cannot stand and move around on his own and his wife cannot care fo rhim at home given his current situation. Pt discussed with Dr and will be admitted for further care. .

                                                Immediate recurrence of GBS post vaccination.  This time around on Tuesday pt got a COVID vaccine and 6 hours after pt started feeling nauseous and 3 days after the vaccine had numbness in his feet b/l at first. Numbness travelled upwards up to the knees. Next the weakness started extending upwards to his mid thigh. Pt will not put any weight on his legs because he knows he is very unsteady.  Today he has numbness in his hands b/l. Pt had no symptoms before Tuesday. He lives at home (independent senior facility) and is coming from there. Pt woke up this morning and went from his bed to his chair and since then pt was not able to get up from the chair.

I also quivered lightly for about 30 minutes. The painful burning and discoloration began fading at two hours and was mostly gone by the third hour. #3 On March 9 at 11:20 AM the same event reoccurred, exactly as the previous day. #4 On March 14 at 8:30 AM I had the third attack, which was similar to the first two. #5 I would not call this a rash. It did not itch. There was a burning, buzzing feeling. I did not touch my skin. I called many phone numbers to see if I should take a Benadryl tablet, but none of the numbers we knew or were given provided any medical expertise. #6 We have photographs on these events.

                                                Patient started feeling woozy, dizzy, slurring words and fatigued around 11:30am. By the afternoon he was extremely fatigued and barely ate lunch or dinner. He went to bed at 9:30pm. By 1:30am, he woke up and urinated the bed because he couldn&#39;t get his urinal in place. He was extremely weak and shaking, and could barely hold his body upright when I used the lift to get him out of bed. He was not making coherent sense when he spoke, though his words and sentences were sensical, it made no sense in context.  We sent him to the ER on recommendation of the advice nurse and 4:30am. He was checked in and showed low levels of sodium and potassium. They gave him an IV and he began to feel better very soon, though he remained weak and woozy and nauseous.  He returned home in early afternoon, but remained weak for over 2 weeks afterward, slurring words and having trouble lifting his arms, though mental  function returned by that same day. The doctors believe that he had a TIA, though no evidence of a clot showed up. They did discover that he has atrial fibrillation, though they had never detected that before on the heart exams following his heart attack.

                                                Patient woke up around 3:30am feeling extremely nauseous, shaking, drenched in sweat but with a normal temperature (97.6, which is normal for him), and feeling overall terrible.  Food had tasted weird to him the day before, but he still ate. At 3:30am, he felt like he was having a major allergy attack - lots of phlegm, runny nose and eyes. He spit up a lot of thick phlegm (which can be normal for him, due to IBM). After 15 mins, the sweat and shaking died down, and he felt better enough to think about going to sleep. But 5 minutes later, the nausea returned, and he threw up about 25 mL of black &#34;coffee grounds-like&#34; fluid. (The smell was HORRIBLE). After getting through with that (about 15 minutes), he wretched up more thick mucus with a few flecks of black cells in it. After awhile, he felt okay enough to go back to sleep.  Around 6am, he had another major allergy-like attack, but did not vomit.  Around 8am, after being awake for awhile, he vomited again with more black liquid, about 50mL this time. He felt weak and horrible and was shaking. At the recommendation of the advice nurse, he was taken to the ER by ambulance. Upon arriving, he waited around an hour for an ER bed.  They put him on an IV, did a physical inspection and did blood work. His sodium was a bit low, but in normal range. Potassium levels were fine. He was mentally clear the whole time, but physically very weak.  He was kept overnight after a hemochrit test in the afternoon showed low levels of hemoglobin. He was stabilized in the morning, but was barely able to eat anything the whole time. He was meant to get an endoscopy, but they decided to allow him to eat and sent him home after noon bc they hadn&#39;t yet been able to schedule him for it and he was in pain and massively hungry.  When he got home, he still barely ate,  and still isn&#39;t eating almost anything a day later. His stool was incredibly black and thick and SMELLY immediately upon arriving home (he had not defecated for 48 hours at that point), and he has not been able to defecate since, which is extremely abnormal (he usually goes each day in the morning upon waking).  They believe that he may have bleeding in his stomach or upper GI or esophagus, but we are waiting for an endoscopy later this week.  He is still very weak and frail and fatigued.

At some point during the night he wound up on the floor and eventually yelled for help. He was unable to get up by himself and was down there for an unknown amount of time. His spouse believes a few hours. He then continued the same symptoms and wife gave him crackers, sprite and fluids. He slept Saturday night in his recliner, He was still unwell Sunday morning so she called an ambulance who took him to ER. He was then sent to another hospital.  Initially thought he had kidney and liver failure as well as heart attack but she states the muscle damage is what cause the labs to look similar to a heart attack and his kidneys and liver were trying to expel toxins/waste from muscle damage and he was very dehydrated. His liver and kidneys recovered  in about 2 or 3 days and he received IVF and  spent 7 days at the hospital and is still in Rehab recovering.

About 10 days after second dose hallucinations (?); 5:00 am got up, dressed, and walked downstairs asking if I had called the police, because he said I had told him to get up and come downstairs so I could call them.  There were not problems needing the police.  We took it as a very real dream and he went back to bed.  Over the next few weeks, he experienced weakness and dizziness/vertigo  causing three falls.  Went to primary care physician who prescribed Antivert and is sending him for a CAT scan and to a neurologist for further evaluation (vestibuar neuritis?  labyrinthitis?).

Stayed in the pharmacy for about 45 minutes. Felt the breathing difficulty going away so decided to drive home. The breathing difficulty came back when I reached home (a 5-minute drive).  Feel asleep; woke up after about an hour and the breathing difficulty is completely gone. Have not felt it again until this report date (1/22/21 1:16am).

On Monday 1/25 both legs were much better and both finally cleared up on 1/27.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. On the morning of 02/17 at 04:20 I woke up with chills and muscle cramps that felt just like the flu. One additional symptom was muscle spasms in my upper back between the shoulder blades. This experience I had never had before. Now that it has been 7 days after the vaccine; all the after effects were gone after the second day. All is well. Thank you.

Several hours later I noticed that I had flu like symptons and my bones seemed to be painful.  Eventually I began having intermittent rapid heart beat.  I thought this may have been induced by tea (caffeine).  This rapid heart beat lasted until Monday (Feb. 15) I think.  As I mentioned it was intermittent.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

                                                Day after the 2nd shot at about 0930 got extreme shivers while taking a hot shower. By mid-afternoon had  a fever of 100-101. Flushed &amp; shivery. Thereafter I have no recollection of the rest of the day till about 10:15 pm when my wife took me to bed. During the afternoon I called my sister &amp; sent her a garbled text. I tried to talk to my wife but couldn&#39;t get the words out &amp; didn&#39;t know  how to ask for what I wanted. I had a dazed look.  I have absolutely NO recollection of any of this. slept well that night. The next day Feb 27th I woke feeling largely improved, not feverish &amp; still a bit heavy headed. But I was quite clumsy most of the day, dropping small items &amp; bumping into things.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  The patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown) on unknown date. On 29-Jan-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 029K20A) for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.   The patient stated that at some point after receiving the second vaccine, he began experiencing neuropathy that affected his balance and caused tingling.    Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, neuropathy that is affecting his balance and tingling, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Additional Details: Pt reported being lightheaded and wanted to lie down. Tried to assist him to our breakroom so he could lie down in private, but he lost strength and slowly went down. 2 pharmacists were on either side of him and gently laid him to the ground. He was alert and responsive but extremely bradycardic. The ambulance came and took him away.

Went to ER on 2/16 and was attended a neurologist. He believed that the dx was likely &#34;recrudescence stroke&#34; was the symptoms were very similar to the previously noted stroke from 2016. All testing (CAT scan, EEG, MRI, MRA, echo cardiogram, and blood work was all normal/negative).  I&#39;ve been a licensed physical therapist for over 50 years but had never heard of a recrudescence stroke.  After reading about the signs, and symptoms I believe it was exactly what happened and was correct when he called it a recrudescence stroke

                                                I received the first Moderna injection on Feb. 4 and the second on March 10 both in 2021.  My side effects from both injections were identical.  Left arm (site of both injections) was minorly sore.  Headache, body ache and feverish sensation were severe and comparable to having Type A influenza and seemed to last around 35 hours.  I had to resort to taking the maximum dosage of Tylenol to somewhat suppress the side effects.  I am feeling slightly better from yesterday&#39;s injection and expect to be back to normal tomorrow.

                                                Saturday, Marth 5th -- day after vaccination.  Upon awakening, extreme pain head-to-toe, in muscles and joints.  Severe headache (very rare for me), Hands could barely move (like severe arthritis),  Slightly elevated temperature (98.9 when my normal is 97.8).  Overall symptoms faded slightly and then returned to full strength two or three times during the day.  Unable to eat (not nauseous, just not hungry) and only drank water.  No bowel movement and very little urination during the day.  By about 18:00, headache was gone and pain was receding .  Around 21:00 started getting very cold and could not seem to get warm.  Started shaking severely from cold.  Put on sweat suit, turned on bed heater, and added blankets, then went to bed around 22:00.    Woke up Sunday morning (March 7th feeling absolutely perfect!  None of the previous day&#39;s pain was present, no temperature, no limits to hand/finger movement, and was very hungry.  Ate a normal size breakfast with no problems, urination was normal,   It was like the reaction had never happened, but my wife assured me that it had.   Other than slight constipation, I have no had any problems since.

He notes that walks everyday but noticed that for the first time his legs began to give out even when he was walking short distances within his house about 6 days ago. 2 days ago he was unable to walk short distance in his house at all and began to use a rolling chair. At that time he was still able to transfer from chair to the toilet seat. On the day of presentation he started to use a wheelchair around the house (unclear where ti was obtained, no assistance at baseline). He no longer is able to transfer himself from the chair to the bed or toilet seat. Feels that his hands are beginning to feel weak as well. He cannot tell if he is at the peak of his weakness yet. Denies difficulty with swallowing, breathing or speech. No shooting pains down his legs, no change in sensation in saddle area, no loss of control of bowel or urinary movements.

                                                I got out of bed at my normal time of 5 AM and proceeded to the bathroom to urinate, feeling fine. Just before starting to urinate, I started sweating profusely and shaking and so turned around and sat down on the toilet. I then sweat even more as if I was in the shower, and shook violently. I then started feeling very nauseous, but I was shaking so badly that I had to very carefully  hold the toilet  to turn around to kneel down in front of the toilet. I heaved a number of times, but nothing came up. I finally stopped shaking and sat on the floor in front of the toilet for a while, and the sweating got less. After a short time, I got up and walked slowly to a recliner, about 30&#39; away. The nausea had gone away by then and the sweating had subsided. My wife brought me blanket and I rested till 7:30 AM.  I had a cup of coffee about 8 AM, and a bowel of cereal at 9 AM. I have been fine ever since then, no more reactions, thank goodness. That one was horrible.

At the suggestion of my doctor I saw a chiropractor.  I received acupuncture which helped some what.  About one week after the second inoculation the back pain became the same as one month previously including for the first time pain in my neck, right hip and right leg.  I do not have arthritis.  I have an appointment on March 29 to see my doctor who hopefully will provide advice on how to treat this pain.

Clearly a systemic reaction to the vaccine.  The bursitis in my right shoulder precipitated a cascade of adverse effects that became quite debilitating, and from which I am still recovering. The bursitis in my right knew made squatting difficult for about a week, but that symptom is substantially gone.  Here is the sequence in more detail: Vaccinated (Moderna) on Feb 4; went to play tennis on Feb 10; had discomfort raising my right arm (racquet arm)  when hitting my topspin backhand which has a high follow through ; decided to instead practice slice backhand. Developed acute pain next pain. Could not raise my arm ab ove shoulder for weeks now.

Due to the remoteness of where the individual lives and his lack of housemate, it is unknown how long he had been dead, but it is not believe that he was dead for more than 1-2 days. He had no adverse reactions in the 15-30 minutes that he was observed post-injection. He also reported only a sore arm to the public health nurse in an email a few days after his vaccination.

                                                Patient received first COVID vaccine on 2/6/2021 and second vaccine on 3/6/2021. Patient presented to Hospital on 4/09/2021 for persistent nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria and jaundice. Patient reported a 1 month history of intermittent nausea and vomiting, generalized abdominal pain, feeling dizzy and weak, poor appetite. Patient had a colonoscopy ~2 weeks prior admission to hospital for cancer screening purposes which was unremarkable and labs done by his primary care at that time were all normal (per admitting physician&#39;s note). At hospital, patient was found to have evidence of hemolytic anemia thought to be autoimmune in nature with a positive direct antiglobulin. Patient was subsequently transferred to hospital on 4/11/2021 for further workup. Patient is still currently admitted to hospital. Oncology was consulted for workup of pancytopenia and suspected warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Throughout admission, the patient&#39;s platelets have ranged between 59-154 k/µL and hemoglobin has ranged 4.5-8.6 g/dL with no documented history of thrombocytopenia or anemia. Patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg x9 doses, prednisone 80 mg daily (1 mg/kg) x5 doses, prednisone 60 mg x1 dose, rituximab 740 mg (375 mg/m2)  x3 doses, and immune globulin 40 g x3 doses. Patient has also received 4 units of packed red blood cells. Given the timing of anemia and thrombocytopenia and unknown etiology, immune response to his COVID vaccine is on the differential.

At the time of death, PNEUMONIA (pneumonia), UNEVALUABLE EVENT (Unevaluable event), ASTHENIA (Asthenia), DIARRHOEA (Diarrhoea), THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT EFFECT INCOMPLETE (Therapeutic product effect incomplete), DRUG INEFFECTIVE (Drug ineffective), RIGHT ATRIAL DILATATION (Right atrial dilatation), AORTIC VALVE SCLEROSIS (Aortic valve sclerosis), CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (Coronary artery disease), MALAISE (Malaise), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Muscular weakness), FATIGUE (Fatigue), NAUSEA (Nausea), HEADACHE (Headache) and VOMITING (Vomiting) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 03-Jul-2018, Pulmonary arterial pressure: pulmonary arterial pressure elevated (High) Pulmonary arterial pressure elevated. In 2021, Angiogram: no evidence for central pulmonary embolus. (Inconclusive) No evidence for central pulmonary embolus. Slight interval decrease in the patient&#39;s 2 previously identified right sided pulmonary nodules. Slight decrease in the one measurable mediastinal lymph node. The patient&#39;s other lymphadenopathy is probably also improved but difficult to measure due to the technique. Worsening airspace disease in a somewhat interstitial pattern. Pulmonary edema would be the first consideration. Infection would be the second consideration. Severe centrilobar and paraseptal emphysema with basilar predominately peripheral reticular opacities consistent with fibrotic lung disease.. In 2021, Chest X-ray: no infiltrate (Inconclusive) no infiltrate. In 2021, Echocardiogram: severe right atrial ventricular dilatation with... (abnormal) Severe right atrial ventricular dilatation with reduced RV systolic function (&#34;D&#34; sign). Small and under-filled left ventricle with hyperdynamic systolic function, estimated LVEF is 75%. Minimal aortic valve sclerosis with no stenosis. Moderate mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. Estimated PA systolic pressure is severely elevated (68.6 mmHg). Compared to the prior report dated 7/3/2018; there is a worsening right heart dilatation and function. There is increased mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. No significant change in estimated PA pressure.. In 2021, Heart rate: abnormal (abnormal) abnormal. In 2021, Pulmonary arterial pressure: 68.6 mmhg (High) Severely elevated. In 2021, Ultrasound scan: no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the... (Inconclusive) No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower extremities. In 2021, White blood cell count: no leukocytosis (Inconclusive) No leukocytosis.         Concomitant medications included unknown statins. On 02-0CT-2020, Co- suspect drug chemotherapy  is given to the patient to treat small cell lung  cancer metastatic, Metastases to liver and Metastases to lymph nodes.  On an unspecified date(s) in 2021, the patient had radiation of his head and lung for his cancer. Initially  on 18-SEP-2020,the patient started with 10mg of firdapse , On 02-OCT-2020, the dose  increased to 20mg. On 22-SEP-2020, while in the hospital the patient experienced blood pressure fluctuations. the patient experienced a headache that was &#34;4/10.Treatment medications included acetaminophen; aspirin; caffeine and ibuprofen for headache, treated with prednisone 60mg and methyl prednisolone for immune mediated pneumonitis,On an unspecified date, the patient was treated with midodrine, patient was cautiously diuresed with IV furosemide bolus dosing followed by gtt (drip) given &#34;soft pressures. the patient was treated with low dose diltiazem For paroxysmal a-fib (atrial fibrillation) and MAT (medication-assisted treatment). patient was initially given amiodarone 400mg daily x 7 days for blood pressure, then the dose reduced to 200mg, On an unspecified date, patient was treated with  low dose metoprolol (12.5 mg), patient was treated with Xarelto (rivaroxaban) 15 mg daily for stroke risk reduction.On an unspecified date, the patient&#39;s diuretic (presumed IV Lasix drip) was transitioned to torsemide 5 mg, orally daily.patient  received atovaquone for PJP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) prophylaxis and treated with empiric antibiotics for CAP (community acquired pneumonia). On unspecified date, steroid regimen was increased.On an unspecified date, the patient&#39;s respiratory symptoms improved and was weaned to 2 liters of oxygen. While hospitalized, the patient received non drug treatment like PT (physical therapy) and OT (occupational therapy), the patient was treated with supplemental O2 (oxygen) and  IVF (intravenous fluids).

                                                I just wanted to report what appears to be a minor delayed reaction to the Moderna vaccine. I received my first dose on Monday 1/18. I had only a sore arm and a minor headache for a day or two afterward. However, this Monday (day 7) I had what felt like a mosquito bite at or near the injection site and it itched quite badly that night. Yesterday (day 8) I didn?t notice much, but last night it started to itch again and I noticed that it had developed into more of a rash around the injection site (nowhere else). It was pink and somewhat warm. I put ice on it and took a Tylenol and it was much improved and it hasn?t bothered me much since then. It is calmer today, but still pink.  I am not really concerned about this, but I thought I should let you know just in case there is something else I should know or do. I plan to go ahead with my second dose which is scheduled for 2/15.

                                                Approximately 20 hours after the injection I began to suffer from flu-like symptoms; headache, fever, chills, aches, and extreme weakness. I was also very tired and spent the afternoon through the night in bed. I had heavy covers but needed a sweatshirt with a hood up to stay warm.  I am not sure when I went to sleep, but when I awoke the next morning most of the symptoms were gone.   Except for being somewhat tired, I felt fine.  I was completely recovered by about noon, so I would estimate that my symptoms were less than 24 hours in duration; no recurrences to date.

The patient did not tell me this was his second dose. Somehow, he had an appointment to receive the vaccine on 02/9/21. I did not know that he had gotten the first dose on 01/21/21. I missed the information on the consent form and administered the vaccine 19 days after the first dose (9 days earlier than the recommended 28 days). Patient did not have any significant adverse reactions other than sore arm, chills, and body aches (which are common with the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine). The patient received the vaccine earlier than recommended by guidelines.  Patient came in today because they received a call that their appointment had been cancelled due to shortage of vaccine. Patient&#39;s wife comes in confused since the patient had already received both doses. I apologized to the patient&#39;s wife, asked if he had any serious reaction and the wife said, &#34;no significant reactions&#34;.  Advised patient that I would report this mistake.

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.

                                                Patient was at clinic to receive his 2nd dose of the Moderna CoVID-19 Vaccine.  Approx 13 minutes after receiving the dose, patient became weak, dizzy, and extremely diaphoretic.  Rapid response was called.  Patient was wheeled into exam room.  BG checked immediately and was 110.  Initial vitals showed HR 39 with BP 83/48.  Patient was transferred to exam table w/o incident.  He did not complain of CP or SOB.  Denies any throat swelling or itching.  He felt very weak and tired.  He continued to be extremely diaphoretic.  An 18G IV was introduced to the left forearm without incident.  He was connected to 1 L bag of 0.9% Normal Saline which was hung to bolus, running well without pressure.  EKG obtained and showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 43.  Possible ST changes in V1 and V2, but not diagnostic of ST elevations or depressions.  There is IVCD noted.  Patient has hx of AFib - not in Afib currently.  Reports on Eliquis instead of Coumadin.  EMS was contacted.    Physical exam performed revealed a bradycardic HR which was regular. No murmurs.  Lungs are clear.  Patient is extremely diaphoretic and pale.  He is alert and oriented x 3.  He is not in respiratory distress and shows no signs of oral swelling. No hives noted on his skin.  Vitals were rechecked at 3 mins and showed SaO2 at 95% and then 92%.  NC O2 applied at 2 L/min continuous and there was improvement to 95%.  He still denies any respiratory distress and was not manifesting any signs of respiratory distress.  Still denied any chest pain.  NS continued to infuse at bolus dose and BP recheck improved to 108/65 - patient was lying supine.  HR remained between 40-42.  At this time, the patient reported improved symptoms and he was not sweating as profusely as previously.  At this time EMS arrived.  Atropine was not administered in the clinic, but was prepared in expectation as a possible next step.  As patient&#39;s symptoms improved, but his vital signs remained altered, he was agreeable to transport to the hospital by EMS.  He was placed on stretcher and care was relinquished to EMS team.  Patient transported out of clinic in guarded condition.

                                                Vaccination at 9:00am. Some discomfort but not real pain in upper arm throughout the day, but became really tired later in the day and went to bed early. Got up to use the bathroom at about 11:30pm.  Swung my legs out of bed to the floor and went to stand up but fell forward to the carpet.  I had no strength in my legs or arms.  I laid on the floor about 10 minutes and could not roll over or sit up or get up to my knees.  My wife came around and helped me get up and back on the bed.  She then helped me down the hall to the bathroom, then back to the bedroom.  She helped me back to the bathroom one other time that night.  I stayed in bed for several hours and was very week and mostly sat all day,  I regained my strength over the next three days to where I could stand and walk, although I was very fatigued.  I am now about 9 days later and feel pretty much normal but get fatigued and my balance is not normal.

                                                Injection was given into the deltoid at an almost vertical angle.  After about two hours, and lasting five days, the left arm was extremely sore to the point that assistance was needed to don and remove clothing.  This is considered adverse as compared to the initial injection into the left bicep which resulted in absolutely no side effects.  I believe the location of the second shot drastically effected the outcome.

My watch also indicated that my heart rate was 122 while playing golf.  My temperature was 100.5.  After a couple of hours resting my heart rate went down to 75 and temperature lowered to 99.  I felt fine the following morning but my vaccination site turned bright pink and started itching.  This continued for 2 days.  I have had no issues since Friday, March 5th.

                                                Possible Stroke; Unable to speak/Lack of pronunciations; Fatigue; A spontaneous report was received from a health care professional concerning 75-years old male patient who experienced stroke (Cerebrovascular accident), unable to speak/ lack of pronunciations (Speech disorder) and fatigue (Fatigue).  The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack. Concomitant medications included included Metoprolol, HCTZ, Irbesartan, and Aspirin.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 012L201A) intramuscularly in the Anatomical location for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 05 Feb 2021, approximately four days prior to the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 030L20A) intramuscularly in the Anatomical location for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Feb 2021, the patient experienced fatigue.  On 09 Feb 2021, the patient experienced the events stroke and unable to speak/ lack of pronunciations. The events resulted in hospitalisation as seriousness criteria. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 09 Feb 2021. The patient was moved to ICU for 24 hours, and was the patient was discharged from Hospital on 11 Feb 2021. Treatment for the event included Eliquis and 80 mg chewable aspirin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events stroke, unable to speak/ lack of pronunciations and fatigue were considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, a temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Of note, the patient has a pre-existing history of heart attack which is a strong confounder for the reported CVA and speech disorder. Fatigue is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

                                                I started having severe balance issues on the 10th and rapidly &#34;progressed&#34; to extreme weakness. I could not walk 50 feet to my parked truck without assistance and even that took me about 30 minutes. After getting home I collapsed on the garage floor and it took me 30 minutes to crawl into the house and finally get seated into a chair with the assistance of my wife. The next morning (3/11) I could walk around the house a bit (without walking stick or walker for help) but I am still a bit weaker (than normal). I have had Parkinsons for about two years but I have never had such an instance of weakness or profound immobility. I have not seen my doctor yet and will wait a while to see if conditions worsen.

My pulse oximeter showed low blood oxygen (between 80 and 85%) and elevated heart rate (high 70&#39;s/low 80&#39;s).  [I took multiple readings to make sure the numbers were accurate.]  By 10 PM my temperature started to increase rapidly.  Max was around 101.5 to 102F.  Sweat profusely.  By about midnight the fever &#34;broke&#34; (dropped back to normal range).  This will sound odd, but I felt like I had been shown what a severe Covid-19 infection/disease would look like if I were to become seriously ill with the disease.  Felt light-headed on Friday (3/12/21).  [I had no reaction, other than some muscle soreness, from the first dose.The same day as and after the second injection I had soreness in my entire left bicep all day.  No other reactions that day.]

It was so strong that I initially thought I was having a heart attack. However, other symptoms associated with such an event did not occur, that is no profuse sweating, rapdid heart beat, etc. On Monday, I visted my doctor who listened to my heart and took an EKG. The EKG was normal and she felt that the spasm was associated with the Moderna shot.  I have had no further such events

The symptoms became severe enough that he had trouble standing, walking and, ultimately, suffered a fall.  Normally, the subject is able to maintain all functions of independent daily living, exercises regularly and is able to walk more than 5 miles.  These symptoms were also present in similar severity, within a similar time frame after receiving Moderna #1 vaccination. The subject had received a positive test for Covid 19 in late November, 2020 and was largely asymptomatic.

                                                Initially after the second vaccine he had typical myalgias/arthralgias, especially shoulder/neck. On 3/19 he got acutely worse with severe pain both shoulders/wrists/hands. He came to ER 3/24 with symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving shoulders/wrists/hands and edema of the hands-pitting edema on dorsum of right hand. He was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t take off his shirt without assistance, couldn&#39;t bend the wrists, couldn&#39;t make a fist.   Clinically, this looked like RSP3PE and resolved within 24 hours on prednisone 20 mg bid which is tapered down today.    Patient returned to the ER today 3/24 with nausea/vomiting and that is currently being worked up. If it appears that this has anything to do with the vaccine, I will file a second report with the new symptoms.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history).   On 15-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced FACIAL PARALYSIS (bell&#39;s palsy (paralyze of the left side of the face)) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, FACIAL PARALYSIS (bell&#39;s palsy (paralyze of the left side of the face)) had not resolved.      No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  The patient was treated with Valtrex (valaciclovir) and prednisone.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to events was not applicable.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported event of facial paralysis, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I spoke with wife who stated she was with the patient today, he worked outside shoveling and snow blowing with the winter storm. She saw him minutes before 4pm (she estimated 3:58p) and he was his normal self, then she walked to another room, called out to him, he didn&#39;t respond, so she ran back to where he was and saw him slumped over and weak on the L, she immediately called 911. She has record on her phone of calling a family member (daughter?) about this at 4:01, right after she had called 911, so LKN consider just before 4pm.  Patient states he takes only medications for hypertension at home. Denies being on any blood thinners and no record of blood thinners in his chart. Denies recent surgeries, denies history of ICH, denies bleeding issues in the past, denies ever having had a prior stroke.  BG 122 on arrival. BP initially 121/84 then increased requiring some labetalol.
