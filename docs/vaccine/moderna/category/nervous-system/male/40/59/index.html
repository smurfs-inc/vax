Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                At about 1330 on 30DEC, the patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Less than five minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient noticed a metallic taste.  About two to three minutes afterwards, the patient noticed a ?tingling? sensation mostly on the left side of the face and minimally on the right side.  Almost immediately after the ?tingling? sensation, the patient felt the sensation of an increased heart rate and checked his pulse with his watch that had a pulse sensor.  The watch indicated that he had a heart rate of 115 bpm.  This sensation of an increased heart rate subsided after for one or two minutes and repeat pulse measurement was in the low 90s.  Towards the end of the 15 minute post-vaccination observation period, the medical technician did the final check on the patient.  The patient admitted to experiencing a metallic taste and a mild tingling sensation on the neck and face area.  The service member was immediately brought back to the treatment room were a faint red rash and was noticed on the left side of the neck by the medical providers present.  Two doses of Benadryl 25mg were given and the patient was told to continue to be observed in the observation area.  After about 20 minutes, the tingling sensation resolved.  The patient checked his pulse again and it was in the low 70s.  The metallic taste resolved after about one and a half hours after the start of the symptom.

                                                After about 15 minutes, I began to feel lightheaded and experience a tingling in my arms/hands. I&#39;d guess it was related to the nerves in the arms, because it specifically affected my pinky and ring fingers on both hands. I was also unsteady on my feet, but did not lose consciousness. The lightheadedness and tingling continued off and on for most of the day. The tingling appeared to go away the next day, but I still experienced periodic (though rare) feelings of lightheadedness. Perhaps 2-3 time the next day (Saturday) and experienced maybe 1-2 times the following day (Sunday). I did not take Adderall on the weekend. On Monday, I did take Adderall and returned to work, where I experience some tingling again and longer bouts of lightheadedness. Again, I have not lost consciousness.

He pulled over and threw up. Once he got to work he vomited again. He drove to another facility for work and then threw up 3 or 4 more times. He began experiencing hot flashes at this time. He went to the hospital and was seen in the emergency room. He threw up several more times in the ER and stated that his heart was racing and that he had diarrhea. The emergency room gave him medications for the nausea and he stayed there for 2 or 3 hours. He began to feel better and was discharged to home.

                                                Sore shoulder started after a couple of hours and was moderate by evening. A general unusual feeling started within a couple hours of the shot.  By 7pm I started to experience chills and joint fatigue in legs (knees, toes).  Chills became severe and a low grade fever of 100.6 developed.  Chills lasted about 1.5hrs.  Fever broke overnight. By morning all previous issues were resolved and the only issue was a problem with equilibrium and balance (and sore shoulder)  It was a general feeling similar to drunkenness.  This issue persisted throughout the day and by evening I was experiencing mild vertigo when I closed my eyes. I went to bed feeling somewhat improved relative to all the symptoms but woke having experienced a cold sweat. My shirt was completely soaked. I noted several less significant sweating issues throughout this day with no other side effects. This was the final day with notable symptoms. At the time of this report I have minor shoulder pain as the only symptom that persisted throughout. The equilibrium symptoms were severe enough that I missed a day of work.

                                                Starting this morning, the left side of my face has gone numb.  There is a charlie horse like feeling in my left cheek, which is now also present in my left jaw. The left side of my tongue is numb with slight pain, and my bottom lip is numb on the left side, and the feeling stops at the middle like there were a line drawn down my face.  My upper left cheek and the side of my left eye have a constant,  moderate burning feeling.  The shot was in my left arm.  The Dr. at urgent care said it was not a stroke, so that&#39;s good.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  It has now been over 13 hours.

                                                The shot was administered in my left arm.  I experienced localized swelling and axillary lymph node tenderness immediately after injection under my left armpit.  The right side of my face also became numb for about 5 minutes.  The next morning the areas around my eyes were swollen and I had two styes in my right eye.  I do not know if these were related.  These symptoms lasted approximately 3 days.  Some minimal swelling and tenderness seemed to remain, and approximately a week later I experienced a painful resurgence of the swelling at the injection site that was far larger, harder and more painful.  I took Benadryl and Ibuprofen.  These relieved the symptoms within 48 hours.

                                                Normally sore following the vaccine starting around 9:00 PM last night.  Had shivers, nothing terrible.  By 6:00 AM the chills were intense, weakness, having less coordination and depth perception issue.  Closer to 9:00-10:00 AM felt like he had the flu 10 times worse than he should have.  Had COVID in April/May but these symptoms worse.  Got home at 11:15 AM was so cold, hands were ice cold, and took 2 hours of sleeping and all layers of clothing to feel warm.  Took a few layers off and still shaking, feverish and feeling of worse flu to man. Pain all over the body, temperature at 3:30 is 99.5-100.4, above 98 is fever is fever for him, normal is 96-97.  Sharp shooting muscle pains in extremities, top part of the hands, muscles, tendons, and also his legs and feet, but not fingers or toes.  Pain is quite intense.  All he wants to do is lay down in sleep.   Thought he was going to freeze to death.  Hands were so cold his kids were concerned.  Ice packs on chest, and gloves and 10 layers on hands and arms.  Had tremendous trouble breathing while having the intense chills.    He is a responder for law enforcement.   Symptoms have improved some, but still feeling feverish with shooting pains, depth perception issues, as well as pain.  Headache in back of head, pressure type.  Called off for work for today and tomorrow.

The symptoms got progressively worse over the next few days and on Sunday 2/28/2021 the right side of my face was completely paralyzed. I sought emergency care at Hospital Emergency Room where I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. The doctor who treated me strongly believes that the Bells Palsy was due to the Moderna vaccine. Today (9 days post vaccine) the entire right side of my face continues to be completely paralyzed with no signs of improvement.

                                                On 28-FEB-2021, at approximately 2000, I developed left facial numbness felt on top of the left forehead, left eyebrow, left nasal bridge, inside of left nose (nares), top and bottom of left lip, left side of the cheek, and left side of the tongue.  Left eye blin is weak and unable to fully close left eye.  Left ear was aggravated and irritated when scratched.  Hearing is distorted, felt as if I had been submerged in water for a prolonged amount of time.  There is ringing at times on left ear as well.  Symptoms were progressive.  Today (05-MAR-2021), also developed vertiginous sensation and light-headedness.

                                                On 4/8/21 awoke to intense pain in his left foot about 12 hours after receiving his 1st dose Moderna vaccine batch #038B21A. Over the next few days swelling and pain increased in the left foot moving around from the big toe, to ankle, to arch. His foot was swollen and extremely painful and he was not able to walk or put weight on the foot. On 4/18 he went to the clinic. The doctor took fluid from the big toe joint to test uric acid levels. Elevated levels of uric acid confirmed his condition to be Gout and Indomethacin was prescribed for pain and swelling. He has never had Gout or any kind of arthritis,  joint pain or foot injury prior to the Moderna vaccine. As of 4/13/21 he is still unable to walk or sleep well due to pain and swelling in the foot. He is not able to work or resume normal daily activities.

                                                I work at a Hospital sterilizing surgical equipment.  After I received the vaccine, the hospital staff observed me for 15 minutes to see if a reaction occurred.  I felt fine, and they told me I could go.  I was working that day (2-10:30pm) and had gotten vaccinated at the beginning of my shift.  The rest of my shift went fine.  Near the end, though, my arm began to feel sore.  Driving home, I began to feel tired.  By the time I got home, it felt like a cold was setting in.  I ate a large bowl of chicken soup to try to feel better.  I stayed up a little bit, but was feeling woozy by this point and went to bed.  Bad chills set in and I began to shake I felt so cold.  I used a heating pad to help with this.  I tried to sleep, but my head was throbbing.  The next morning, I tried to sit up in bed but my first attempt proved too difficult.  I took it slower.  I was able to sit up eventually.  Standing was also difficult.  I spent the day mostly lounging on the couch.  I slept a little better that night, but my head was still throbbing somewhat.  No chills this time.  Getting up the next morning went a little better.  I was able to sit up in bed without issue and walking around did not prove as much of a chore.

Hives at torso after 10 minutes.   I was assessed by to physicians working at the site.

After observation for 4 hours I was feeling better, and was discharged home.   Ordered to take 40mg of steroids for 2 more days.  After one day post vaccination, I have significant pain at the site and body ache.

Didn&#39;t think anything of it, Monday my right eye began to water like crazy. Didn&#39;t think anything of it. Tuesday morning I had a hard time eating breakfast because I couldn&#39;t open my mouth wide enough and was hitting my bottom lip with my teeth. i thought it was strange but didn&#39;t think anything of it. Took a shower about 11;30 and when I looked in the mirror I notice the ride side of my face was not responding like the left side, I called my doctors office and they got me right in. After a brief consultation they called ER and told me I would be on my way. I checked into ER at about 1;30pm.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

Then I rapidly spiked a 102.7 fever and became so physically weak I felt paralyzed. Oxygen saturation dropped into the low 90s and I began to have labored breathing. I made an attempt to stand up and urinate, then passed out and collapsed. Ems came to the house and checked me out. I declined their offer to go to the hospital because I broke the fever, was breathing better, and had no concussion signs from the fall.

                                                Around 11:30 pm that evening I started feeling extremely warm in my face and thighs. Figuring it was due to the shot, I decide to try and lay down to sleep it off. A short time later, I awoke freezing with chills and uncontrollable shivering. My whole body hurt especially my lower back and pressure in my head. This continued throughout the night until the early morning. As the shivering and chills subsided, extreme fatigue, body aches and head pressure continued and it was difficult to get up at points. I had no appetite and forced myself to drink to stay hydrated.  About 1:00 pm, I started to feel better, but that was short lived. Approximately 4:30 ? 5pm, the chills and shivering returned and I had 101 fever. I had some tea and toast and then went to bed for the night. When I awoke this morning, I felt a million times better. As of writing this email, I still have some slight fatigue, aches, and head pressure, but night and day difference from yesterday.

                                                Approximately 12 hours post-injection developed chills (around 10:30 pm). Went to bed and woke up with night sweats, aches, chills, fever (persistently over 100F, topped at 101.3F) and one of the worst headaches I?ve ever had (not hyperbole, truly a monster headache). Slept for small stretches of time, maybe 45-60 mins, before waking. Condition worsened until about 6-7am. Chills persisted but worst symptom was the headache, it was inescapable pain. At 9am, took 400mg ibuprofen and was able to fall asleep.  Woke again around 10:30, soaking wet in sweat, but felt much better. Headache about 95% resolved, fever subsided (temp returned to steady 98.2).  Felt generally tired the rest of the day, but overall much better than the overnight period.

When I woke up at 5 Am I suffered from severe headache. Remainder of the day I had extreme digestive issues that continued over the next several days. At the conclusion of the second day I developed a fever of 101. Pinpointed severe pain developed at the base of my neck between my shoulder blades. That pain remained for approximately 24 to 48 hours that lead to extreme pain and stiff neck on my right side. Chills and periodic fever developed for two days past shot. By day three I had extreme right side neck pain that continued down into my right shoulder blade. By day four and five I suffered from extreme neck pain and severe headache that was focused from my right eye through my head down the right side of my neck to my right shoulder blade. By day 4 this continued with dizziness and blurred vision. I had inability to eat and strong feelings to vomit but only didn&#39;t because I hadn&#39;t consumed any food that day. I continued to suffer from extreme headaches and complete physical exhaustion with inability to stay away. In addition, I continued to have periodic chills but with no fever.  As I submit this in day 5 I still suffer from lack of energy and the stiff neck remains down through my right shoulder blade.

                                                Went to ED 3/30/21  Immediately after receiving the second vaccine 2/25 he developed chest tightness and joint pain. The chest tightness resolved within a few hours. He then had severe fatigue x36 hours-sleeping most of that time?followed by fever, chills, myalgias x2d. Those resolved but the arthralgias have persisted since then. Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain. The sacral sxs resolved w/in 1 week but the tingling in extremities has persisted.

No treatment was needed.    On January 1st I noticed tingling  in both of my legs.   Since then it has gotten worse.  I have tingling in both legs, muscle twitching throughout both legs intermittently, muscle weakness specifically after muscle use, an abnormal skin sensitivity when wearing pants, and a consistent ache throughout my legs.  The symptoms affect me 24 hours a day and create an anxiety that I have not felt before.  It has also adversely affected my sleep.

I woke up the morning after the vaccine with a fever, chills, muscle aches and my injection site in pain.  After one day I felt better, but my arm still hurt.  I hurt for 4 days and spread down my arm and into my ribs.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

The symptoms sided over the last 12 hours of the 36 hours mentioned. A very light state of feeling tired persisted another 24 hrs as well as a slightly elevated temperature (1-1.5 degrees). I was positive for  Covid in March of 2019 for a total of 6 weeks. The first two weeks were the most intense. This felt like a scaled down version of those two weeks. I never required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in March.

My best estimate as the fast heartbeat last for between 60-120 seconds. I experienced the tingling feeling one more time, about 15 minutes later.

                                                Day after the vaccine I awoke with a very sore left arm which was to be expected.  Upon moving I experienced vertigo, dizziness, headache, and extreme pressure in the left side of my face to include sinus cavities and deep inner ear pressure.  I had some episodes of loose stools, not diarrhea, but not formed stools.  These symptoms still persist to today, 1/15/2021, except for loose stool, that has returned to normal.  I had a Dr. appointment today and the doctor would not rule out post vaccine side effects. I was tested for COVID on 1/11/2021 as a precautionary measure as I was displaying symptoms, but the test result was COVID not detected.

The following two days my arm was sore at the injection site but that went away in a couple days.  3 days post vaccination, my right axilla and median and ulnar nerves were extremely sensitive for 3 days but that subsided.  6 days post vaccine I started to get extreme fatigued, low energy and feel like my nerves were hot.  I got a covid test which was negative because I was not feeling well.  Then 9 days post vaccine I started to feel very fatigued, achey, and I couldn?t sleep well and like my nerves were burning up all over my body.  I had to call out of work due to brain fog, fatigue, nerve heat, difficulty concentrating.  I took my temperature during all this and it was 97.7.  My hands felt very hot and I could wash them under warm water because the water felt way too hot.

                                                On the day of the vaccination, I only had a little sore arm. But when I woke up the next day, around 4:30 am, I had a fever. I felt very cold and tried to sleep, but I could not fall asleep because of body aches and fever. So, I tried to get up and sit, but I could not and had to go back to bed with the pains and lethargy. I lied on the bed until around 8 am and realized that my fever was high. I took the temperature with my digital thermometer. It showed 108.7F. I could not believe it and retook it on my ears; it still showed 108.6F. My headache was really bad. So, I took 500mg Tylenol. The fever did not go away completely, and I had to keep sleeping the whole day. In the evening, before I went to bed, I took another 500 mg Tylenol and slept. I could not sleep well with the body aches. The next morning I still had 103F temp that slowly waned by the evening that day. Now I am feeling okay but have been struggling with a sleep problem.

Sore arm was mitigated with movement and stretching (as compared to the first dose). Other symptoms have lessened since 7am (19 hours after shot), but linger.  Ibuprofen seems to lessen, but not end eymptoms.

                                                Joint Pain, initially started primarily in pinky knuckle on Day 2 and each day progressed to additional knuckles on right hand until I could not make a fist at 4th day. Progressed to left hand and other joints (knees) by 4th day. Use of acetaminophen helped alleviate  pain and permitted more movement.   By day 6,  pain  reduced to no longer need medication. As of Today,  joints are still not back to normal still slightly tight. Injection site was sore for 5 days.

                                                My brother has epilepsy. His seizures can be triggered by low grade fever and exhaustion. He had covid in early October. His seizures are generally well controlled but he had several after the vaccine. I understand that the vaccine did not cause the seizures. The fever caused the seizure. I just think it?s important to neurologists to have this info to see how we can go about mitigating the seizures and if the 2nd dose is necessary. Keeping him hydrated may have helped and also giving him something immediately for the low grade fever. Just knowing these things may help others.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

                                                On the evening of Friday 4/2/2021 around 9:30 PM, I was experiencing what felt like heartburn. It got better before I went to bed. At around 9:00 AM on Saturday 4/3/2021, I was awakened by intense pain and pressure that felt like the worst heartburn I&#39;d ever experienced. After OTC heartburn treatments didn&#39;t help, at around 11:00 AM I went to the local ER where I was initially diagnosed as having a heart attack. After being given some baby aspirin and a nitro tablet, I started feeling better and was airlifted immediately to a nearby cardiology unit at another hospital. A heart catheterization and EKGs determined that I had not had a heart attack, but instead had takotsubo cardiomyopathy. I was admitted into the cardiac ICU overnight for observation, transferred to a non-critical room the next day (4/4/2021), and released on Monday 4/5/2021.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

Overnight, I experienced severe chills and body aches, and severe fatigue, which followed the rest of the morning (01/21/21) with general discomfort. By that early afternoon the chills subsided, and I continued to feel body aches with minimal joint pain. By 4 pm, I began to develop an itchy rash on my left wrist under my wristwatch, left hand and on my right forearm. I experience fatigue throughout the rest of the day. I used over the counter Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Cream to alleviate the itch.  On the Morning of 01/22/23, I woke up to a itchy rash over my torso and my hands. I continued to apply the cream and I took an OTC Benadryl allergy pill, which seems to subside the rash.  On 01/23/21, I woke up the the same  rash over my feet and overall, the rash over my torso and hands had substantially subsided.

After 2 hrs. of stacking blankets on me and putting a heating bad, my chills finally minimized. During this time, I also became nauseated and puked several times. after these events, I had a severe headache for most of the following day and a very sore arm.

                                                Began experiencing nausea and general stomach pains the morning after receiving the vaccine.  After one day of pain and discomfort I woke the following morning (~44hrs after receiving the vaccine) to extreme acute abdominal pain in the lower right abdomen.  Went to Urgent Care facility and was diagnosed by CT scan as having acute appendicitis.  An emergency appendectomy was scheduled and performed for later that evening.  I stayed at the Hospital overnight on 12/24/2020 post operatively on IV antibiotics to recover from the appendectomy.  Was discharged from the hospital on 12/25/2020 and have been recovering for about 10 days now with limitted activity.

Later in the day, while at work, I became extremely fatigued and my chills were getting worse.  I left work early, came home and checked my temperature.  It has been between 102.5 and 103.7 the entire time I have been home.  Even after taking Tylenol.  My arm is also a little tender at the injection site.    I had COVID prior to this but they say I recovered.    My symptoms started on November 13 and was hospitalized for 3 days starting around day 9 of symptoms.  My current symptoms are pretty much identical to the symptoms I had when I first contracted COVID.

The staff member monitoring saw me going to the floor and called the head doctor over to help.  They called EMT&#39;s.  I was laid onto the floor on my back and legs up onto a chair.  The staff took my blood pressure which was low.  Approximately, 2 minutes later, they took my blood pressure and it went back up to a more normal level.  The EMT&#39;s helped me up and took my blood sugar levels and pulse oxygen levels which seemed normal.  I was able to feel better, but the color of my skin was yellowish and pale.  The EMT&#39;s suggested that I talk with my doctor before getting another vaccine and talk about my symptoms.

The patient&#39;s medical history included type 1 diabetes. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 30 Dec 2020, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30 Dec 2020, the evening after vaccine administration, the patient experienced chills and tiredness.  On 31 Dec 2020 the patient woke up with his face numb and a little paralyzed. At the time of reporting, the patient mentioned that the numbness and paralysis on his face had been like that for various days and was still ongoing. Treatment for the event was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, chills and tiredness, was unknown. The outcome of the events, part of face numb and part of face a little paralyzed, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 45 year old male patient with medical history of type I diabetes, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Facial paralysis, a NS unexpected event of Hypoaesthesia, and NS expected events of Chills and Fatigue. The events of Chills and Fatigue occurred on the same day when the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273. The events of Facial paralysis and Hypoaesthesia occurred the next day of administration of mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I received the shot at 1030 in the morning.  Just after midnight of the next day, I woke up with a fever of 100.9, chills and body aches.  I did have some head congestion too.  It&#39;s now 1100am and I still have the same symptoms.  However the fever has dropped closer to 100.  I&#39;ve been taking Tylenol to help with the aches and fever.

Then severe rash over torso, arms, buttocks, thighs, and back consistent with what I experienced during Lyme Disease this past summer.  Raised itchy rash in large red blotches over most of body.  I didn&#39;t realize it at the time but the same (but less severe) reaction took place after the first Moderna Vaccine shot as well.  I was prescribed Doxycycline by my local Urgent Care and stayed on it for 14 days following the first dose of Moderna.  I didn&#39;t put the two things together immediately because I has gone hunting in the woods and assumed that I was bitten by another tick.  Full body rash is what caused me to go seek attention at the Urgent Care.  The symptoms following the second dose were much more severe and uncomfortable.  The rash subsided in 4-5 days without medication.

I then began feeling a severe pain in my left arm at the exact site of the injection that came and went depending on movement of my arm. It felt like a torn muscle. Now, 3 weeks after my final shot, the arm pain is still present and at times feels like it&#39;s worsening. It&#39;s at its most severe when reaching for something.

                                                I developed tinnitus in my ears about 3 to 4 hours after vaccine. I normally don&#39;t get this. Rarely after a concert or game but short lived. This has stuck around and I kept waiting for it to disappear. Unfortunately it has not. My right ear is worse than my left but the tinnitus remains so I thought I should report it. I have been looking on-line for any other reports and see none. This may be coincidence but due to lack of resolution of tinnitus, I thought I should report it. My flu-like symptoms (headache, shaking chills, sore arm) disappeared within 36 hours.

                                                I received my Moderna COVID-19 Vaccination at approximately 0800 am on February 10, 2021. At approximately 1800 hrs the same day, I experienced a sudden onset of muscle spasms to my lower back. I was at rest, sitting in a chair at the time of onset. The muscle spasm to my lower back was extremely intense and I had difficulty walking. This continued for about 1.5 hours. Also, during this time, I experienced cramping to the arches of both my feet. This was intermittent. I also had pain/soreness to my hips bilaterally. After approximately 1.5 hours the lower back spasms and cramping to my feet subsided.  I do not have a history of lower back issues and this is my first experience of spasms of my lower back.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

                                                About 6 minutes after a got first shot of moderna, I had felt fin. Then within 20-30 seconds I realized that my chest was heavy/pressure on my sternum, arms and torso went warm and sweaty, a bit light headed and had fast heart rate. I asked medical team for assistance. They took blood pressure/O2 levels and listen to my heart and lungs. Had epi pen ready, but never administered. Watched me like this for about hour and a half until my bp came back down to normal levels.

About one minute later he felt like he could not get a full breath and he felt the need to run away. We connected a heart monitor, did serial vital signs, listen to lung sounds. He symptoms seem to worsen. He did not have hives, his lungs were clear. His HR was normal but his B/P was elevated. We started and IV and gave him 25 mg mg of IV Benadryl. We contacted Dr. via phone. He talked to the patient and he agreed with our assessment and treatment.  He began feeling better about 10 min after the Benadryl and he symptoms cleared by 30 min after Benadryl. We kept him on the heart monitor for 1 hour.  He reported he felt fine and back to normal when he left to go home. He refused ambulance transport to the hospital. All reports will be filled out by me.

                                                Good morning, I received my 2nd shot yesterday at approximately 9:15a.  I had no issues during the observation period.  Last night at approximately 9:45p I started to feel as if I was catching a fever due to my joints aching and bland taste in my mouth.  At approximately 10:15p I started to shiver, had a headache and had tightness in the lower left side of my back.  So I took my temperature and I had a low grade fever 99.7.  At the point I went and had a hot shower.  After that I laid on the heating pad for 30 minutes and my back tightness subsided.  I stopped shivering at roughly 11:15p but continued to have a headache and aching joints.  My temperature right now is 100.3, joints are still aching but not as bad as last night, headache and chills.  Is there anything that I can take, Advil etc?  Also, I forgot to mention the arm soreness as well but I had that on the 1st shot as well.

It is unusual for me to have this many gout attacks in such a short time period. Additionally, physical activity has been very challenging since receiving the shot.  I fatigue and become short of breath very quickly. During the first workout that I did, on 02/01/2021, after receiving the shot I became extremely dizzy, my eyes became light sensitive and my hands trembled; symptoms lasted for approximately 45 minutes.

                                                The day after the injection I had a sore arm, slight headache and slight nausea. Since that time I have had a slight &#34;pressure&#34; headache almost continuously.  Today is 2/24/21, more than 6 weeks after the first shot and the symptoms have only slightly subsided. I have decided to forego the second shot until the symptoms completely disappear. I have not sought any medical care because the symptoms are not severe enough and I am hoping they will subside by themselves. If they continue for a long period I will seek medical care but my guess is there will not be a lot that can be done.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

The episode lasted for 30 seconds to 1 minute and he slept for about half an hour afterward. He has since been more subdued and listless but is beginning to display more of his typical behaviors again. She said he has had milder seizure like activity in past when his head tilts backward and he has stiffness and staring with last episode of this being 6 months ago. Last grand mal seizure occured when he was young and related to issues with his shunt.

Nest day woke up with severe pain in left arm from below the site of injection (upper triceps) region down to the elbow , got severe enough to not be able straighten my arm fully without major discomfort.  Took Advil 800 mg , that made it better but not completely. By evening time felt like i was tired and like what i feel like when i am about to get a cold.   Next day was not tired , feeling of getting sick was no longer there and pain got slightly better by midday.   Next day after that woke up with slight swelling in the site and the arm was red and was warm to touch.  That continued for 2 days and gradually got less red and swollen and started to itch.  Took almost a week for the itch to completely subside.

The headaches have been intermittent continuing on till the date of this report (02/04/21).  The patient has been taking acetaminophen with relieve.  On approximately 02/01, it was noted by coworkers that the patient&#39;s right side of the face would not move when he would talk.  Around the same time, the patients right eye became watery and the patient&#39;s wife stated she noted some gurgling.

                                                Starting the next day, I had an increased sensitivity to motion sickness.  This is unusual as I am a paramedic and work in an ambulance for a living.  I also suffered 2 nights of insomnia.  On the evening of the third day, I developed joint aches, fatigue, and a series of normal bowel movements (five in 2 hours). The next morning I added a lost of balance and a slight right side facial droop around my eye (no numbness). Later that day I developed nausea and vomiting, a single period of cold chills followed by a period of a hot flash.  However, I never developed a fever.  By day five, all of my symptoms resolved with the balance issue being the last.  Also of note, early on, my blood sugar was elevated, blood pressure was elevated, and pulse elevated.

                                                Started with tiredness, then arm got sore and was painful to lift. Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

PCP noted in retrospect, a similar event happened soon after his 1st vaccine dose - he received his first COVID-19 vaccine dose 1/26/21 at 13:00.  Nursing Progress note from 1/27/21 at 18:05, stated patient was transfered to ER for ??cool clammy skin and discoloration all over body?? (he was admitted for UTI, so it was thought his clammy discolored skin was associated with this acute illness) - He recovered from this first event without issue.

In fact, it is the gentlest shot I have ever received. Later that night I felt some pain in my left arm, which increased significantly that next day. The pain last for about two days, then almost suddenly went away. The pain then moved between by arm and neck for about 12 hours before going away. There were no other symptoms that I was aware of.

At first he said he felt uneasy and he then later described feeling &#34;like he was tripping&#34;.   He later started feeling confused.  He went to bed around 11p.m. and woke up feeling very tired and achy but was also having a lot of trouble concentrating.  Later in the evening he was acting very confused and he didn&#39;t look well at all.  He was having difficulty verbalizing and conveying his thoughts, he couldn&#39;t remember words and at one point he actually called me &#34;mom&#34;.  I am concerned.  He said he would contact the hotline for adverse reactions on 2/26 if he still felt the same, but I felt it was important to report it either way.  He has never behaved this way before and has no medical history of any sort of memory or mental issues.

While I do report my daily progress on V-SAFE it does not allow for detailed reporting and it does not have a radio button for hot flashes that WILL NOT GO AWAY.    Approx 30-60 min after the vaccine I did get a headache which has continued (still have it).  I did get dizziness and fatigue which has somewhat subsisted and has gotten better (comes and goes) but the headache remains and now I have hot flashes that came out of nowhere last night.  It continues with the headache.    Nothing has changed from my routine nor have I been around anyone new or traveled recently.

                                                My arm was sore for 3 days as though I had been punched really hard.  After that  my deltoid became incredibly irritated and I started having stabbing, excruciating pain in my should any time it moved.  This lasted until I went in to get a shot of local anaesthetic from my doctor  on 2/25/21.  I was taking advil, tylenol, a muscle relaxer, lydecane cream and then I got the shot of anaesthetic.  I slowly had a little bit of improvement in mobility.  13 days after my vaccine, I was no longer experiencing shooting pain in my shoulder.  It is now March 1st and I think I have regained about 70% of my  mobility in that arm.  I believe that the shot made my deltoid flex and freak out and this ended up causing bicep tendinitis.  This is also my doctor&#39;s theory.

                                                When administered, the first Moderna COVID shot leaked and I did not get the full dosage per the nurse.  She then gave me a second complete Moderna shot.  Both shots were in my left arm.  No real reaction at first except the typical arm pain.  However, I noticed something within the first day that I haven&#39;t noticed since.  First, I felt sharp pain in my left hand back around between my thumb and left pointer finger by the next day for about 30 min. and minutes later felt sharp pain in the top of my left foot.  I haven&#39;t experienced any further symptoms as the shoulder pain dissappeared in a few days but this does appear to be related to the shot in retrospect so felt it should be reported.

On a scale from one to ten, the level of discomfort was seven or eight. I had expected at least some soreness as I normally have soreness after receiving flu shots and other injections. However, I was very surprised as to how sore my arm really was. Fortunately, when I woke up the next day, January 10th, the pain had mostly subsided, with just a little swelling evident at the injection site.

Did not think too much of it at first, however the area grew a little and swelled up.  Consulted with my doctor and they diagnosed Shingles.  Am currently prescribed Valtrex for shingles.

Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia without fever was made, patient started azithromycin on 1/5 and albuterol treatments every 4-6 hrs. Initially he improved, but then worsened.  chest xray on 1/6 was negative for pneumonia, PCR covid test was negative, albuterol treatment did not bring much relief. He started respiratory distress on 1/10 and was taken by car to the local ER where another covid test was negative and chest CT revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli. The leg US revealed blood clots in both of his legs. He had an emergency catheter-delivered thrombolysis and was discharged home from the ICU on 1/12 on oral anticoagulants. He is gradually improving, but very weak. He tires easily and gets a drop in oxygen to 90- 93%, as well as an increase in the heart rate to 120  when walking less than half a mile. He runs out of breath with exertion.

Shortly after, fever developed over 100 degrees F.  By &#43;9 hours, fever reached 102, and I became disoriented badly, to include loss of balance and some speech issues.  Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.  All temps via temporal sensor thermometer.

The next day I was COVID tested it was negative. My symptoms continued  for several more days, I was thinking that this was a reaction because my arm still hurt and I was having fevers with a cough.

                                                Received Vaccine on Friday January 15th 2021 at approximately 0715am after my Isolation and having had no symptoms for over a week.  Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

                                                Upon waking up felt cold sweat, nauseated and became dizzy. Within 5 min from leaving the bed I lost consciousness for 2-3minutes. Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

                                                On 12 FEB 2021 I received my first dosage of the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine, Lot 016M20A. On the day of the vaccination, the pain from Psoriatic Arthritis  (primarily bi-lateral feet was low in comparison to the average level of pain over the last 7 days).  There was also discomfort in the hips which for time to time had presented with point pain at the connection of the hip to the Femur. BLUF: Most significant joint/muscoskeletal pain related to exacerbation locations for Psoriatic Arthritis that I have ever endured since receiving the injection.  Prepared for second vaccination, but fearful of PSA not being in control and dramatic escalation in discomfort in feet and hips, affecting ability to walk.  I received my vaccination at some time after 1400 hours, 12 FEB.  No issues noted until approximately 2300 hours, 12 FEB, when significant and debilitating pain was noted in multiple joints or areas affected by recent Psoriatic Arthritis exacerbations.   Initial Pain made it difficult to sleep from the 12th into the 13th due to significant discomfort. Through that first night, the pain immediately flared, bilateral feet, left and right hip and point pain at three locations on veterbrae, (lower, mid and upper back).  Pain was most pronounced in feet and left hip,  the feet (all toes seemed to throb in pain and were sensitive to touch or simple movements).  Pain in feet and left hip was a 10/10.  Left hip pain was slightly different than the point pain and seemed to radiate out from the area where it connects to the femur. 13 FEB: By 0815 on 13 FEB the pain in the right foot and right hip decreased, as well as the pain in the lower, mid and upper back but the pain in the left foot and left hip continued, slightly less strong than the night prior.  Pain level decreased to 8/10 for left foot and hip and was down to a 5/10 for the right foot and hip and a 3/10 for the areas on the back. In the evening of 13 FEB it was noted that the pain in the left hip became more generalize:d vice the specific point pain that I have witnessed off/on since SEP 2020.  Continued to note evening pain that felt like burning/tingling pain on both feet.  At this point the pain in the evenings appeared to be worse than the AM pain.   Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 It should be noted, that left shoulder discomfort from the injection never exceed 2/10 as it appeared 24 hours after the injection.  More pain in shoulder associated with mobility/rotation? I lacked the ability to simply walk through the house due to the pain throughout the past 36 hours.   14 FEB: Less discomfort in AM, but still greatest in left foot. Left Foot: 7/10 Fight foot: 4/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 3/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 4/10 PM:  Significant increase in pain at bed time. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 15 FEB: AM: continued lessening of pain/discomfort in AM, but appeared back throughout the day, worsening at evening.  Pain in left hip was noted to be much more pronounced shooting out in multiple directions, to include causing discomfort from the rear of the hip, and when seated shooting pain in the direction of my inner thigh from the back of my hip.  Pain in feet continues to be like a burning/tingling pain in the evening, most pronounced in 2nd and 3rd toes on my left foot and big toe and little toe on my right foot.  The pain also appears to be much greater at evening than in AM. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: Left Hip 8/10 right hip 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10-not much change-very point specific pain.. I am not witnessing fatigue or any other problems other than joint/musco skeletal pain.  I have also not been getting shooting pain in feet that has appeared from time to time which feels like someone hammering nails into individual toes or shots of violent pain, only a sustained burning/tingling pain. four days later the Psoriatic Arthritis locations continue to rage following the vaccine, most notably bilateral feet and left hip, where the pain in the hip appears to be radiating in multiple directions.

Patient was given a Benadryl and then sat for a couple of minutes.  Patient then stated she had difficulty breathing and was given a Epi Pen and 911 was called for a Ambulance.  Took patients vitals before Ambulance arrive and it was still stable.  Ambulance arrived and patient was taken to the hospital.

Periodic severe headaches continue, although these existed before receiving the vaccine and are linked to positive COVID in Nov 2020.

                                                Post shot developed the following within hours:  head congestion, dizziness, nausea, brain fogginess, phlegm in my heart, headache, inability to fully concentrate to typical ability, major soreness in arm receiving shot, soreness developed in arm that didn&#39;t receive the shot with intermittent shooting pain at opposite arm shot sight as if being stabbed with a knife.  Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

                                                Starting around 1:00 in the morning, the night of receiving the vaccine, I started with the aches, joint pain, chills, and low-grade fever.  I forced myself to go to work.  I am a Registered Nurse.  The joint pain and aches increased throughout the day along with altered periods of chills and hot flashes.  Around 6 PM on the 29th is started feeling worse.   I felt like I was tachycardic.  I had my wife take my blood pressure.  My normal vitals are Pulse-50, BP 110/60.  When I took my vitals at 6:00 pm my pulse was 91 and my BP was 85/53.  Clearly an allergic reaction.  I had no difficulty breathing.  Finally, around 1:00 am on 1/30, my fever broke and my heart rate and BP returned to normal ranges.  My first vaccination was unremarkable with only a sore arm for three day.

                                                Narrative: Patient is a 49 year old man with past medical history of hypertension and kidney stones who presented with a chief complaint of word finding difficulties and slurred speech. Patient was last seen normal at 1230 pm on 1/21/2021. He got his covid vaccine and shortly after he developed a headache that was on both sides of his head. Felt like 8/10 pain. He then had difficulty with speaking - he didn&#39;t know what word to say so he would make a noise. He was on the phone, and that person recommended that he come to the ED to get evaluated.In the ED, a stroke code was called. BP 169/97. NIHSS 0. A CT non con did not show any acute bleed or any signs of a stroke. After the stoke code was ended, the patient has a headache severity 1/10 and did not have any word finding difficulties. Patient was non focal by the time that the stroke code was ended. In the setting of hypertension, a blood pressure of 169/97 on admission and fluctuating symptoms, most concerning on the differential is a TIA. Given his risk factors and episodic presentation, he will need to be worked up for a stroke. The differential also includes post-vaccination reaction vs complex migraine.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

                                                Received Moderna COVID vaccination 4/1/21. About 27 hours later, he felt muscle spasming across his chest. He then developed neck pain, tingling that goes into right and left arms/fingers. Was started on oral steroids by his PCP on 4/6/21. Given worsening symptoms and new development of urinary retention. Patient was admitted to Hospital 4/8-4/11. Suspected to have cervical transverse myelitis.  Re-admitted 4/12 due to worsening generalized weakness, significant numbness, gait/coordination issues, and several falls. Differential diagnosis includes guillain barre syndrome vs. transverse myelitis. No MS on brain MRI. No cord lesion. Treatment included IVIG 0.5g/kg daily x 4 days, B12, 1 mg IM daily x 3 days. bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  4/7: MRI cervical spine: Small focal area of increased T2 signal within the central cervical cord at the C2 level without associated postcontrast enhancement. A demyelinating disease is leading differential consideration. 4/11: MRI brain: normal, no de-myelinating disease; MRI C-spine: severe cervical stenosis with flattening of spinal cord but no cord edema/enhancement.

                                                I experienced insidous onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations after approximately 2-3 minutes of inoculation.  This episode lasted about 1-2 minutes.  I was not expecting this having no prior history of adverse response to vaccines.  I also felt a flushing sensation in my head.   My breathing felt slightly more difficult.  No sweating, throat closure or itching.   I did not measure pulse and instead tried to breathe/meditate to bring it down.  I estimate it was about 140 bpm .  Breathing/meditation brought it down but it was still elevated when the nurse checked me after 20 minutes.  I remained onsite an additional 15 minutes until I felt well enough to leave but my heart rate was still somewhat elevated, about 20 bpm higher than my usual.   My heart rate seemed to fluctuate throughout the evening and my sleep was subsequently very poor.  I feel much better this morning, just the usual arm soreness after a vaccination.  I have reached out to my primary doctor concerning whether she feels this event would warrant my not getting the second dose or perhaps having a prescribed epipen on my person.  Having no personal history but a family history of severe heart disease (father had first MI at age 42, second at 44 followed by triple bypass and CHF) this incident with my heart rate certainly raised some anxiety.  I had a routine EKG done in June which was normal, I am a physical therapist and in good health.  I am hoping to have the next vaccine in a proper medical facility.   I have read CDC recommendations to not have the second shot if certain adverse responses are experienced and I am not certain whether this would qualify.   I have no history of adverse reactions to vaccines.    Considering the role of anxiety versus the insidious and nearly immediate onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations and persistent elevated heart rate for more than 12 hours, I feel this event was primarily driven by the vaccine.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                Right after the vaccine I just had a slight head ache. I had pretty typical symptoms. Around 8pm my arm got to 8/10 pain. I have waves of Tachycardia and nausea. I had pretty bad diarrhea the first day and second day, this was also a side effect from the Celexa. The Tachycardia was going up to 130-140 .  Very much flu like symptoms, heart pounding, head pounding and very light headed. I was having trouble controlling BP when I stood up.  I felt feverish, I kept checking my temp but it was normal.  This went on for two day, I wasn&#39;t able to eat or drink liquids. I ended up going and getting a Covid test on Tuesday morning, I was feeling somewhat ok. Then in the evening all my same symptoms came back.  I spoke with a Dr. who informed me I was probably dehydrated. I almost went into the Emergency Room because my high heart rate and thought I was having a heart attack. I didn&#39;t due to high volume of Covid in the ER. I have a follow up meeting with my PA before my second dose to come up with a strategy.  The left side of my face started to get numb and the left side of neck. My neck started to get still and went to my jaw.

                                                I received shot in left arm.  I began getting sore in injection area which I expected.  At around 630 in the evening, I began to feel a sharp pain going down my left arm from middle of shoulder to the hand.  This especially happened when I raised my arm.  I kept my left arm down to side trying to slowly move it during the day.  I contact Hot line for Hospital and explained issues.  They described certain reasons but said that I could take Motrin.  I began taking Motrin every 4 hours.  The next day I was able to raise arm about half way. The pain became a dull and aching from shoulder to hand. I continue to take Motrin.

                                                My Left shoulder became red at the injection site and swollen.  I also have pain and stiffness going from the injection site all the way up to the base of my skull.  If I look down at my hands, my cell phone, the ground or even at a desk too long, the left side of my neck gets so stiff that it hurts to raise my head back up to normal height.  The muscles in my left shoulder and left side of my neck are so tight that it seems like I have been lifting weights for days.  I have not worked out in months.  Today is 1/23/21 and I still have the problem.   I also had a migraine headache for three to four days after the vaccine.

                                                I began with chills on Weds. morning around 10am that only got worse not matter what I did. My arm continued to hurt but I thought it was just the injection pain. I then began to exhibit a temperature (100.3) and to feel fatigued and had a bad headache by late Weds. afternoon and evening.(These symptoms were similar to those I suffered when I had Covid back at the beginning of August, minus the throat pain and breathing issues I suffered.  By that night my arm was throbbing and I had fevers that ran as high as 102.7 and suffered multiple night sweats. My wife noticed swelling in my upper left arm and on Thurs. I contacted my Dr. who directed me to take tylenol and apply ice to the swelling. Which I did all day Thursday. The fatigue, fever and headache persisted all day Thursday and my arm began hurting more. I began to notice discomfort in my underarm (left) and my wife (a nurse) noticed it was swollen (softball size), warm to the touch and extending into my left pectoral muscle. I began applying ice to this area also but it had no impact. Contacting my Dr. on Friday about the new swelling, she examined me on Fri. afternoon and prescribed me Cephalexin, Medrol Dose Pack steroid, and over-the-counter Clariton allergy medicine, which I began Friday night. My fever began to subside and by Sat. morning my arm pain began to lessen and some of the swelling went down. Now Sunday morning, the fatigue, fevers and headache have gone, and most of my arm pain in gone (still tender to the touch), I still have some swelling in both upper left arm and Underarm pit. Dr. feels this was and allergic reaction and recommends I do not get the second injection.

I was down and couldn&#39;t function. I took Ibuprofen and tylenol - and it helped with aches and pains a little but not with tiredness and overall feeling bad. I took the 3rd and 4th off but went back to work on 5th although I was sluggish. Felt a lot better on Saturday.

Had second dose of vaccine on February 2nd.

                                                I had a lot of the usual adverse events, but yesterday (a week after the 2nd dose) I got a very bad, burning rash, a raised, red area, on my brow, an area where I sometimes have dermatitis. It doesn&#39;t burn as much today but is still puffy and red. I think the vaccine supercharged (for lack of a better word) the dermatitis.

                                                I had previous neurologic issues due to cervical disc disease that resolved after surgery 5/2020. Interestingly, after dose 1 and again after dose 2 of Moderna in my right arm, I developed left hand pain (previous radicular symptom) and I developed shaking of my head from side to side (like a tremor of my neck musculature). After the first vaccine, the hand pain resolved in about a week. Same with the head tremor. After the second vaccine, the hand pain is present Day 4 post vaccine, the head shaking resolved Day 2 post vaccine. It seems my body&#39;s response to the spike protein is to trigger inflammation in previously irritates neuronal tissue of the peripheral nervous system, but possible spinal cord.

Over the course of the next  6 hours, my blood pressure plummeted to 82/63. I countered this by intaking large amounts of salt, and ultimately took my Diltiazem and some Tylenol PM.  Around 3 am my blood pressure returned to normal and currently holding steady at 118/83,  I am monitoring it throughout the day, but it seems stable.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

                                                I experienced &#34;Moderna Arm&#34; on the day following the injection, but it subsided after a couple of days. Eight days later, though, it returned (swelling/redness/milder pain) -- accompanied by swelling in my right ankle and tightness/some tingling/mild pain in my right ankle/upper calf. I suffered a blood clot for the first time in each leg in early November; the more serious of the two was in the vicinity of my upper calf in my right leg. In December, I began to experience sensations in my right ankle that were similar (albeit more intense) to what I later experienced after my vaccine; the post-vaccination symptom in my right calf was also similar (but milder) to what I had experienced from the DVT.

                                                So basically I believe I have Bell&#39;s palsy  .  After about an hour after receiving the vaccine I noticed I was having a weird taste in my mouth. Sort of a metallic taste. As the weekend went on it seemed to get worse. Then Monday morning I noticed when brushing my teeth that I wasn?t able to  gurgle my mouth wash. And saw that my mouth and eye seemed to be drooping slightly. Now Thursday the 21st and it seems to be effecting my speech to were I now have a lisp. Can definitely see it when I?m speaking to someone. Which people have commented on.  Not sure what can be done . But at this point I?m hoping it doesn?t get worse. Thanks

                                                The evening of 1/11/21 - pain at the injection site and feeling of fatigue - went to bed very early.  Arm pain a bit less next day - felt a little tired all day. Back to &#34;normal&#34; on the 13th.   I am not sure if the following symptoms are related to the vaccine but I feel like I should report them if there may be a link.  1/17/21 -Awoke in the morning with severe neck pain - muscles &#34;locked up.&#34;  Called the doctor - he prescribed Tramadol and Cyclobenzaprine - I took these for two days before my neck calmed back down and I could function &#34;normally&#34; again.  1/28/21 - Started feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; and tired late in the day while still at work.  Went home and went to bed early.  1/29/21 - Felt same as last PM upon waking up.  Felt much better by mid-morning.  Started feeling bad again later in the day.  Felt cold - but no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  1/30/21 - Felt bad all day.  Felt cold - no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  AM - felt anxious, worried, confused.  Built a fire in the fireplace and heat made me feel better. Felt hot-cold-hot-cold- all day.  My neck ached all day.  Sensitive to sounds. Took a single cyclobenzaprine late in the day - seemed to help. Went to bed early.  1/31/21 - Woke up with very sore deltoid muscle at the site of COVID-19 injection. Very hard to lift arm above head.  Hips, back, and neck muscles ache.  Calf muscles feel almost like they are about to cramp.  Mental state better than yesterday. Still sound sensitive. Not as cold feeling as in days prior.  Yoga seems to help.

Day 2: Next morning was difficult getting out of bed. Skin was very sensitive to warm/hot shower water. Achy joints all over. Even my left injection site was sore even though I was injected on the right side. Fatigue at work. I was very wide eyed as described by co-worker. I was a little loopy as I was very giggly and things made me laugh way more than usual. I may have been a little delirious but I was able to work. This lasted until I went to bed. Day 3: When I awoke I felt like a fever had broke, Cooling sweat, but my temp was never over 98.5 degrees. My normal morning temp is usually 97.3 every day, but that one degree made a difference. I feel normal today and realize I was not well the day before.

By the following morning, I felt that skin area, as well as the area around both of my eyes to feel as if I had sustained second degree burns. Additionally, the skin around my eyes particularly, presented with extreme dryness and geriatric symptoms, such as wrinkling and streched thinned skin, as if I were an elderly person (over 75 years old, and not 52).  The flaring/burning subsided after 4-5 days. However, the skin dryness around the eyes has persisted to this day (i.e. 5 weeks past the 1st vaccination). A day after the 2nd part of the vaccination, I felt moderate dizziness and headache, which lasted for about 24 hours. Also, light soreness and skin stiffening were experienced at the arm location where the shot was adminmistered.

                                                On Saturday, January 30, 2021 I began experiencing an altered sense of taste with a metallic taste all through my mouth and tingling in my mouth.  I mostly felt ill throughout the day with low-grade fever, fatigue, body aches.  This continued on Sunday, January 31, 2021 and Sunday evening, I noticed a small droop in the upper lip on the right side of my mouth.  When I awakened, Monday, February 1, 2021, I had full right-side paralysis of the face, severe right eye, right jaw and right ear pain, severe fatigue, continued body aches.  After going to the ER where tests were performed to rule out stroke and sepsis, I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy.

The next day his symptoms got worse so he took Benadryl since he thought he was having an allergic reaction but he continued to get worse.  The third day his speech was getting worse, his face continued to swell and droop and he still had severe headache on the left side.  Pt ended up going to the ER where they did a CT, EKG, Chest X-Ray, blood work, gave him IV fluids and steroids. The ER Dr. consulted a Neurologist which told him he had the symptoms of Bell Palsy so they did the stroke protocol but ended up telling him his symptoms were from taking the Covid Vaccine.   He was told to finish his medicine that they prescribed which is steroid and antibiotic and if he did not get any better to come back for FU.

He was found to be in fine ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation efforts failed. He was brought to Hospital ED where he was pronounced dead. He had underlying cardiac disease but his family requested I report this event as possibly related to the recent COVID vaccination.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

The next day (DEC 30th) I continued with a mild headache and the injection site pain had increased. By 1800 hrs on the 30th while at work I began not to feel well. Body aches all over along with headache. When I arrived home that night around 2300 hrs I was feeling flushed and the body aches had increased. I took my temperature several times that night with different thermometers to make sure I was getting accurate temp readings. My average temps consisted of 99.8. I did take iburofen that night. The following morning my temp was normal and the body aches had subsided. I continued to have a headache that day being DEC 31st. To note: I never had any prior symptoms, nor ever being covid positive to my knowledge. I had two prior surgeries, first procedure on NOV 4 and another procedure on DEC 9 of 2020. I was tested for Covid prior to both procedures which were negative results.

                                                Initially there was soreness at injection site which lasted about a week, lessening with each day. I was incredibly fatigued for about three days after. Also, the entire right forearm felt sore for about a week, as well. The day after vaccine shot, my right testes was achey and sore (and still is uncomfortable) Also, the top side of my right foot was very tender. During the course of the week, that part of my foot became lightly swollen as did the front of my right leg, up to the top of the shin bone. Today?s date: 1/22/21 5:19 pm and leg and foot still tender and slightly swollen.

We instructed him to take off his jacket and gave him a cool rag. After the 15 minutes of observation were up, he felt good. He denied any s/s of dizziness or light-headiness or shortness of breath. I called to check on him today and he reported that he feels a little tired and has some nausea at times. His arm is a little sore, but he is doing ok.

During his observation period he reported that he had a racing heart, shaky hands, and was sweating.  Staff monitored him and got him some water.  He stated that he had a history of hypoglycemia as well but had not had issues with it in a while.  Patient reported that his BG had been 80 that morning and that he had eaten Chick Fil a prior to coming for the vaccine.  We offered a snack or glucose tablet but patient refused.  We did recommend that the patient remain in our observation are a for an extra 15 minutes and he agreed.  After monitoring and water the patient felt better and purchased glucose tablets when he left.

                                                After the vaccination  on 1/18/2021 , I had just pain at the site of injection in my left arm for the next 2   to 3 days  and headache.  Took Advil and it went away. After 3 or 4 days i started feeling very mild pain inside my arm muscles between  the injection site and my elbow  which continued till 1/25/2021.   Later this  very mild internal pain shifted  to my elbow  and   feel a mild numbing sensation in my pinky finger.  It also feels little heavy when I move my arm.  This  continues till  today as I am reporting on 1/30/2021 3:30pm.  Since it has not bothered much , I did not seek medical care, hoping this will  go away in few weeks.

                                                Went to my doctor thinking it was a very very bad sinus infection. My doctor didn&#39;t think it was with the way my headaches were. It hurt on the back right and above the right ear. It hurt to touch. My tongue is not functjioning now.  I had to get a MRI because they thought it could of been a mini stroke. MRI came back negative the doctors told me Bell Palsy.  They advise me not to get my second dose on 2/3/21.

                                                Patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical history who presents with complaint of sudden onset of left-sided nonradiating chest discomfort of sudden onset approximately 1 hour prior to presentation while doing administrative work at rest.    He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient&#39;s Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient&#39;s tachycardia patient&#39;s Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily. (Please note clarification in comparison to discharge home med list.  Toprol XL 25 mg daily was called to pharmacy in place of the metoprolol.)

Noticed that when my arm is to the side of my body, it started going numb- right arm. I also had to get up around 4 times to urinate a lot. I was getting night sweats. When I would get up, I had a slight head ache and dizziness. I still have it right now, the headache and dizziness. Even when I walk, I have to extend my pinky finger out so my arm will not go numb. As we are speaking right now, my pinky finger is going numb. Once I extend it out, it goes away, but when I put it down by my side, it goes numb. My whole body is sore as well.

                                                vaccine leaked; Very minimal pain in my arm; A spontaneous report was received from a non-health professional concerning a 55-year-old male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced very minimal pain in arm and vaccine leaked.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.    On 29 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 29 Dec 2020, during vaccine administration, the patient experienced vaccine leaked and very minimal pain in arm. The patient was unsure whether he received the full vaccine dose due to the leak. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the event, very minimal pain in my arm, was not reported. The outcome of the event, vaccine leaked, was considered resolved on 29 DEC 2020.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 55 year old male patient. The patient&#39;s medical history is not provided. The patient who experienced an unexpected event of vaccine leakage. The event occurred on 29 Dec 2020 during administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273. The event is unrelated to mRNA-1273. The patient experienced very minimal pain in the arm. This will be assessed after the updating of the event term.

The patient&#39;s medical history included daily exercise and no personal or family history of clotting issues and no trauma. Products known to have been used by the patient were not provided.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039k20-2a) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 30 Jan 2021, approximately 28 days after the first dose, and prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012m20a) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Jan 2021, the patient reports that for the first 18 hours, he experienced fever, chills and myalgia.   On 01 Feb 2021, the patient reports that he thought the myalgia was continuing, as he had pain in his chest and back. The chest pains gradually worsened.  On 05 Feb 20221, the patient went to the emergency room and was admitted.  He was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. He was started on enoxaparin sodium but switched to apixaban. A computerized tomography study of the lungs showed that he had bilateral pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct and atelectasis. His dimer was 4800. COVID-19 test was negative.  An echocardiograph was performed, no results were reported. An ultrasound of the legs was performed and ruled out deep vein thrombosis. Date of discharge was not specified.  On an unknown date two days after discharge, the patient experienced left leg pain and returned to the emergency department. Patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis that ran the entire length of the femoral artery. Patient was switched back to enoxaparin sodium and taken off the apixaban. A repeat computerized tomography study was done to see if the pulmonary embolism was progressing and it was not, however, it showed pulmonary effusions. All current lab work was reported as normal, except for an increased prothrombin time. COVID-19 test was negative.  Patient continues to be followed by a pulmonologist and hematologist.  Consent to contact patient, pulmonologist and hematologist was obtained.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, fever/pyrexia, chills, myalgia, chest and back pains, bilateral pulmonary embolism/pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct/pulmonary infarct, ateltheisis/atelectasis, left leg pain, and deep vein thrombosis, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this events has been provided at this time.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA Got vaccine 4pm.  I ate dinner at 6pm.  At 8pm felt slightly nauseous.  By 9pm it was worse.  By 9 30pm I was nauseous and full blow stomach pain.  My stomach was &#39;roiling or churning.&#39;   Then between 9 30pm and 2 30am the next day I was nauseous, had stomach pain, I felt hot and cold and my head became more congested and I got a headache.  Note: the head congestion was there prior to getting the vaccine, but it got worse.   I sipped water throughout and it felt like I had to vomit (but I did not vomit).   I took my temperature a few times it ranged from 98 to 98.8.   My normal temperature is 97 to 97.5.   By morning, or about 4am the worse symptoms were gone.  My stomach felt more or less ok and at 7am  I ate a light breakfast without incident.   My temperature seemed to be elevated through the day.  I felt somewhat weak during the day.  Worst effects seem gone by Jan 8 evening.   The only effect left is pain in my left upper arm.  I consider these to be significant and worrying side effects and I may not take the second dose.

                                                Significant flu like symptoms that lasted for 36 hours from onset.  Included a fever of over 101, sweats, chills and uncontrollable shivering.  Had some numbness in fingers and toes.  These symptoms were actually more severe that when I had Covid 19. Taking Tylenol would help ease the symptoms, I did rotate in a dose of Ibuprofen on a 2 hour interval one time during the worst of the symptoms. After the 36 hour mark the symptoms faded and I returned to a normal state, although very drained and fatigued. The severity of the symptoms seem like they would be dangerous for someone who is not in good health.

                                                12 hours after began to have a scratch throat.  at 13 hours post dose, had a headache start and an unusual erythematous spot on the posterior palate above Uvula with almost a white scratch appearance inside the erythema.  16 hours post dose began to have fevers and chills.  At 17 hours had severe sweats that soaked the bed with rigorous chills including teeth chattering shaking chills.  Took 800mg ibuprofen and went back to sleep.  Poor sleep with many awakenings.  Woke 22 hours post dose with no fevers or chills any longer but had headache that is different than my usual migraines or tension headaches.  Took 2 Fioricet with minimal change in headache.  Felt off for most of the day, and felt warm and achy.  Next night of sleep was again restless with some sweating beyond usual and awakened with swelling feeling in throat during the night.  Woke 46 hours post dose with headache again, as well as substantial uvula and soft palate edema with mild erythematous appearance.  The swelling gave me a fullness felling that made it hard to swallow and felt like my voice was changed.  I have had this same uvula edema in the past with rare allergic reactions to food, and flower that I once smelled.  The Uvula looks like a water filled ballon.  NO nodes in the neck.  The injection site has had mild induration, and swelling and has been itchy.  Headaches have persisted to a moderate extent.  Uvula Swelling has persisted to the point that I took a dose of prednisone 52 hours post vaccine.    It is now 54 hours post dose and I just feel a bit off, swollen uvula, headache and itchy vaccine site.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA I have sciatic and have had a rhyzotomy on my right side. On 15 Jan, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I began to get back and leg aches from my sciatica, but on my left side.  I immediately began my routine (exercise) and back brace which usually stop the pain. Over the next two day, the symptoms got worse to the point of extreme pain in my back and all down my left leg.  This resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 17 January.  I have since had an appointment with my pain specialist, and an MRI.  We are awaiting results from the MRI.  The pain has not lessened, and pain medication are only mildly effective. The pain being in my left side make since as the Rhyzotomy had been done on my right side.  I am concerned the vaccine may have cause tissue or nerve swelling. Pain is still intense to the point of immobility and difficulty sleeping.

                                                Patient came to the emergency department on 02/02/2020 at 2:30 pm to be evaluated for possible stroke due to sudden acute numbness, weakness in right wrist and arm, but no pain. Patient has no prior history of sudden acute numbness in arm and did not report any recent injury to his arm. Neurologist evaluated patient for possible stroke and patient was unable to lift right wrist and hand. Patient was able to lift both arms overhead, lift both legs, smile normal, open and close mouth and move tongue.  Both CT Scan and MRI were normal. Neurologist and emergency medical specialist determined that patient did not have a stroke and diagnosed acute brachial plexus palsy possibly due to patient sleeping in an awkward position. Emergency specialist said it was unlikely but could not rule out the possibility of an adverse reaction to the Moderna vaccine, which patient had received 10 days earlier (second dose, see details above.)

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 09 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine the patient had sore arm. On an unspecified date in Jan 2021, the patient had experienced a pull in his muscle in his calf and lower calf area got swollen. On 09 Feb 2021, after receiving the second dose of vaccine he had experienced a sore arm. On 11 Mar 2021, his leg got really swollen and on 12 Mar 2021, he visited hospital where it got diagnosed as DVT in his right lower calf. Treatment for the events included blood thinner Apixaban. Patient is concerned about possibility of indirect relation of events to the vaccine.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the event DVT, leg got really swollen, swelling of the lower calf area and calf pain were unknown at the time of this report. The event pulled a muscle is not resolved. The event sore arm which the patient experienced for both the doses got resolved on 13 Jan and 14 Jan 2021, respectively.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association a causal association between the event of sore arm and the administration of mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded.  The evens of DVT , pulled muscle and swelling of lower calf is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Events were all attributed to muscle strain.

                                                About an hour after he received his vaccine, he experienced tachycardia, tremors that lasted about an hour, his hands and face turned red, he experienced mental fogginess, and his vision &#34;went out&#34; for a short time. He ate a little bit of food, took some food, went home and rested and his symptoms calmed down. The next day (Saturday) he just felt fatigued. He did say that he had not ate breakfast before receiving his vaccine. He also spoke with a family member who is a doctor but did not actually go to a doctor&#39;s office/clinic.

It looks like bee stings bigger then a quarter 3 on my stomach and 3 on back. Lots of little bumps. It hurts very sensitive. I felt like my ribs and kidney were hurting but it is because of the nerves when I touch them.  This is been about a week. I am going to call my doctor. The pain is not just one spot but the whole area around them.

It might be 20A at the end and not 2OA with the letter O.  As for the adverse event, after 24 hours had a bit a sore arm, some redness and hardness in the area of the injection.  Seemed to go away in a day or so for the most part then I forgot about it until last night, 2-22-21 (eight days after injection) when I noticed rather large oval-shaped red mark about the size of an egg.  Slightly elevated but not bad.  No pain.  A little itchy but not bad.  So I googled it quickly today and I find out that it&#39;s not all that uncommon and likely more common than you realize because most guys aren&#39;t going to take the time to report something like this, in my opinion.   I see that some of the health care workers are being quoted as saying it&#39;s probably either an allergic reaction to a vaccine ingredient or an immune system reaction.  In my opinion it&#39;s the latter, at least with respect to me as several years ago after being bitten by a honeybee in palm of hand in fat part near thumb a similar thing happened.where it hurt and was red for a day or two or three and then seemed to recede but then came back with a red mark bigger than before, but it didn&#39;t hurt much, more of an itch if I recall correctly.  So for some reason that&#39;s apparently how my immune system fights off something foreign.  I have type A blood I believe, if that matters.  I think I have a pretty good strong immune system for my age, as well.  Hopefully the second shot will not produce that much more of a reaction because of this or how I&#39;m reacting now to the first shot.  No big deal just a lot of unknowns.  I&#39;ll follow the news on this in the next couple weeks and report back if anything develops further.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.

                                                Approximately 3 minutes after the injection I began to experience palpitations and felt flushed.  My heart rate increased from about 70 to 110.  This lasted for approximately 5 minutes and then recurred about 10 minutes later.  After the second event I took Benadryl 50mg po.  I experienced palpitations and felt flush a third time about 5 minutes after taking Benadryl  lasting about 2 minutes.  Approximately 40 minutes after the injection I began to feel cold and clammy, this lasted about 35 minutes. My pulse was about 75 and BP 140/90 during this last event.  Approximately 90 minutes after the injection I went home and experienced intermittent chills for a few hours then I was asymptotic.

                                                After a couple of days started feeling pain in the right elbow.  I thought it would go away.  It didn&#39;t. As of today pain is still there it is not as bad but still there 27 days later.  Also my left thumb is numb and sometimes radiates to the forearm area.  I have just started taking 200 mg ibuprofen as needed.  Helps with the right elbow but no relief to the left thumb.  I am due for 2nd vaccine tomorrow!

These faded over the afternoon only to recur at the same time next morning, resolving in the afternoon once again. I was afraid i was having a heart attack and called 911 and was taken to Hospital where I ruled out for an MI. In the ambulance i received four baby aspirin. I was discharged that night. The next morning, i  developed poor balance and fell twice while walking. Weakness also recurred with confusion. I could not stand myself up. I went to another Hospital and spent the night in Observation. The next morning no symptoms occurred but I refrained from walking as much as possible that day. At hospital I received IV fluid and my usual medications. Neurology consultation revealed possibly abnormal reflexes and poor balance. I received a cane from physical therapy. Since then symptoms have mostly not resolved but weakness and falls have recurred. Evaluation for fall and poor balance continues to date. I received the second dose of the Moderna immunization as scheduled without incident.
