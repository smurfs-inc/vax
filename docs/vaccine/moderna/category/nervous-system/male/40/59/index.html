Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                At about 1330 on 30DEC, the patient received the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Less than five minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient noticed a metallic taste.  About two to three minutes afterwards, the patient noticed a ?tingling? sensation mostly on the left side of the face and minimally on the right side.  Almost immediately after the ?tingling? sensation, the patient felt the sensation of an increased heart rate and checked his pulse with his watch that had a pulse sensor.  The watch indicated that he had a heart rate of 115 bpm.  This sensation of an increased heart rate subsided after for one or two minutes and repeat pulse measurement was in the low 90s.  Towards the end of the 15 minute post-vaccination observation period, the medical technician did the final check on the patient.  The patient admitted to experiencing a metallic taste and a mild tingling sensation on the neck and face area.  The service member was immediately brought back to the treatment room were a faint red rash and was noticed on the left side of the neck by the medical providers present.  Two doses of Benadryl 25mg were given and the patient was told to continue to be observed in the observation area.  After about 20 minutes, the tingling sensation resolved.  The patient checked his pulse again and it was in the low 70s.  The metallic taste resolved after about one and a half hours after the start of the symptom.

                                                After about 15 minutes, I began to feel lightheaded and experience a tingling in my arms/hands. I&#39;d guess it was related to the nerves in the arms, because it specifically affected my pinky and ring fingers on both hands. I was also unsteady on my feet, but did not lose consciousness. The lightheadedness and tingling continued off and on for most of the day. The tingling appeared to go away the next day, but I still experienced periodic (though rare) feelings of lightheadedness. Perhaps 2-3 time the next day (Saturday) and experienced maybe 1-2 times the following day (Sunday). I did not take Adderall on the weekend. On Monday, I did take Adderall and returned to work, where I experience some tingling again and longer bouts of lightheadedness. Again, I have not lost consciousness.

He pulled over and threw up. Once he got to work he vomited again. He drove to another facility for work and then threw up 3 or 4 more times. He began experiencing hot flashes at this time. He went to the hospital and was seen in the emergency room. He threw up several more times in the ER and stated that his heart was racing and that he had diarrhea. The emergency room gave him medications for the nausea and he stayed there for 2 or 3 hours. He began to feel better and was discharged to home.

                                                Sore shoulder started after a couple of hours and was moderate by evening. A general unusual feeling started within a couple hours of the shot.  By 7pm I started to experience chills and joint fatigue in legs (knees, toes).  Chills became severe and a low grade fever of 100.6 developed.  Chills lasted about 1.5hrs.  Fever broke overnight. By morning all previous issues were resolved and the only issue was a problem with equilibrium and balance (and sore shoulder)  It was a general feeling similar to drunkenness.  This issue persisted throughout the day and by evening I was experiencing mild vertigo when I closed my eyes. I went to bed feeling somewhat improved relative to all the symptoms but woke having experienced a cold sweat. My shirt was completely soaked. I noted several less significant sweating issues throughout this day with no other side effects. This was the final day with notable symptoms. At the time of this report I have minor shoulder pain as the only symptom that persisted throughout. The equilibrium symptoms were severe enough that I missed a day of work.

The left side of my tongue is numb with slight pain, and my bottom lip is numb on the left side, and the feeling stops at the middle like there were a line drawn down my face.  My upper left cheek and the side of my left eye have a constant,  moderate burning feeling.  The shot was in my left arm.  The Dr. at urgent care said it was not a stroke, so that&#39;s good.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  It has now been over 13 hours.

                                                The shot was administered in my left arm.  I experienced localized swelling and axillary lymph node tenderness immediately after injection under my left armpit.  The right side of my face also became numb for about 5 minutes.  The next morning the areas around my eyes were swollen and I had two styes in my right eye.  I do not know if these were related.  These symptoms lasted approximately 3 days.  Some minimal swelling and tenderness seemed to remain, and approximately a week later I experienced a painful resurgence of the swelling at the injection site that was far larger, harder and more painful.  I took Benadryl and Ibuprofen.  These relieved the symptoms within 48 hours.

                                                Normally sore following the vaccine starting around 9:00 PM last night.  Had shivers, nothing terrible.  By 6:00 AM the chills were intense, weakness, having less coordination and depth perception issue.  Closer to 9:00-10:00 AM felt like he had the flu 10 times worse than he should have.  Had COVID in April/May but these symptoms worse.  Got home at 11:15 AM was so cold, hands were ice cold, and took 2 hours of sleeping and all layers of clothing to feel warm.  Took a few layers off and still shaking, feverish and feeling of worse flu to man. Pain all over the body, temperature at 3:30 is 99.5-100.4, above 98 is fever is fever for him, normal is 96-97.  Sharp shooting muscle pains in extremities, top part of the hands, muscles, tendons, and also his legs and feet, but not fingers or toes.  Pain is quite intense.  All he wants to do is lay down in sleep.   Thought he was going to freeze to death.  Hands were so cold his kids were concerned.  Ice packs on chest, and gloves and 10 layers on hands and arms.  Had tremendous trouble breathing while having the intense chills.    He is a responder for law enforcement.   Symptoms have improved some, but still feeling feverish with shooting pains, depth perception issues, as well as pain.  Headache in back of head, pressure type.  Called off for work for today and tomorrow.

Approximately 48 hours later (evening 01/14/2021) started to notice increased inflammation about the size of a &#34;quarter&#34; on left side of chin. I did have a pimple/ingrown hair at this site prior to the injection which was mostly healed but not entirely healed. The next morning, 01/15/2021, I experience mild facial numbness to the left side of my chin and mild facial paralysis resulting in an asymmetrical smile, and mild swelling to the left side of my face. Two day later (morning 01/17/2021) with my symptoms not worsening but showing only a little improvement, I went to my local urgent care for evaluation. Provider was not 100% sure of the diagnosis but felt this could be a case of shingles or folliculitis. I was treated with a 7 day course of acyclovir and a 10 day course of doxycycline hyclate. The numbness subsided 2-3 days after treatment began. The facial paralysis and swelling showed much improvement (90-95%) after completing the acyclovir on 01/24/2021; however, I feel there is still a little more improvement to go.

He said he felt like his head was being compressed. His lower lip began to feel numb and tingly, eventually this feeling spread into his mouth and throat. He was coherent the entire time. He received oral Benadryl while waiting for his wife to arrive to drive him to the emergency room.

This was followed by body aches pains and chills. It also included heightened skin sensitivity. Physical touch and contact on anywhere but my palms in the pads of my feet was extremely painful. The best example I can give is, taking a shower was like getting shot at by multiple BB gun pellets.   At 1450 PST, I experience shortness of breath and wheezing. Struggled to walk up 12 steps.  Continued with migraine. Weakness in body. Pain and body. Skin sensitive until about 36 hours after the vaccine. Did not try walking up and down stairs again, but breathing was slightly challenged Until about 30 hour mark.  Struggled with migraines from The 24 hour mark until the 48 hour mark.It was the weekend. I did not go in. I just graded it out. Fatigue lasted all the way until the 48 hour mark.  Funny enough? I did not developed a sore arm symptom.

                                                Received first dose of Moderna vaccine on Tuesday 2/23/2021 and began to feel tingling on the right side of my head and an ear ache the next day (Wednesday 2/24/2021). The symptoms got progressively worse over the next few days and on Sunday 2/28/2021 the right side of my face was completely paralyzed. I sought emergency care at Hospital Emergency Room where I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. The doctor who treated me strongly believes that the Bells Palsy was due to the Moderna vaccine. Today (9 days post vaccine) the entire right side of my face continues to be completely paralyzed with no signs of improvement.

                                                Patient received vaccine at 3:15 pm on 3/12/21 and stayed in pharmacy area for 15 min (he left feeling fine). After about an hour 4:15 he showed back up at the pharmacy telling our pharmacy technician that he lost his voice and his throat was closing. She rushed him to the waiting room where I, pharmacist, came out and asked him what was going on. He stated he was with a client and suddenly lost his voice, and felt his throat starting to close. I asked if he was having trouble breathing and he said yes because his throat was closing and his whole arm was tingling. I had him take his mask down and try to take a few deep breaths first. I asked for permission to administer an Epi-pen which he gave verbal consent. 911 was called. Patient stated he did not want 911 called because he was going to refuse service.  After a min or so patient stated his throat was back open and he was feeling good. I informed him paramedics are on their way and he needed to stay in the waiting room because effects of the EpiPen can wear off in 15 min.  I stayed with him and watched until paramedics arrived. Paramedics sat with him and he did refuse service (they did take his blood pressure).  When paramedics asked the patient about when he came in they asked if he was having trouble breathing and he responded &#34;no I could breathe, my voice was just hoarse&#34; (which is the opposite of what he told the technician and myself). He also sounded like it was very hard to breathe. I did information to the paramedics after saying that he told us his throat was closing of which they stated that they figured that was the case and they knew the patient and assumed he would refuse service.   Patient was in contact with his primary care doctor who told him he could go home if his BP was ok but to make sure he had someone to drive him home.  Patient had his wife come to get him and they left.

                                                It has been 6 weeks since my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for Covid-19. For the first 3-4 days I had the usual moderate flu-like symptoms:  dizziness, headaches, fatigue, chills, soreness at vaccine siteetc.  Days 5-7 I seemed to gradually improve. On day 8 all of the symptoms returned with greater severity: this time I had a fever, the chills were much more intense, the headaches were excruciating, body and joint aches all over the place--I couldn&#39;t sleep or focus on anything cognitively taxing.  Interestingly, my brother, who was vaccinated just after me, also had more severe side effects beginning on day 8 post 2nd dose. He improved after 3-4 days, but my recovery has been much much lengthier. By day 14 I was still feeling very ill, though the fever did subside.  Sometime in the third week the pain in my arm at the vaccination site returned, then became intermittent, and still bothers me from time to time. I also started getting muscle spasms in the same exact locations that sent me to the ER after my probably bout with Covid in the spring of 2020. Thankfully these lasted only a week or so, though I began feeling muscle soreness in different parts of my body, ever changing. By the 4th week I was slightly better and down to 4 main symptoms: chills (by far the worst of the symptoms--to the point at which my skin would feel like it was being frostbitten by dry ice every time I changed sweaty clothes), occasional splitting headaches, and muscle soreness that included both the injection site on my arm and other areas.  I had other symptoms as well, fatigue and brain fog, etc, but these were present before the vaccination, though not as severe.

Starting on Wednesday, March 24 my tongue felt numb (dime size, center of tongue) - could not taste in that spot but rest of tongue was ok.  It progressively got worse - Saturday, March 27 and Sunday, March 28 felt foggy, more numbness on left side of face, specifically lip area.  On Monday, March 29 speech was slurred, numbness was worse.  Sent photos to neurologist due to concern for stroke and he said call my PCP and my PCP said to go to the ER.  Diagnosed with Bells Palsy.

                                                The differences started out with a sore arm that occurred the same day as my 2nd dose which occurred the next day after my 1st dose. The morning after my 2nd dose I awoke around 8AM to a 102.1 F temperature and then took 2 extra strength Tylenol (500mg) around 8:15 AM. I felt very groggy, tired, and still had the sore arm. I felt hot and cold spells over the next 6 hour time period. I measured my temperature around 12:30 PM and it was 99.5 F, and I later took another dose of 2 Tylenol (500mg) around 2:10 PM. I was still feeling groggy and tired but the hot and cold fluctuations seemed to be abated. Around 9PM I measured my temperature again and it had  risen to 101.5F, so I took a shower then took two 200mg Advil/Ibuprophen and went to bed around 9:45 Pm . I awoke around 1AM that same night (03/25/21) and was sweating profusely in bed but was too tired to get up. I laid back down and went back too sleep. I awoke that morning around 7:50 AM feeling very sore in my muscles but no additional symptoms. My temperature was measured at 98.3F and I felt back to my normal self. No additional symptoms have presented afterwards.

Then a day later, I started getting an itch in my throat followed by a deep cough. I had to order Azithromycin and Prednisone to kill whatever what was going on.  I was sick for 3 full weeks.   Alternatively,  my 76 father   passed away only hours after receiving his 2nd moderna vaccine. We share the same number and I have to enter his information also.

                                                Patient recieved the vaccine  in the left arm and was asked to wait in the pharamcy waiting area for observation for 15 minutes (no previous hx of anaphylaxis). Upon returning to the main pharmacy floor a few minutes later one of the technicians alerted me to the patient had retrurned to the counter and was &#34;feeling something&#34;. He was visibly struggling to maintain balance and I asked patient to take a seat to prevent any risk of falls and motioned to a chair. He took a seat on the floor  next to the pharmacy counter and I rushed over to him to tend to him. I asked him if was having any other symptoms and he noted he was feeling lightheaded and having chills all over his body. His body was cold and clammy to the touch and had a difficult time locatiing a pulse on the radial artery. While talking to him his responses were shorter and he seemed like was starting to almost lose conciousness. Management had already called 911 and we offered water to the patient while we waited. Prior to the paramedics arriving I was able to get a pulse using a cuff and it was around 53bpm, the patient also seemed hypotensive.

                                                On 4/8/21 awoke to intense pain in his left foot about 12 hours after receiving his 1st dose Moderna vaccine batch #038B21A. Over the next few days swelling and pain increased in the left foot moving around from the big toe, to ankle, to arch. His foot was swollen and extremely painful and he was not able to walk or put weight on the foot. On 4/18 he went to the clinic. The doctor took fluid from the big toe joint to test uric acid levels. Elevated levels of uric acid confirmed his condition to be Gout and Indomethacin was prescribed for pain and swelling. He has never had Gout or any kind of arthritis,  joint pain or foot injury prior to the Moderna vaccine. As of 4/13/21 he is still unable to walk or sleep well due to pain and swelling in the foot. He is not able to work or resume normal daily activities.

Treatment: Begin taking Zyrtec. 3/12: Itching, scratchy feeling spread to upper back. 3/12-3/15: Itching on back accompanied by tenderness, burning sensation like sunburn that spread to entire back, neck , head, and upper arms. Itching spread to legs, arms, groin, around eyes. Scratching raised occasional welts on legs and arms but didn&#39;t on back, just created more intense pruritus. Saw dermatologist 3/19 who recommended upping dose of antihistamine. Saw allergist 3/23 who gave similar direction. Treated with 1 Zyrtec twice a day until 4/12, then ceased because of excessive fatigue, and started treated with hydrocortisone OTC 3x/day. Outcome: Itching, burning, stinging sensation remains, especially on back, but also on neck and arms and legs.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

Caller was not receptive of recommendations as he does not want to pay money for a visit if they can&#39;t do anything and possibly be sent to Ortho and pay more money. He doesn&#39;t feel he should be responsible for anything.  Recommend increase ROM to left arm and hand as frequently as possible.

Once vaccinated patient seemed anxious so pharmacist continued to directly monitor the patient.  He proceeded to feel nauseous and lightheaded.  At this point, patient was laid on the floor on his side to prevent falls and 911 was called.  Patient lightheadedness continued along w/ perspiration, and cold extremities.  Cold compress was applied to patient&#39;s neck and face area.  We maintained conversation until EMS appeared in which he disclosed he had been fasting.  EMS proceeded to conduct patient well check and released patient --patient disclosed that this always happens when he receives shots or has blood drawn.

The left index figure and thumb started tingling and became numb. The pain is present in the front and back of the left shoulder as well. Saw a Dr and she told me to take 4 x 200mg Motrin every 6hrs for next 4-5 days. She also gave Tylenol 3. The pain was so acute that I asked my doctor to just chop off my arm. I couldn&#39;t sleep, I couldn&#39;t stand, sit or lay down. It hurt all the time. Lost all strength in the left hand and arm.  Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help with the pain. The swelling went down quite a bit in 3 days. Motrin caused a flare up of Crohn&#39;s.   Saw another Dr 5 days later. She prescribed gebapentin, flexrel, norco, toradol, etc. It&#39;s now been almost 20 days since the injection. The pain has subsided but not completely gone. I am still unable to do much work and it hurts just to sit! I still have pain and still do not have my strength back. I am still unable to go back to work.

I found him in the bathroom after he regained consciousness in a cold sweat, extremely pale, saying that he thought he was going to throw up.  He said it felt like food poisoning.  I got him back into bed with a cool wash cloth and he slept off and on the rest of the day.  He started feeling a bit better but struggled to comprehend simple questions and would just stare at me blankly as if he couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying.  Even though he slept most of the day he was falling asleep in his chair by about 8pm.  The paleness, waves of exhaustion, and inability to stay awake past 8:30/9pm has continued.

It got better after some stretching Ice and anti inflammatory I also noticed I could not press any weight over my head and my right scapula was winging then the pain came back about four days later. The pain was so bad I went to urgent care and was given muscle relaxers.  The pain went away after a couple days but after giving it several weeks to see if the winging and weakness in my arm went away.  When it didn&#39;t I contacted Orthopedics to have my arm looked at.  The PA and was seen by noticed the scapular winging and believes its due to damage of my long thoracic nerve.

                                                I had what I thought was &#34;normal&#34; pain at the injection site (left shoulder) initially however the pain spread from the injection site downward to my mid triceps by Saturday to Sunday afternoon. By Sunday night my shoulder mobility began to diminish (lifting the arm enough to comfortably shower was challenging). By Monday my shoulder and elbow radiated with pain originating at the injection site. By Monday afternoon I had lost virtually all mobility and strength in shoulder such that I could not raise my arm high enough to wash my left arm/hand enough to wash my hands in a kitchen sink/bathroom (which has NEVER been an issue). Since Monday, any activity that innervates the left shoulder to generate movement results in debilitating pain. By Tuesday the pain, immobility, and strengthless-ness had spread gradually to my left pectoral muscle, my left rear deltoids, my left elbow, my left forearm and slightly into my left pinky and ring fingers. Wednesday (today) all the symptoms from Tuesday are still present with the added symptom that maintaining proper posture through my left shoulder is also painful so now I&#39;m hunching on my left side.

                                                He got the vaccine, and when he woke up the 2nd day his throat felt dry and felt like it was sore.  His arm felt sore as if somebody hit him several times, very sore.  I felt sick, felt queasy, nauseous wanting to vomit but did not.  He felt really tired, fatigued because he didn&#39;t get any sleep that night.  He went all day feeling terrible, nauseous, felt like being through the ringer an flushed, which went on for 2-3 days.  He now feels a lot better, but felt like he was getting the flu.  He did not take anything for it and did take some medicine to help him sleep and did get a lot of rest and sleep.  He did drink a lot of liquids to keep his throat lubricated.  He also did have a throbbing headache, which he normally does not get headaches and felt terrible.  He did take some aspirin for that.  The symptoms have all resolved and feels perfectly fine now.     Stated that he has never felt so bad in his life.

Then on second day after taking the vaccine my left leg and lower back hurts. Since then, I am having left leg and back pain because of which I can&#39;t even stand. I have to lay down or sit all the time. When I stand, my left leg pain increases to extremely high level and starts feeling numbness on the feet.

                                                gave blood on April 8. On April 9, right above the blood draw area on my right arm, the muscle on my lower bicep started twitching. I looked up to see if loss of blood could cause it. This was about two weeks after my first dose of Moderna. I would occasionally get similar twitches on different areas of my body for the next week but didn&#39;t think too much of it. Upon my second vaccine on April 14, the twitches became much more frequent. Multiple times a day and more forceful in different areas of my body. Over the last weekend April 23, 24 and 25, the twitches were at their worst, occurring in my left arm, right shoulder, abdominal muscles, buttocks, thigh and calves at different times. Over the last several days, they have subsided somewhat and are occurring less forcefully and more sporadically. Today, only a few small twitches--similar to what it was prior to my second shot.

                                                Helicobacter pylori; arm pain; a little bit cold; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of HELICOBACTER INFECTION (Helicobacter pylori) in a 40-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 046B21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure abnormal. Concomitant products included AMLODIPINE for Hypertension.    On 09-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PAIN IN EXTREMITY (arm pain) and FEELING COLD (a little bit cold). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HELICOBACTER INFECTION (Helicobacter pylori) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, HELICOBACTER INFECTION (Helicobacter pylori), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (arm pain) and FEELING COLD (a little bit cold) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       For mRNA-1273, the report did not provide any causality assessment.  The patient was prescribed to take lansoprazole 30 milligrams, amoxicillin 500 milligrams, and clarithromycin 500 milligrams for 14 days to treat Helicobacter pylori.  Company comment: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I work at a Hospital sterilizing surgical equipment.  After I received the vaccine, the hospital staff observed me for 15 minutes to see if a reaction occurred.  I felt fine, and they told me I could go.  I was working that day (2-10:30pm) and had gotten vaccinated at the beginning of my shift.  The rest of my shift went fine.  Near the end, though, my arm began to feel sore.  Driving home, I began to feel tired.  By the time I got home, it felt like a cold was setting in.  I ate a large bowl of chicken soup to try to feel better.  I stayed up a little bit, but was feeling woozy by this point and went to bed.  Bad chills set in and I began to shake I felt so cold.  I used a heating pad to help with this.  I tried to sleep, but my head was throbbing.  The next morning, I tried to sit up in bed but my first attempt proved too difficult.  I took it slower.  I was able to sit up eventually.  Standing was also difficult.  I spent the day mostly lounging on the couch.  I slept a little better that night, but my head was still throbbing somewhat.  No chills this time.  Getting up the next morning went a little better.  I was able to sit up in bed without issue and walking around did not prove as much of a chore.

After observation for 4 hours I was feeling better, and was discharged home.   Ordered to take 40mg of steroids for 2 more days.  After one day post vaccination, I have significant pain at the site and body ache.

Then I rapidly spiked a 102.7 fever and became so physically weak I felt paralyzed. Oxygen saturation dropped into the low 90s and I began to have labored breathing. I made an attempt to stand up and urinate, then passed out and collapsed. Ems came to the house and checked me out. I declined their offer to go to the hospital because I broke the fever, was breathing better, and had no concussion signs from the fall.

Didn&#39;t think anything of it, Monday my right eye began to water like crazy. Didn&#39;t think anything of it. Tuesday morning I had a hard time eating breakfast because I couldn&#39;t open my mouth wide enough and was hitting my bottom lip with my teeth. i thought it was strange but didn&#39;t think anything of it. Took a shower about 11;30 and when I looked in the mirror I notice the ride side of my face was not responding like the left side, I called my doctors office and they got me right in. After a brief consultation they called ER and told me I would be on my way. I checked into ER at about 1;30pm.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

Went to work with little energy.

                                                Around 11:30 pm that evening I started feeling extremely warm in my face and thighs. Figuring it was due to the shot, I decide to try and lay down to sleep it off. A short time later, I awoke freezing with chills and uncontrollable shivering. My whole body hurt especially my lower back and pressure in my head. This continued throughout the night until the early morning. As the shivering and chills subsided, extreme fatigue, body aches and head pressure continued and it was difficult to get up at points. I had no appetite and forced myself to drink to stay hydrated.  About 1:00 pm, I started to feel better, but that was short lived. Approximately 4:30 ? 5pm, the chills and shivering returned and I had 101 fever. I had some tea and toast and then went to bed for the night. When I awoke this morning, I felt a million times better. As of writing this email, I still have some slight fatigue, aches, and head pressure, but night and day difference from yesterday.

Went to bed and woke up with night sweats, aches, chills, fever (persistently over 100F, topped at 101.3F) and one of the worst headaches I?ve ever had (not hyperbole, truly a monster headache). Slept for small stretches of time, maybe 45-60 mins, before waking. Condition worsened until about 6-7am. Chills persisted but worst symptom was the headache, it was inescapable pain. At 9am, took 400mg ibuprofen and was able to fall asleep.  Woke again around 10:30, soaking wet in sweat, but felt much better. Headache about 95% resolved, fever subsided (temp returned to steady 98.2).  Felt generally tired the rest of the day, but overall much better than the overnight period.

When I woke up at 5 Am I suffered from severe headache. Remainder of the day I had extreme digestive issues that continued over the next several days. At the conclusion of the second day I developed a fever of 101. Pinpointed severe pain developed at the base of my neck between my shoulder blades. That pain remained for approximately 24 to 48 hours that lead to extreme pain and stiff neck on my right side. Chills and periodic fever developed for two days past shot. By day three I had extreme right side neck pain that continued down into my right shoulder blade. By day four and five I suffered from extreme neck pain and severe headache that was focused from my right eye through my head down the right side of my neck to my right shoulder blade. By day 4 this continued with dizziness and blurred vision. I had inability to eat and strong feelings to vomit but only didn&#39;t because I hadn&#39;t consumed any food that day. I continued to suffer from extreme headaches and complete physical exhaustion with inability to stay away. In addition, I continued to have periodic chills but with no fever.  As I submit this in day 5 I still suffer from lack of energy and the stiff neck remains down through my right shoulder blade.

Being the stubborn person I am I didn?t go right away. 2/13/21 I went to the hospital.  I was diagnosed with Bell?s Paulsy.  The doctor did not seem to think I had an ear infection.  My entire left side of my face is paralyzed.  I still have pain behind my right ear and around the ear canal.  My vision in my left eye is terrible.   My speech is getting slurry.  2/16/21 I followed up with my primary doctor.  He is hoping with the treatment I&#39;m on this will go away in 1 to 2 weeks.  He encouraged me to fill this adverse reaction form out. I have a follow on 2/17/21 with and ophthalmologist for my blurred vision.

                                                I had severe aches and pains that started the night of the 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.   The aches kept me awake, I took 4 baths during the night attempting to shake the chilled feeling.   I did not vomit, but the best way I can describe the after effect was similar to a very bad flu.  The next day I was understandably tired, but also very weak.  I slept for somewhere in the neighborhood of 36 hours on and off starting halfway through the day after the vaccine was administered.  After about a 48 hour period since the vaccine, I started to feel better, but not fully recovered for a few days.

                                                Huge red rash that appeared about 8 hours after I got my second vaccination. It is painful to touch and itchy, and often feels like the skin is burning. The rash feel feverish. It started out smaller, but increased in size over the next few days. I received my second vaccination on 3/3/21 and I still have the rash today on 3/6/21. I have also had a very light fever that has come and gone, along with extreme fatigue and severe body aches.

                                                Delayed reaction occurred 8 hrs. after receiving vaccine. Felt as if I was injected with the Flu, based on the symptoms that arose: chills, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, fever, body aches, weakness, no appetite or desire to hydrate(every single symptom was severe) These symptoms lasted 12 hrs. I chose to go in to work, instead of taking the day off. I truly believe that because I pushed my body through this painful ordeal, it helped me to overcome this Flu-like feeling that I endured for 12 hours: 10 of those at my job. I also experienced a swelling &amp; pain in my right knee. The pain &amp; swelling is finally subsiding as I type this report 4 days after the vaccine.

                                                About 1 hour after injection I started feeling mild tingling in my face and throat. I then lost my voice for approximately 5 minutes. As the next few days started to progress I started noticing mild muscle spasms all over my body, mostly in my legs; waking up in the middle of the night, dry mouth, night sweat (1 occurrence), sudden onset of rapid and irregular heart beat (1 occurrence); kidney pain (right and left), upper abdominal pain (right and left). Prior to vaccine I did not experience any of these events.

On Saturday my arm was still sore so took some more Ibuprofen. Sunday I was feeling fine until about 8 pm when I started to get a little dizzy.  On Monday when I woke up I could barely raise my head. Everything was spinning. I was very dizzy and my mouth was dry. I had no concept of time. 2 mins would feel like 2 hours and 2 hour could feel like 2 mins. I started to feel a little better around 4 pm. Today I still feel a little hazy in the head.

                                                The night of January 9th around 2330 I noticed that the left side of my face was acting a little funny.  As the night progressed into the morning I noticed that it was starting to get worse and my face was drooping. By the evening of January 10th the left side of my face was really droopy. I had heard that a small percentage of the new COVID-19 vaccines had caused Bell&#39;s Palsy in a small percentage of the clinical trial patients. I did some research on Bell&#39;s Palsy and found what to do in the event of an onset. I took Advil 2 to 3 times a day  for about a week and kept a close eye on it to make sure that it wasn&#39;t getting any worse. After about 2.5 to 3 weeks the symptoms of the Bell&#39;s Palsy went away on its own. I did not see any physicians for treatment.

                                                Went to ED 3/30/21  Immediately after receiving the second vaccine 2/25 he developed chest tightness and joint pain. The chest tightness resolved within a few hours. He then had severe fatigue x36 hours-sleeping most of that time?followed by fever, chills, myalgias x2d. Those resolved but the arthralgias have persisted since then. Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain. The sacral sxs resolved w/in 1 week but the tingling in extremities has persisted.

Symptoms were a sharp pulsating pain in the back of the skull, left side, approximately every 30 seconds followed by a corresponding twitching sensation in the left eye/jaw.  Always possible it?s a coincidence / unlucky timing but woke me up and never experienced something like it - just reporting in case a pattern is later observed.  By 10 am (7 hrs post being awoken by it, seemed to subside but was still intense in severity in the early active/awoken hours)

                                                I?ve been vaccinated for 2 months now. My new symptoms just started to really ramp up 3 weeks ago. Of course I had the initial symptoms of being sick for 2 and 1/2 days after my second shot?.but recently it started with leg aches and then it matriculated up into my upper body. My legs have since become less achy per say. Now it?s my upper body and mostly in my shoulders (more in the one I received the shots in), back pain, and general fatigue. Currently still dealing with the upper body ache discomfort, cold hands and feet but I noticed that I have a slight headache always and my vision has became a little blurry in one eye. The headache severity is day to day but what?s interesting now is I?m having ear ringing and sensitivity to sound. Headache seems to emulate from the back of my skull and the crown of my head. The other lingering piece is the fatigue after doing activities. I?m an active guy and recently my body gets really achy after I do anything super strenuous and I get tired. Also feeling a little shaky, some rapid heart rate, and some circulation issues in my legs and arms. Note; never experienced these issues before the Vaccine aside from the normal wear and tear of an active lifestyle.

                                                An employee of the pharmacist (later told to me by the pharmacist to be an intern) injected me, my wife, and my father-in-law each with an expired Moderna vaccine dose, rather than the Johnson &amp; Johnson dose we had ordered (note: the Johnson &amp; Johnson dose and its lot number were written on our vaccination cards). Our vaccines were administered one after another by the same intern between 11:15am and 11:45am. We were unaware of the error until the pharmacist, called me after I had returned home and eaten lunch (around 12:40pm). The pharmacist explained that his intern had administered the Moderna doses from a stock that was supposed to be disposed of on 4/26/21, suggesting that the doses were expired. Unbelievably, those expired Moderna doses were apparently drawn from their vials into syringes on 4/26/21 and left, at room temperature, in a non-segregated area of the pharmacy, near the Johnson &amp; Johnson doses. My wife, father-in-law, and I were completely distraught and unsure of what would happen. Each of us called our primary care physicians, but the advice was unclear given the uncertainty. Our online searches of Moderna and related vaccine studies also revealed no information on what we could expect to occur from receiving expired doses. In my case, my arm was sore on 4/29 and 4/30, and on 4/30 I was extremely fatigued. My wife and father-in-law experienced similar symptoms, although my wife&#39;s were more severe.

                                                Friday after the shot was good, just a sore arm. On Saturday I developed a fever of 101 and chills and was very tired. I felt a little better on Saturday night and Sunday morning after some Tylenol 500 mg. My fever would break then come back for a bit  By Sunday afternoon my back began to really hurt. I have some chronic back pain so didn&#39;t think too much of it just tried to massage it and stretch it out. However it just kept getting worse and the pain radiated into my chest around 9:00 PM Sunday night.  It continued to get worse until about midnight, and I  ultimately decided to go to the ER.  The tylenol helped reduce the pain by the time I got into the ER but I went in anyway because I was concerned about the intensity of the chest pain I&#39;d had earlier.  I was tested for heart enzymes and they were slightly elevated, at .12.  On this result, I was admitted to the hospital on suspicion of having suffered a heart attack.  I was put on a heparin drip and my troponin levels were tested every 3 hours.  They continued to rise to a high of .67.  More testing was done, and the cardiology department concluded that I had not suffered a heart attack due to the low troponin levels but that instead I was dealing with heart inflammation.  Every doctor and nurse there commented that there had been other patients coming in with cardiac inflammation from vaccines as well.  Due to my family history of heart issues and my own existing risks, I was moved to the hospital where I was examined in the cath lab via angiogram.  This found no blockages in my arteries, further confirming the cardiology suspicion of cardiac inflammation, and I was given a diagnosis of pericarditis and prescribed colchicine to treat the inflammation.

Then I felt fine for about 12 hours after the shot (1st moderna shot on 1/21/21, 2nd moderna shot on 06/02/21). About 9:00 pm I had soreness in my arm and body aches. By 2 am on 6/3, the body aches were extreme, along with chills, and a low fever 99-100. The headache that followed lasted hours and was terrible. I had not been sick, or felt sick, in more than a year, and experienced only a sore arm with the first shot. The after affects from the second shot were terrible and I am afraid and anxious. I hope I don&#39;t die.

                                                On 4/26 around 4pm 2 Moderna vaccine doses were drawn up for immediate administration to patients with the evening appointments that day.  By 7pm the last 2 appointments did not show up. The pharmacist placed the 2 syringes in the fridge to report as waste the next day in inventory counts. This pharmacist did not work the next morning. On 4/28, the pharmacist working the afternoon shift thought the 2 drawn up syringes were from that morning and administered one to patient. Moderna manufacturer was contacted on 4/29 to advise on next steps and if re-vaccination was required. They advised that the reason for the 12 hour window after puncture of the vial is because it does not contain preservative and to avoid potential infection it should be disposed of after 12 hours, however the vaccine is viable for 30 days in the fridge at manufacturer?s temperature. The vaccine was within the 30-day window and remained in the fridge the entire time. The patient was called two times after their vaccination to check in for any adverse event or signs of infection. The patient reported only a sore arm for a few days, no signs of infection or other adverse reaction. The 1st dose was not re-administered. Pt was administered the 2nd vaccine on 5/26, 28 days later. The pharmacy updated their procedures for immediate vaccine disposal before leaving for the evening and other procedures such as clear labels and individual draws to avoid this same error. All staff were retrained.

No treatment was needed.    On January 1st I noticed tingling  in both of my legs.   Since then it has gotten worse.  I have tingling in both legs, muscle twitching throughout both legs intermittently, muscle weakness specifically after muscle use, an abnormal skin sensitivity when wearing pants, and a consistent ache throughout my legs.  The symptoms affect me 24 hours a day and create an anxiety that I have not felt before.  It has also adversely affected my sleep.

                                                Woke up at 2 am the morning after the injection with my arm extremely sore, swollen, red, and feverish to the touch that has continued for 4 days now. I also experienced a fever for 2 days after the injection along with dizziness, weakness, fatigue, headache, body aches, vision changes, and ringing in both ears. As of today 1/12/21 I am still experiencing symptoms even while using Benadryl allergy tablets by mouth and anti-itch cream applied to the injection site.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

                                                I received my first Covid-19 Moderna injection and felt slightly groggy and tired as the day progressed. Just before bed I noticed my arm was quite sore and I still felt tired and slightly light headed. The next day (Feb 4) I had a very sore left arm at the injection site but felt good otherwise. I came home from work and took one 200mg Ibuprofen as my arm was still quite sore. The following day (Feb 5) my arm pain subsided but I still felt light headed during the evening. I am writing this on Feb. 18th and each day I have bouts of being light headed and have difficulty concentrating. There is no real pattern to what time of day I get the symptoms. I do not have the classic headache but definitely feel pressure in my head and behind my eyes. I also find that I wake up after a full nights sleep and feel not well rested. I spoke with my doctor last week and he suggested I give it until this week to see where things are at. I plan on contacting him soon to schedule an appointment to discuss my symptoms more. Before getting the vaccine I did not have any of these symptoms as I describe.

I had intended to go back to work but instead my supervisor insisted on me being evaluated. It was determined that I was hypertensive. I felt a bit off and a bit strange. Even after lying on a bed in a dark room hypertension continued. I was transported by ambulance to the local emergency department where my BP continued to run high. The next day I was in bed the whole day feeling as if I had Covid all over again. I did previously had Covid but waited over 30 days to receive the vaccination.

                                                I was driving on the highway and experienced numbness starting in my lips.  This numbness then moved throughout my body into my limbs.  I had some mobility and was able to pull off of the highway down an exit but at one point, I could not lift my legs or control my hands.  I called 911 but it was very difficult to do so with the numbness.  I then started to regain my mobility but had some continued numbness around the left side of my mouth.  The paramedics tested my vitals and everything came back as normal.    They recommended that I have someone come pick me up. So I had a neighbor come pick me up and someone drive my car home.  I did not lose any vision or mental capacity throughout this.  It was just a wave of numbness throughout my entire body.  It lasted 5-10 minutes but felt like an eternity. I am lucky to be alive and to not have crashed my vehicle into someone or something.

On way home my lips started to tingle a bit and I felt warmer over my body. I got home and felt exhausted for multiple days but on the first day I could not sleep. By the weekend I was just worn out and slept all day the following Sat and Sunday.  My arm hurt so bad I couldn?t lay on it and I even  today either have phantom arm pain or real arm pain. But I know where the shot was because I feel it. It still feels like a deep tissue bruise.

It was a bright red spot in my cornea and both my eyes were sore.   Since then, the hemorrhage has spread within my right eye. My eyes are still sore and I get a sharp/shooting pain in my right eye intermittently. I also feel some soreness in my right temple and under the ear.

When I woke up March 31 my entire right side of my face was dropping and was not responsive to facial motion. Went to the ER to get checked out. They did testing to make sure to rule out a stroke. And found it to be Bell?s Palsy. I was given a prescription of steroids ,  antibiotic, and eye ointment. I was told to go for a follow up with my Family doctor. I have that scheduled for April 5th at 3:15pm with Dr.. I have had to miss two days of work so far due to this adverse side effect.

By 2 p.m. my partner noticed I was very warm and took my temperature. I had a 100.1 degree fever. So I took a single adult dose of Tylenol, napped for a few hours, and I felt much better afterwards. I didn&#39;t need any further doses because by late evening, all symptoms (except the mild arm soreness) were nearly gone.

He did a stroke test as he is a EMT, then 20 minutes later  when he went to take a drink of something he noticed his facial droop on the left side.  Saturday he went to the ER and was put on PRednisone, and Valcyclovir.  Had follow up today with a provider and the medication has not improved anything.

I contributed it to just being sore like the literature had sad. When I received my second dose within 20 minutes my arm was extremely sore. It got to the point where I could not lift my arm at all and had no ROM in it at all. It was like my arm just was not working and I would have to move my arm around with my right arm. I was taking 600-800 mg of Motrin every 6 hours and alternating Tylenol 1000 mg and it was not easing the pain. It got to the point where the pain was so unbearable that I went to the Emergency Room on 4/3 where I was diagnosed with Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA). The gave me some Toradol and Decadron IM and sent me home with Naproxen and Prednisone with orders to follow up with my PCP

                                                Wednesday night after gettting the shot, I started getting soreness in my left arm, and both shoulders and neck.  It felt like I had been in a car wreck as I was very sore and by bones had been jarred.  It went away almost exactly 24 hours after the shot around 1:30 pm on Thursday, and I felt fine until Saturday evening around 8:00 pm.  At 8:00 pm, I felt the sudden wave of heat rolling through my entire body.  It felt the same as I have had in the past when experiencing the flu.  My temperature rose and my whole body started to ache, and every moment that went by it got worse.  Around midnight my temperature was 103 degrees and I couldn?t stop writing in pain due to non stop body aches and fever.  At 9 am Sunday, my temperature had fallen to 100 and body aches subsided to only minor, but my headache was massive, and this lasted 3 days.

I had pain in my right arm, it was a fiery electrical pain that radiated from my right shoulder down to my right hand. The joints in my hands particularly my right index finger, ring finger and thumb felt incredibly painful. I could not pick up or grasp anything. It felt like I had intense rheumatoid arthritis and my symptoms lasted about 5-6 days before they started to go away.

Very sore arm at injection site.

                                                42 y/o F with a history of uterine prolapse, GERD who is presenting with low back pain x4-5 days, about 2 weeks after receiving the Moderna vaccine on 3/28; she also developed a raised patchy erythematous rash on her L deltoid (site of vaccine injection) a few days prior to onset of the pain.  Symptoms began Saturday, 4/10; pt was helping her mother around her house; was not straining excessively; however, later that day had a sudden burning sensation in her lower-mid back, which has since been recurring in paroxysms.  At times it spreads into the posterior thighs but not into the feet; sometimes also spreads upward into the upper back and just below the chin.  In between attacks, there is no pain or numbness.  There has never been weakness. No urinary/bowel incontinence or saddle anesthesia; sphincter tone was normal.  NIF/FVC normal -60, 2.3L.  Paroxysmal pain controlled w/ 600mg gabapentin q8h since being hospitalized.  There has been no development or progression or symptoms, still only pain and normal neurologic and physical exam.

                                                On 4/22/21, approximately 1 hr after the Moderna COVID-19 first vaccination injection, I started to encounter allergic reactions that I used to suffer about 20 years ago. My air intake decreased, and my skin began to become irritated. I formerly had environmental allergies that would reduce my air intake, and the first place I noticed the effects were on my skin and I would become irritable. Physicians told me that when my oxygen levels were low, the body would channel the air to where it was most needed, which is generally not the skin, so my skin would become irritated. When this used to occur, I would respond involuntarily with facial twitches and pulling at my face and hair. Physicians explained that these twitches and pulling actions would draw air to the surface of my skin where I was air depleted. When I took the Moderna injection, this happened again -- I found myself with low air, my face was twitching, and I was pulling on my face to draw air to the area. The result when I was 19 and dealing with allergies is that I would remove small patches of hair from my head or eyebrows or eyelashes, and this would happen almost unconsciously as I tried to stimulate the areas and draw air to the surface of my skin. I did the same thing on 4/22/21, and found later, when looking into a mirror, that I had removed a section of my eyebrow unconsciously. It all comes back to oxygen depletion. A different and more intense event occurred in the night of Friday, 4/23/21, and the early morning of Saturday, 4/24/21. I went to bed at about 11 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. Between that time and approximately 1:30 a.m., I had difficulty sleeping, and I dreamed of pain in my chest. I finally woke up about 1:30 a.m. and found the pain in my chest was real. I was having difficulty breathing deeply. It felt as if  the lower part of my lungs (at least on one side) was solidifying or inaccessible. What I did was begin forcing myself to breathe as deeply as possible. Over a period of 30 minutes or longer, I was able to gradually reclaim the use of the deepest part of my longs. With every forced deep breath, I was able to chip away at the area that felt like it was freezing up. Finally, I felt that I could access the deepest part of my longs and breath normally. The pain and lack of use in my lower lungs were very concerning.

                                                Shingles.  Symptoms began 3 days after 2nd Moderna COVID vaccine. These included waves of chills sensation through left leg and groin lymph node areas, as well as fatigue, achiness, and general flu-like symptoms. 6 days later (5/9), the first sign of rash/blister broke out.   My doctor performed a house visit to confirm shingles and prescribed ValACYclovir. I am on my 2nd day of this medication.

My best estimate as the fast heartbeat last for between 60-120 seconds. I experienced the tingling feeling one more time, about 15 minutes later.

                                                Day after the vaccine I awoke with a very sore left arm which was to be expected.  Upon moving I experienced vertigo, dizziness, headache, and extreme pressure in the left side of my face to include sinus cavities and deep inner ear pressure.  I had some episodes of loose stools, not diarrhea, but not formed stools.  These symptoms still persist to today, 1/15/2021, except for loose stool, that has returned to normal.  I had a Dr. appointment today and the doctor would not rule out post vaccine side effects. I was tested for COVID on 1/11/2021 as a precautionary measure as I was displaying symptoms, but the test result was COVID not detected.

The following two days my arm was sore at the injection site but that went away in a couple days.  3 days post vaccination, my right axilla and median and ulnar nerves were extremely sensitive for 3 days but that subsided.  6 days post vaccine I started to get extreme fatigued, low energy and feel like my nerves were hot.  I got a covid test which was negative because I was not feeling well.  Then 9 days post vaccine I started to feel very fatigued, achey, and I couldn?t sleep well and like my nerves were burning up all over my body.  I had to call out of work due to brain fog, fatigue, nerve heat, difficulty concentrating.  I took my temperature during all this and it was 97.7.  My hands felt very hot and I could wash them under warm water because the water felt way too hot.

                                                On the day of the vaccination, I only had a little sore arm. But when I woke up the next day, around 4:30 am, I had a fever. I felt very cold and tried to sleep, but I could not fall asleep because of body aches and fever. So, I tried to get up and sit, but I could not and had to go back to bed with the pains and lethargy. I lied on the bed until around 8 am and realized that my fever was high. I took the temperature with my digital thermometer. It showed 108.7F. I could not believe it and retook it on my ears; it still showed 108.6F. My headache was really bad. So, I took 500mg Tylenol. The fever did not go away completely, and I had to keep sleeping the whole day. In the evening, before I went to bed, I took another 500 mg Tylenol and slept. I could not sleep well with the body aches. The next morning I still had 103F temp that slowly waned by the evening that day. Now I am feeling okay but have been struggling with a sleep problem.

The big change from dose 1 to 2 is muscle twitching.  The twitches coincide with the more extreme joint aches.  Sore arm  All started about 9 hours after vaccine. Sore arm was mitigated with movement and stretching (as compared to the first dose). Other symptoms have lessened since 7am (19 hours after shot), but linger.  Ibuprofen seems to lessen, but not end eymptoms.

                                                Joint Pain, initially started primarily in pinky knuckle on Day 2 and each day progressed to additional knuckles on right hand until I could not make a fist at 4th day. Progressed to left hand and other joints (knees) by 4th day. Use of acetaminophen helped alleviate  pain and permitted more movement.   By day 6,  pain  reduced to no longer need medication. As of Today,  joints are still not back to normal still slightly tight. Injection site was sore for 5 days.

Brain fog became concern at 8 pm. Mild Difficulty navigating grocery store.  Extreme soreness has withstood 3 ibuprofen (x2 doses) and today took 1 hydrocodine in cabinet.  Brain fog has continued and not improved. Moderate forgetting.   Definitely not able to work today (Sunday) and doubt I will be able to work tomorrow. I am private practice dr. and will probably loose substantial income tomorrow. Completely NOT worth it and concerning with the brain fog. I strongly regret the second shot.  No symptoms after 1st shot.  The dose should be immediately reduced for 2nd shot. This strong of an immune response is not necessary.

                                                My brother has epilepsy. His seizures can be triggered by low grade fever and exhaustion. He had covid in early October. His seizures are generally well controlled but he had several after the vaccine. I understand that the vaccine did not cause the seizures. The fever caused the seizure. I just think it?s important to neurologists to have this info to see how we can go about mitigating the seizures and if the 2nd dose is necessary. Keeping him hydrated may have helped and also giving him something immediately for the low grade fever. Just knowing these things may help others.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

                                                After an hour of  receiving the moderna covid-19 vaccine on February 20th my left arm started burning, The burning sensation hasn&#39;t stopped since I got the first dose. In fact it has gotten worse, now my arm feels week, my fingers tingle and the burning sensation radiates to my neck and left ear.  I been to the emergency room, VA clinic, and local clinic and nobody has helped me. Everyone just tells me to take ibuprofen, Tylenol, naproxen, use hot and cold compressions. Nothing has helped, If someone can call me and help me I will really appreciated.

Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

                                                I&#39;ve lost 16 pounds in 1 month and 20 days without trying.  Moderna killed my obsession for food.  I was 268 lbs when I presented for the 1st dose of Moderna at the Robeson CRV.  Within 24 hours I was weak, cold, aching all over, and nauseous. The nausea moved over to lack of interest in food.     I&#39;ve struggled with intense craving for food non-stop for 30 years.  The cravings are gone.  By my second shot in March I was down to around 260 lbs.  Twenty days after my second shot, I am down to 252lbs.  Food is more of a necessity now rather than a constant desire.  I believe the vaccine modulated insulin/ghrelin or crossed the blood brain barrier and modulated the incessant dopamine reward signaling in the mesolimbic DA pathway when I eat food.  I reach satiety easily now.  I also have diminished need for Ativan.  I use to drink close to a gallon of water a day.  Now I have no real interest.  I might drink a couple liters a day.  To put things in perspective, before Moderna, I could eat 2 foot long Subway sandwiches, 3-6 cookies, 2-4 32 oz of soda and chips to stop my hunger for 2-3 hours.  2-3 hours later I would feel extremely hungry with a growling stomach. I could then consume 2-3 double cheeseburgers, a 20 piece nugget, 2 parfaits, and a chocolate sundae.  After Moderna, now a half a Subway sandwich and maybe a cookie are enough to last for most of the day.  The desire for food has diminished to necessity to eat and lack of interest in eating, even when my stomach is empty.  If I have a soda or sparkling water, I might have 1 or 2 and stop.  Moderna flipped some hormonal switch in my body.  It&#39;s great.  Food went from being an insatiable desire to a basic necessity.  I&#39;ve lost 16 pounds in 1 month and 20 days without trying.

The next thing I knew I was laying on the floor with a shirt in my hand but don&#39;t remember how I got on the floor or if I even fell.  I asked my Girlfriend if she had heard me fall, She said no. I walked into the bedroom and layed back down on the bed still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;. after what felt like a few minutes, I began Heaving like I was going to throw up but I felt like it was a dream and was very slow to react until my girlfriend told me to run to the bathroom. the whole time I was coughing up a foam.

Lasted throughout the day. on the second day after the shot around noon, started to have a pins and needles sensation in my ear and nose. Over the course of 2 hours, that sensation would stop and move to a different part of my body (fingers, arms, toes, back, hamstring, calves, etc). it would last for a while and show up elsewhere.  Went to ER after it persisted for 2 hours. Total event lasted about 4 hours. On third day, woke up with slight tingling in toes but after moving around for a few minutes, that sensation went away. At the time of this report, i feel no tingling and no fatigue. Note: i marked unknown to whether i have recovered from averse event as the ER doctor told me this could come back over the next few days and that we needed to let the vaccination process run through its course.

Stated that they rash was itchy, but not painful. They said they noticed the rash 3/30/2021, the day after their vaccination. This was reported to us over the phone, so was not able to see the rash in person. It was difficult to tell based on the description if it was related to the vaccine or not. Asked the patient if they were having any other issues/symptoms related to the vaccine. The patient stated other than a sore arm no. The patient was instructed that benadryl could be used to help with the itching, and that it was important that got in to a doctor as soon as possible to get the rash looked at.

Upon instruction by Firefighters patient stood up straight and noted no signs of dizziness. Firefighters did note some swelling of the tongue and patient insisted on being evaluated at the Hospital.

                                                Two nights in a row, 04/07 and 04/08, woke up with rapid heart rate (fluctuating from 85-110 bpm) and felt dizzy, fatigued, feverish, sweaty, shaky and about to pass out. Could have been hyperventilating in sleep because of rapid heart rate. Required about 2 hours of attention to reading, yoga and relaxation to get to sleep. On morning of 04/08, heart rate was still high (78-95) for resting, which is usually in the 50s or 60s. GI disturbance led to frequent bowel movements and the whole condition resulted in malaise and feeling of impending doom. A feedback from acute anxiety as a result of symptoms could be involved. Also involved is the diphenhydramine I took at 9 pm on 04/07 to treat hay fever and acute insomnia. Night if 04/08 was more manageable. But it interrupted sleep with strong disturbances that felt like spasms in prefrontal cortex coming out of sleep. More likely it was movement in sinus congestion that triggered a startle response while exhausted from work. It was bad timing to have the shot during a very busy work week.

All of a sudden, after about 5 minutes, I felt a rush go through my body and managed to declare &#34;I&#39;m not feeling well&#34; before I lost coherence and clarity. My wife called for help from the attendants as I started to convulse, get dizzy, start sweating, and feel like I was going to pass out. I then proceeded to throw up a couple of times and had to lie back for 30 minutes before switching to the passenger side of the vehicle for the ride home. I was completely worn out and weak, with flu-like symptoms and nausea for the rest of the day and for several days afterward.

At around 9:00 AM on Saturday 4/3/2021, I was awakened by intense pain and pressure that felt like the worst heartburn I&#39;d ever experienced. After OTC heartburn treatments didn&#39;t help, at around 11:00 AM I went to the local ER where I was initially diagnosed as having a heart attack. After being given some baby aspirin and a nitro tablet, I started feeling better and was airlifted immediately to a nearby cardiology unit at another hospital. A heart catheterization and EKGs determined that I had not had a heart attack, but instead had takotsubo cardiomyopathy. I was admitted into the cardiac ICU overnight for observation, transferred to a non-critical room the next day (4/4/2021), and released on Monday 4/5/2021.

                                                Today afternoon/evening I started to get sore and have a headache (which is normal from what I hear.) I could only sleep a couple hours Tuesday night into Wednesday morning because I kept tossing and turning. When I woke up Wednesday morning (4-21-21) around 6:00 am, I couldn&#39;t move as I normally could and when I tried to walk I found it very painful. The whole area between my knees and my shoulders were completely numb yet it felt as if it were on fire. I slept most of the morning and a little in the afternoon as it was very painful to move, talk, laugh, etc... Finally in the late afternoon (3:00-4:00ish) the numbness wore off but the burning sensation persisted. I felt progressively better throughout Thursday (4-22-21) and about the same time in the afternoon (3:00-4:00ish) the burning wore off as well. That evening I felt perfectly normal except for the typical achiness that tends to occur with  vaccines. Today (Friday 4-23-21) I feel rested and back to my normal self.

                                                Patient experienced left neuralgic amyotrophy.  He got the 1st dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday 1/28/2021. He got the 2nd Moderna shot on 2/26/2021. Symptoms started on 2/1/2021. That morning, he awoke with severe localized left shoulder/shoulder blade pain. No weakness or numbness at that time. Left shoulder pain lasted for a week then resolved on 2/7/2021. However, that same day that the left shoulder pain resolved, he started to experience constant tingling paresthesias at the left digits 4-5 and the medial palm/hypothenar eminence. He was recommended physical therapy and went there for 2 weeks then went to occupational therapy who noticed some left hand weakness. He does notice some mild difficulty manipulating left digit 5. Since then, symptoms are present but  improving.

Lots and lots of liquids from day 1; day 4 started taking minimal acetaminophen to ease pain and feelings of fever. Temperature never went above 96degrees.  Small portioned meals to get nutrients, and constant liquids to stay hydrated. This did not relieve any symptoms, until night 7 when pain started to subside. Constant stretching now to release the constricting of all my muscles and tendons over the course of side effects. Still constipated and slight nausea, still weak in strength.

The following Monday (72 hours) I woke up with &#34;the spins&#34; and a mild headache.  These symptoms have come and gone for over two weeks now.  One day it will be better, the next worse, then even worse, then recovery, then almost gone, back to spins and dizziness.  I read somewhere it may be cykotines affecting my inner ear.  I also have a mildly stuffed nose but nothing out of the ordinary.  This stuffiness is allergies (seasonal?) related perhaps.  Today (4/29) it went back to &#34;worse&#34;

                                                About 12 hours AFTER receiving my second dose, I&#39;ve had a non-stop fever that continued for about 24 hours, with temperatures ranging between 99.8 and 102 degrees. I haven&#39;t had a fever for more than a year, and I haven&#39;t felt that bad in a long while. There was a little headache as well, which has continued into the third day (which is today), but I do not have the fever anymore. I have had used 5 Tylenol in about 30 hours, and not sure if I will need one for the current headache. Also, the second dose left the pain in my arm for much longer compared to the first, but that was nothing compared to the problem with the non-stop fever, which is the adverse effect I am mostly concerned about.

                                                30 minutes after the shot I started to feel numbnes and hot on left of my face and ear.  It didn&#39;t really worried me at that time because I thought it is normal and it will go away. It didn&#39;t go away and I felt hotness around my face ear, and my hearing in my right ear was slighly worse, including some pain in the ear. First time I contacted my family doctor 4 days later when the symptoms got worse. My dr told me to use Ibuprofen 600 3 times a day for 3 days. After I didn&#39;t see any improvement I scheduled the appointment and saw my doctor 8 days after the vaccination. My doctor said my ear is clear and there was no infection and she gave me different antinflamatory medicine to take it for a week tis time. She didn&#39;t think that was from  the vaccine though. After a week It seems that I felt better but still not completely recovered. I stopped taking this medication after a week as descibed. the sympthomcame back and now I&#39;m 16 days after the shot and 6 day before the second dose and I&#39;m scared what to do.

He was taking Advil and Tylenol to assist with symptom managment.  Left arm and neck pain persisted.  On the morning of 5/11/21 he awoke with central chest tightness, left arm/shoulder/neck achiness, nausea and headache. During ride to hospital, he had palpitations for 30 minutes.  He arrived at  Medical Center where he was found to have a positive troponin I of 4.2 (ULN of &lt;0.045).  Echo done at that time showed EF of 59% with basal inferior, anterolateral hyokinesia, basal inferolateral hyokinesia, mid inferolateral hyokinesia, diastolic LV function normal function for age and trace mitral regurgitation.  ECG showed non diagnostic ST elevations in leads II, III, AVF.  The patient was transferred to another Medical Center  for urgent cardiac cath based on resting chest, arm and neck pain, positive troponin and wall motion abnormalities seen on echo.  Cardiac cath found normal coronary arteries that were free of disease.  Troponin I at this medical center was positive 0.31 and 0.39.  Further testing ordered is a cardiac MRI to assess for possible acute myocarditis.

                                                Sunday morning (2 days after vaccine) slight pain on right palm led to discovery of swollen palm (one-third of the palm). Swelling has persisted until date of reporting. Contacted Moderna who took down information and issued a case number.  Moderna stated someone from their company may or may not contact me. Indefinite as to the resolution.

                                                25 April - body aches and chills, no fever, these symptoms lasted for about 36 hours followed by general soreness throughout my entire body; 1 May - I woke up in the morning and was unable to urinate, I went to the ER and was given a catheter and sent home, I kept the catheter in place until Friday, 7 May when a urologist at hospital removed the catheter.  I was able to urinate over the weekend but the symptoms returned 10 May.  I returned to the urology clinic at hospital and I was given another catheter with instructions to follow up and conduct a hydroanalysis study with the urology clinic; Tuesday 11 May - I woke up with numbness and tingling in my hands, abdomen, and feet and pain throughout my entire body, scratching my chest made a burning sensation.  I went to the ER and was admitted to the Neurology department at the same hospital.  I stayed there for three nights and started to improve after receiving three daily doses of steroids, two days of IV steroids (1gram each), and one day of oral steroids (1 gram).  I was discharged on Friday, 14 May and still had significant pain throughout my body and numbness and tingling in my feet, hands, and torso.  I began to improve around 18 May with pain fading and numbness and tingling decreasing.  As of 2 June, I still have some numbness and tingling in my hands, feet, and abdomen.  It seems to slowly improve but not as quickly as it was in the aftermath of the high-dose steroids.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

                                                Severe Headache within 1 hour of vaccination (01/20/21 @1330hours), followed by a slight fever within 6 hours and fatigue. Overnight, I experienced severe chills and body aches, and severe fatigue, which followed the rest of the morning (01/21/21) with general discomfort. By that early afternoon the chills subsided, and I continued to feel body aches with minimal joint pain. By 4 pm, I began to develop an itchy rash on my left wrist under my wristwatch, left hand and on my right forearm. I experience fatigue throughout the rest of the day. I used over the counter Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Cream to alleviate the itch.  On the Morning of 01/22/23, I woke up to a itchy rash over my torso and my hands. I continued to apply the cream and I took an OTC Benadryl allergy pill, which seems to subside the rash.  On 01/23/21, I woke up the the same  rash over my feet and overall, the rash over my torso and hands had substantially subsided.

I woke up in the middle of the night with a fever, major chills, and a strong headache. I spent all of today dealing with what feels like the flu and that I was punched in my arm all the way to the bone.    I think it is getting a little better but right now I?m lying in bed in the dark with a winter coat.

Over the weekend I then thought I was developing acne (which is strange because I don&#39;t get acne).  By Monday it was getting terrible on the left side of my face and by bedtime I thought it was shingles.  I went to my general practitioner on Tuesday 2/2 and was diagnosed with shingles and prescribed Famciclovir 500 mg 3 x daily for 7 days.

                                                Patient arrived to ED via ambulance Patient is a 44-year-old male who presents to the emergency department for evaluation of an allergic reaction.  Patient reports that he is in EMS paramedic and that he had received his second dose of the COVID-19 Materna vaccine today at approximately 10 AM.  Since noon he noticed that he felt his ears tingling and that his skin became beet red and he broke out in hives.  He has a history of recurrent allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.  He went back to his EMS facility.  He noted that it was starting to get worse and so he was given IV with Benadryl and a dose of epinephrine and transported to the emergency department.  He still complains of itchiness and redness to his skin but says he feels better.  He denied having any tongue swelling or lip swelling or shortness of breath or wheezing or abdominal pain or diarrhea. In the ED he also received dexamethasone 10mg IV and 1L IV 0.9% sodium chloride

Mild (typical) post vaccination pain at injection site about 8 ot 9 hours after administration. Went to sleep without any systemic symptoms and woke up about 12 hours after administration with fever and chills. Temp approximately 101.5 at this point and chills body aches were moderate. Then woke up another 4 hrs later with severe headache, chills, weakness, joint and muscle pain and high fever(104.5). Symptoms have all begun to gradually improve, but still febrile with all other symptoms not being moderate and not severe, 26 hrs post vaccine administration.

These symptoms began 3 days after receiving the first Moderna COVID-19 vaccine of the two-part series. The pain is refractory to acetaminophen and three sessions of physical therapy. The pain and numbness make it difficult for the patient to fall asleep. The b/l leg pain was so disturbing that the patient presented to the ED where she was noted to be ?slightly ataxic? and was treated by the ER physician for lumbar radiculopathy with one Norco that did not help.

                                                5 days after injection I noticed a hive on my stomach.  The hives spread to additional areas of body over the next 24 hours including the face, scalp, neck, arms, back, and additional hives on chest.  This morning the majority are focused on my head and face area.  I&#39;ve double checked everything and haven&#39;t eaten or been in contact with anything out of the ordinary.    Also want to point out I had Covid in October 2020.  Also, I had a very sore arms for 2 days after shot along with exhaustion the 2nd day and a fever/chills (103 degrees) on my second night after injection.

We propped his feet up and gave supportive care such as blanket and ice packs.  Patients heart rate went back to normal (75-80 bpm) after 10 minutes.  However, 35 minutes post vaccination, pt started having chills and shakes.  Gave blanket and monitored patient for 45 min after vaccination.  Pt declined 911.  Wife took patient home 50 min past vaccination stating she felt he was stable and they would monitor at home.

No issues with breathing (even while wearing a mask).  Reaction started with blurred vision while reading (during the waiting period at the vaccination clinic). Started within 10 minutes of receiving vaccine.  Then the throat heaviness started, nose became numb, and lips were somewhat numb.  It occurred in waves, with a few minutes of symptoms, then a mild relief of symptoms (but not total relief), then symptoms returned. This continued for 30-45 minutes.   Received water and 2 Benadryl at the vaccination clinic from RN. Benadryl didn&#39;t seem to have any impact on symptoms.

I was out for a minute or two and when I was conscious again my vision was blurry and I felt very drunk for the next 45mins - hour. I also felt like I could taste the chemicals from the vaccine when I became conscious again.  The drunk/vertigo feeling subsided slowly over time but I was given a Benadryl from the pharmacist so I?m not sure when the dizziness stopped but I definitely could not drive home. My fainting was not due to any anxiety due to having a shot or anything, I was perfectly fine for approx 10-15 mins after the vaccine then I felt a cold feeling coming on from my right shoulder then up my neck then I got foggy and dizzy and passed out

A year earlier (Jan 2020) I was a bone marrow donor that required a heavy course of Filgrastim in preparation for the donation. As expected, the Filgrastim made me feel sick with a lot of bone soreness and pain, especially in my hips and legs. It lasted a few days after the donation and then was gone. Upon getting my second shot of the Moderna vaccine, the second day brought back the exactly soreness/pain that I felt under the filgrastim with distinct bone pain, especially in my legs/hips.

                                                had pain in left arm at injection site, but expected that. got sick after second dose (which is strange as I got really sick after the first one), that went away after roughly 36 hrs, however the injection site pain had radiated down the left arm. still, just assumed it&#39;d go away, no worries. woke up the second day after shot, with feeling as if id maybe slept funny, as my shoulder on the left arm had a shooting pain thru to my arm, which was numb and tingly, and my hand felt like it was asleep...total pins and needles. shook it, didnt go away. mind you, I&#39;m not a guy who thinks he&#39;s sick all the time, and is constantly at the doctor. I actually don&#39;t have a doctor, nor insurance, but I just usually ride whatever out..but this was becoming more than an annoyance. now its been three weeks or so, and the symptoms have just gotten worse. I&#39;d say I&#39;ve lost about 90% of the strength in my left hand. I can&#39;t make a fist, hold objects, pull up my pants, pick my nose, play my guitar, etc..my hand is never not buzzing with pins and needles, in a semi-claw shape, and its losing circulation as its noticeably purplish. yesterday, I called the urgent care that I use as a doctor if absolutely necessary, as I felt I had to do something. I asked if I could come down, described my symptoms, and they said all they&#39;d do is tell me to go to the ER as it sounded not good..now numbness is going down my left leg and foot is swelling.

                                                Initially, the patient had dizziness, lightheadedness and a syncopal episode within 5 minutes of the vaccine. He returned to normal fairly quickly and went home by report. He presented to the ER shortly after with palpitations and shortness of breath and required a dose of IM epinephrine. Patient since had intermittent fatigue, dizziness, blurred and vision changes as well as tinnitus. On May 31, 2021, patient presented to the ER with headache, lethargy, weakness, diaphoresis and dizziness. Additionally, noted to have slurred speech by his wife. MRI of the brain done at 4 am on 5/31/21 showed  the following  &#34;1. Acute bilateral cerebellar infarcts are seen with a right posterior 4.3  mm focus a left middle cerebellar peduncle 3.2 mm focus and a left superior cerebellar 7.9 mm linear focus. 2. Occlusion of the left vertebral artery extending into the basilar artery with reconstitution of the basilar artery via bilateral posterior communicating arteries. Findings are concerning for acute dissection occlusion. Consider further evaluation with MRA head and neck. 3. Question subtle area of restricted diffusion seen within the left dorsal medulla better appreciated on the maps measuring approximately 4.9 mm. Left lateral pontine 7.3 mm focus of restricted diffusion versus  artifact. These infarcts are not definite and could be artifactual asymmetry.&#39;. He required admission, heparin drip and neurology consult at that time, as well as permissive hypertension. shortly after 1 pm on May 31, he developed chest pain with ischemic changes on EKG requiring cardiology consult with possible intervention, though this was being coordinated with interventional neurology, as he also required basilar angiogram for his MRI findings. as cardiology and interventional neurology were coordinating taking patient for intervention, he became further unresponsive, though maintained his pulse, and required intubation and transfer to ICU, as well as repeat CT of the head to evaluate for continued thrombosis of his basilar system.

                                                He got his vaccine, the only thing that really hurt was that it felt like somebody shot him in the arm which lasted for a week.  Then on Sunday he has had what he thought was a heat rash, and went and did laundry and when they dropped him off he has realized that he has a rash that has multiple little spots on his arms and legs, and they fester like a heat rash, and feels like somebody is pinching his skin with  plyers.  On his chest/torso he has the rash that is sensitive to the point that it bothers something rubbing against it.  When they fester up he squeezes them to get rid of the pain and it&#39;s painful.  He also has a dry skin rash on his right butt cheek, which also started when this started as well.   He has not taken anything for this reaction.  He called the pharmacist and they told him to call us and report it.   The area of the shot looks like a state map shape rash area on his shoulder.

ON MONDAY, 3 MAY 2021, I VISITED MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH MY SKIN AND HE WONDERED IF I HAD STEPPED IN POISON IVY OR POISON OAK. I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT I HAD NOT BEEN HIKING AND THAT WE DO NOT HAVE POISON IVY OR POISON OAK IN OUR YARD. HE PRESCRIBED A .5 PERCENT CLOBETASOL STEROID CREAM.

                                                Began experiencing nausea and general stomach pains the morning after receiving the vaccine.  After one day of pain and discomfort I woke the following morning (~44hrs after receiving the vaccine) to extreme acute abdominal pain in the lower right abdomen.  Went to Urgent Care facility and was diagnosed by CT scan as having acute appendicitis.  An emergency appendectomy was scheduled and performed for later that evening.  I stayed at the Hospital overnight on 12/24/2020 post operatively on IV antibiotics to recover from the appendectomy.  Was discharged from the hospital on 12/25/2020 and have been recovering for about 10 days now with limitted activity.

The staff member monitoring saw me going to the floor and called the head doctor over to help.  They called EMT&#39;s.  I was laid onto the floor on my back and legs up onto a chair.  The staff took my blood pressure which was low.  Approximately, 2 minutes later, they took my blood pressure and it went back up to a more normal level.  The EMT&#39;s helped me up and took my blood sugar levels and pulse oxygen levels which seemed normal.  I was able to feel better, but the color of my skin was yellowish and pale.  The EMT&#39;s suggested that I talk with my doctor before getting another vaccine and talk about my symptoms.

Later in the day, while at work, I became extremely fatigued and my chills were getting worse.  I left work early, came home and checked my temperature.  It has been between 102.5 and 103.7 the entire time I have been home.  Even after taking Tylenol.  My arm is also a little tender at the injection site.    I had COVID prior to this but they say I recovered.    My symptoms started on November 13 and was hospitalized for 3 days starting around day 9 of symptoms.  My current symptoms are pretty much identical to the symptoms I had when I first contracted COVID.

The patient&#39;s medical history included type 1 diabetes. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 30 Dec 2020, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30 Dec 2020, the evening after vaccine administration, the patient experienced chills and tiredness.  On 31 Dec 2020 the patient woke up with his face numb and a little paralyzed. At the time of reporting, the patient mentioned that the numbness and paralysis on his face had been like that for various days and was still ongoing. Treatment for the event was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, chills and tiredness, was unknown. The outcome of the events, part of face numb and part of face a little paralyzed, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 45 year old male patient with medical history of type I diabetes, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Facial paralysis, a NS unexpected event of Hypoaesthesia, and NS expected events of Chills and Fatigue. The events of Chills and Fatigue occurred on the same day when the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273. The events of Facial paralysis and Hypoaesthesia occurred the next day of administration of mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He prescribed me a 30 day usage of the Albuterol Sulfate pump to help with the wheezing 3x a day.I saw the doctor January 23rd.3 days after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.

Then severe rash over torso, arms, buttocks, thighs, and back consistent with what I experienced during Lyme Disease this past summer.  Raised itchy rash in large red blotches over most of body.  I didn&#39;t realize it at the time but the same (but less severe) reaction took place after the first Moderna Vaccine shot as well.  I was prescribed Doxycycline by my local Urgent Care and stayed on it for 14 days following the first dose of Moderna.  I didn&#39;t put the two things together immediately because I has gone hunting in the woods and assumed that I was bitten by another tick.  Full body rash is what caused me to go seek attention at the Urgent Care.  The symptoms following the second dose were much more severe and uncomfortable.  The rash subsided in 4-5 days without medication.

Two days post vaccination, my left arm was swollen with severe redness. I am still struggling with fatigue and body aches (4 days later) but have regained mobility and strength.

                                                Approximately 24 post vaccine, I developed sinus problems, chills, and general body aches that lasted about 12 hours. I then began feeling a severe pain in my left arm at the exact site of the injection that came and went depending on movement of my arm. It felt like a torn muscle. Now, 3 weeks after my final shot, the arm pain is still present and at times feels like it&#39;s worsening. It&#39;s at its most severe when reaching for something.

Over the course of the next day, I developed a moderate to severe headache along with swelling in the lymph node under my right arm in the arm pit.  By the second day after the shot (March 3rd, 2021) all symptoms except some swelling in the lymph node had resolved.

                                                I have had a low grade fever (99.5)  for a week now.  I have had insomnia since the night of the injection.  EVERY night I wake up hot 3 hours after I went to sleep.  I have never gotten the chills, only hot.   I usually need to take a sleep aid to get back to sleep which is NOT normal for me.   Many times I wake up again 3 hours later even after the sleep aid hot.   My lack of sleep has really been hard on my daytime working and living at this point.  When I wake at night hot my temperature is usually 99.5, but has been a bit lower at times too.   I also feel that I have rapid heart rate at this time (when I try to fall back asleep)  and it seems as if my heart is beating harder than normal.  I also feel a buzzing in my head like I drank too much coffee type of feeling.  The first couple of days I felt tired and weak and a bit achy throughout the day.  The next few days after that I felt dizzy and light headed with a headache.  The first few days I also noticed slight muscle spasms throughout my arms and torso particularly when I laid down at night to go to bed and was still and relaxed.  I have been taking over the counter pain/fever pills usually for the headache.  I contacted my doctor and he said to give it a week.  It has been a week yesterday, but Dr is closed for weekends and Fridays.  I went to urgent care on Friday and they were not helpful (virtually).  They said give it 5 more days!!!!!   I am extremely tired of this and worried at how long it has been.  NOBODY I know with the first shot has had this reaction.  My wife is nervous as well and we would really like to hear something that may ease our minds at this point.  Some explanation as to why my body may be reacting this way, or if any others have had this same situation.

                                                I was feeling cold throughout the day, at about 9:00 pm I took a shower to try to get warmed up, I just kept getting colder and colder until I was severely shaking uncontrollably. Every muscle was so tense and I was shaking so badly I could barely walk or breathe. I went to the bedroom and got under blankets with a heater and in a few minutes the shaking diminished to where I could start breathing normal again. It took about an hour before my shakiness went away completely but I still needed to stay under the blankets and near the heater as I felt I was still cold and on the verge of getting the severe chills again. I had no fever. Next morning (as I&#39;m writing) I&#39;m still worried about getting out of bed as I still don&#39;t feel right and am scared of getting the chills like that again.

Once I reached the parking lot I was belching ridiculously and started feeling like vomiting. Than my chest hurt.  Went back to the clinic and said I don&#39;t feel right.  They had me stand in line and wait to be re-admitted.  The nurse starting taking blood pressure and offered me water I could not swallow the tiniest amount.  My neck felt like I was being chocked. My fingers on my left arm started tingling and arm was getting slightly red and arm felt heavy. The nurse said my symptoms were happening internally.  The doctor had me remove my mask and looked at the back of my mouth. Than used a stethoscope on my chest and the back.  Asked  if I had asthma , said no. He Than requested epinephrine shot and a steroid. With in a few seconds I started feeling like I could breathe. He prescribed an epinephrine pen incase I had another episode. Two day later I had another visit online with doctor from about redness on left and right arm. Having another allergic reaction and possible site infection. Now I&#39;m taking 10 days antibiotics and allergy medicine.

I was seated at the time, waiting the 15 minutes for observation after the shot, symptoms happened about 10 minutes into the waiting period.  I was given some cold water right away, over the next 10 minutes my vision started coming back and I stopped sweating. Was told I looked flush when they first came over but was looking much better after another 10 mins.   I stayed an additional 30 minutes for observation after the event and had friends come take me home and get my car. I&#39;m still feeling very slightly light headed and somewhat tired 2 days later, but otherwise feeling great.

                                                On 3/16/21, I noticed a rash which closely mirrors what is being described as &#34;COVID arm&#34; at the site of the injection.  This appeared after 72 hours of severe stomach pain and loose stool, combined with fatigue, dizziness, chills/hot spells and lack of appetite.  There has been no fever with any of these symptoms.  The other members of my family who live in my household (Spouse - who also has had one dose of the Moderna vaccine, and our children age 12 and 15) all experienced the same set of symptoms, except the rash at site of vaccine injection.  I thought we had all caught a stomach bug from each other, but now I wonder if my symptoms were related to the rash that I first noticed this morning.

Mild pain at injection site within a few hours.  3am (9 hours after injection) I went to the bathroom, and while standing got dizzy and lightheaded tried to sit down.  Collapsed while trying to sit down and hit head on bathroom floor.  Cut right eyebrow on floor.  Tried to get back to bed and was in and out of consciousness for 30-60 seconds per spouse.  Vasovagal response symptoms.  Cold sweats.  I was very thirsty and drank a tall glass of water.  5 minutes later I stood up and went back to bed feeling fine.  I slept the rest of the night and felt fine the next day, and for the rest of the weekend with no other symptoms.

                                                Other than typical sore arm at injection site, I began to experience massive body tremors and painful chills that started roughly 13 hours after second Moderna dose. The chills were so extreme that my abdomen tightened and caused pain that I could not relax along with jaw tightening and teeth chatter. Once in bed, I experienced severe sweating while trying to stop the chills, then massive chills when removing blankets and extreme all over body aches that caused me to toss and turn all night. I found myself fatigued and sleeping off and on until 5:30 pm (17 hours in bed) the next evening. Chills have since subsided, body aches remained- tiredness remained. Two Tylenol have mostly helped with the body aches, although they are definitely still present, even in my gut.

                                                Immediately following the second COVID shot in my left arm, I began experiencing numbness and tingling in my left arm. The pain would go to my funny bone area, and down my forearm to my middle finger. It feels exactly like when you hit your funny bone very hard. At times the pain is a discomfort and a tingling, but there are days when it is so sore I can&#39;t use the arm. The pain has been consistent for 3 weeks now.

After second dose I started experiencing L shoulder pain after 40 minutes. Pain was so severe I could not put my hand into the packet. In the evening the same day I started running temperature 101F that last 3 days non stop. I started experiencing severe chills, could not stop at times shaking! I was hot and cold every so often. I started experiencing same evening severe body ache which was constant and felt like I was squeezed by some machine. I could not sleep, I felt just terrible,  couldn&#39;t find comfortable position. My heart beat resting was 110 per minute and it stayed like that first night. My normal resting pulse is 60-70 bps. I did not have headaches or nausea. At night everything felt worse. After 3 nights temperature subsided but I was exhausted and my temperature dropped 95.9F my normal temperature is 97.88F. ( 36.6C) . Since April 2nd I have been tired and I want to sleep all the time.

                                                Soon after injection I developed soreness at injection site, and about an hour later it travelled down my arm and to my hand, with also arm stiffness.  On Monday, 4/12/2021 at 12:15am (about 6 hours after injection) I developed chills and body aches.  Throughout the night I also developed a headache, muscle aches, nausea and started sweating.  At 9am (4/12/2021) when I woke up, all the symptoms continued (chills, body aches, muscle aches, arm soreness and stiffness, headache, nausea) and also felt extreme tiredness.  My temperature at 9:15am was 100.4 degrees F.  I basically stayed in bed and slept most of the day.  I got up at 2:30pm to get something to eat and had a temperature of 101 degrees F.  After eating, which made me feel even more nauseous, I went back to bed and continued to sleep.  I woke up at 7:30pm to feed the cats.  I felt the same as I did at 2:30pm--listed above--and was up and about for 20 minutes.  I started to prepare a quick meal and fainted twice (around 8pm) within a minute from each other.  The first time I fell to my knees and the second time I felt onto my back.  I was unconscious for only a few seconds each time.  I went into bed after and placed an ice pack on my forehead.  I took my temperature after the ice pack at 8:15am and my temperature was 101.4 degrees F.   I ate soup around 8:45am and took Tylenol (1000mg) at 9:30am.  I went back to bed and slept all through the night.  This morning (4/13/2021--2 days after injection) I feel much better--only have some slight chills and arm soreness.  My temperature at 9:15am (4/13/21) was 95.7 degrees F.

                                                The next day I had a low grade headache, body aches, aching arm and tiredness.  The headache and tiredness got worse over the weekend but the arm got better.  On monday (4/5) while dealing with worse tiredness and headache I got a migraine around 3:30 pm/  tuesday(4/6) the symptoms got worse but the migraine started at about 1:00pm.  Wednesday thru Friday the migraines were so bad i could not attend work or get out of bed without a great amount of effort.  During these three days the pain in my back became more pronounced.  The pain went from the to of my skull to the belt area of my back .  The pain followed the spine mostly and spread out along my belt line.   I saw my primary doctor on Friday (4/9)and received a Toradol shot.  Many blood tests and covid tests were performed and nothing abnormal was found.  The symptoms got a little better for the next two days.  My work has a 10 days from symptoms before being allowed to come back to work so i was home until today.(4/18) I start work again tomorrow(4/19) but i still have extreme tiredenss, aches and headache.

At the time of the injection, I felt a strange nerve pain that I hadn&#39;t felt before with a vaccine or an injection.  About 2hrs post vaccine, my arm had a rubbery/dull pain sensation. About 4hrs post vaccine, my shoulder felt very weak and there was significant pain. The pain and weakness increased by the next day. Day 1-4 post vaccine, 8-9 out of 10 pain when moving or attempting to move my arm.  It&#39;s been 2 wks post vaccine, and my shoulder, although less weak, still hurts (~3-6 out of 10 depending on time of day and activity) and is still weak (perhaps 50-70% of normal).

                                                I received a shot on 7 April. A couple of days later, I received a phone call from a health facility stating, vials of the vaccine were stored outside of the temperature range recommended by Moderna, which affects the viability. The person on the phone recommended I get another 1st dose. On April 21 (2 weeks later) I received a second 1st dose, and I experienced strong side effects. Yesterday morning I had a 103-degree temperature, chills, dizziness and weakness, along with tremendous muscle pain in the injection area. Also, the injection area has a bright red circle and is hot to the touch. I said to the vaccine administrator that the injection did not feel similar to the first one because it hurt going in. She responded with that the worst part, and now it&#39;s over.

He said it just didn&#39;t feel right. When he got his first vaccine, he didn&#39;t even notice it. He noted that this second vaccine was given much further down than his first vaccine was given.  He noted that it was given approximately 7-8 cm below the acromion process. His arm was sore that day but it improved after 1 day. Then 7 days later, he had severe pain to his shoulder and upper arm. He woke up and he could not move his arm. He got up and had his son massage it and then after some time, it loosened up and he could move it.  He still has limited range of motion of his arm due to pain, his strength is decreased, the pain radiates down his arm, and the pain is impacting his work and daily activities. The pain is worse with rest.  He describes it as throbbing.

                                                I developed tinnitus in my ears about 3 to 4 hours after vaccine. I normally don&#39;t get this. Rarely after a concert or game but short lived. This has stuck around and I kept waiting for it to disappear. Unfortunately it has not. My right ear is worse than my left but the tinnitus remains so I thought I should report it. I have been looking on-line for any other reports and see none. This may be coincidence but due to lack of resolution of tinnitus, I thought I should report it. My flu-like symptoms (headache, shaking chills, sore arm) disappeared within 36 hours.

                                                I received my 2nd dose of the moderna vaccine on 1/24/21. On 1/25/21 at approx 2am I had tremmors, feeling of intense cold, headache, body pain, fatigue. That lasted until approx 0300am 1/26/21. I slept most of the day 1/25 except for taking kid to school and monitoring another at home. I had read the side effects and I felt as though things were subsiding  on 1/26 but I was still weak with body pain. I was not 100%. I was home alone with 2 kids (wife out of town). 1/25 I had a cough and was short of breath but didn&#39;t think much of it. The cough persisted. On 1/27/21 I was still short of breath. I went to a nearby fire station and had them put me on a lifepack. I was in atrial fibrillation. I could not do anything because my wife wasn&#39;t due back until 3pm. At 3PM she walked in and I walked out and drove myself to Hospital. I was diagnosed with A-Fib w/ RVR. I was in A-fib until I was cardioverted on 2/1/21 and was given a cryo-ablation.

                                                I received my Moderna COVID-19 Vaccination at approximately 0800 am on February 10, 2021. At approximately 1800 hrs the same day, I experienced a sudden onset of muscle spasms to my lower back. I was at rest, sitting in a chair at the time of onset. The muscle spasm to my lower back was extremely intense and I had difficulty walking. This continued for about 1.5 hours. Also, during this time, I experienced cramping to the arches of both my feet. This was intermittent. I also had pain/soreness to my hips bilaterally. After approximately 1.5 hours the lower back spasms and cramping to my feet subsided.  I do not have a history of lower back issues and this is my first experience of spasms of my lower back.

                                                Within a few minutes while sitting on the chair after injection, felt my heart suddenly race, a flushing sensation occurred, and I tasted something in my mouth (chemical or metallic taste).  I started to get dizzy and was sweating.  Called over the Fire Dept personnel who were administering the injections and they helped me (fluids, ECG, etc.).  During this time they stated that my blood pressure dropped to the low 40&#39;s (not sure the exact number) and my heart rate as well.  My complexion was pale to them and sweating a lot.  After administering IV fluids a few minutes later my BP and HR started to rise.  My SpO2 was good.  Transported to ER for evaluation and labwork.

My left shoulder is still a little swollen but the pain is going away. I am not itchy today.  I just wanted to make note of how itchy I was as I could not find any information on this kind of side effect.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At approximately 9:30 PM (14 hours after receiving 2nd dose of Moderna), I started with chills and being cold. At the same time, I started a fever that gradually went up to 102.2 by 3:30 AM (20 hours after receiving 2nd dose). Also noticed a headache. At 3:30 AM I did take 2 extra strength Tylenol caplets.  Fever went down, but I did notice even 24-36 hours after receiving 2nd dose, my temperature was at 99.5-99.9.  The headache remained 24-36 hours but has since subsided now at 48 hours after receiving. I do still feel mild fatigue, but I reported to work without any issues. I did notice that my arm was hardly even sore compared to 1st dose received on Feb. 6, 2021.  One week after my 1st dose on Feb. 6, I developed the COVID rash which lasted 2-3 days and went away w/o any medication.   All in all, I did not find the side effects to be bad for either dose. I would do it all over again. The side effects were more of a nuisance than anything. I would have honestly reported to work as normal if it was during the week when I received vaccine. The side effects were not that bad.

                                                At 2:00 am the following morning after my 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine I started experiencing a severe headache and body pains.  My left arm was sore and difficult to lift which is the arm I received the shot in.  Throughout the day I have continued to have a headache, body pains and developed a fever up to 101.00.  I have also felt nauseous at times and at one point threw up some of the Gatorade that I had a little while earlier.  So to summarize, all in all, I feel absolutely terrible.

It was 105/60. He claimed that was low for him. He said he feels that way when blood sugar gets low. Paramedics arrived and took BP again had come up to 130/90. We were in the process of taking his sugar when they came and did it. It was 139. Patient felt better on his own really with some candy and water. He decided not to go with paramedics. I called and checked on him this evening and he was fine.

Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

He went to bed and at 4:00 AM he started throwing up profusely and was intense and periodic until it lasted until 8:00 AM (4 hours).   He has stomach problems, but not to the extent of this.  He has been trying to control his other problems with Alka Seltzer which normally helps with his regular stomach issues, but did take 3 of them during that 4 hour period which seemed to calm his stomach down, but normally one takes 1.   His stomach is feeling better right now other than having loss of appetite, eating small bites and minimal.   Feels he may have fever right now but not feeling well enough to get up, sweaty and clammy on the back of his neck right now.  Feeling weak due to the 4 hours of vomiting.  He has not called his doctor.

The following day, or the 3rd day after the shot, I had several bouts of what I will call extreme heartburn.  Severe burning sensation across chest after eating and tingling down both arms. Painful and physically limiting on Thursday 4/15/21.  On Friday the &#34;heartburn&#34; returned after eating but a little less severe.  Slight headache was still present.  Saturday and Sunday were progressively better.  Monday 4/19/21, almost back on a regular diet.  Slight tenderness in abdominal area when palpated.

Then within 20-30 seconds I realized that my chest was heavy/pressure on my sternum, arms and torso went warm and sweaty, a bit light headed and had fast heart rate. I asked medical team for assistance. They took blood pressure/O2 levels and listen to my heart and lungs. Had epi pen ready, but never administered. Watched me like this for about hour and a half until my bp came back down to normal levels.

                                                the next day, after being vaccinated, my left shoulder muscle (deltoid), right where the vaccine was administered, I felt a bit of a discomfort. and this lasted for about 3 days. after about 3 to 4 days after being vaccinated, &#34;all&#34; my muscles started to ache a bit, and I felt a bit weak. that passed after maybe 3 to 4 days. about 4 to 5 days later, or about 10 days after being vaccinated, the outside of my left arm (where the vaccine was administered) felt strangely over sensitive; to a touch and temperature. for the most part that has subsided now. However, about 4 days ago (a little over 2 weeks after being vaccinated) my left arm feels a bit weird. the feeling is similar to a mildly pinched nerve. for instance, if you sit for sometime with an arm at a weird position, (maybe twisted), you can get a weird feeling, of a bit of a discomfort. not the one where your arm goes numb, but a bit &#34;uncomfortable&#34;. but that typically goes away after a couple of minutes after you get up and start moving your arm. Well, this is the feeling now, except that it&#39;s been like that for the past 4 days or so. However, no outside reactions, no skin discoloration, etc.  I spoke with a nurse, and she advised me to report this side effect, and to make appointment with my PCP if the symptom does not subside in the next few days.

Muscle soreness when I raised my arm above my shoulder. If I was going to examine someone for a rotator cuff injury - with the arm above that is where the soreness was. Nurse practitioner took picture of my hand that first day and the next day Dr looked at it. I had these symptoms for two weeks. My fingers are still kind of sore now. I had to try a few things to get the ring off my finger but otherwise no treatment.

                                                Pain at injection point immediately; pain using right arm for routine tasks for the following 6-8 hours; injection site remains sore to the touch after 72 hours. No other pain the day of injection. Day after injection (approximately 18 hours later) the entire right arm ached; then the aching moved to the lower back and eventually both legs. Pain resolved at approximately 30 hours after injection; ache never affected left (non-injected) arm.  Minor headache seemed to be forming, but never progressed past the initial indications. Was extremely tired the day following the injection; took two naps (1-2 hours each) and slept 12 hours that night (i.e., injected Friday, tired all day Saturday and slept longer than normal Saturday night). Aside from soreness at injection point, no further signs/symptoms on Sunday (i.e., resolved around 36 hours after injection).

Pain is about an eight and is very difficult to move without pain.  Motions such as trying to stretch a spring using both hands is painful and so is a motion such as doing lat raises on a machine.

This continued for several weeks and is still somewhat present to this day. It never &#34;hurt&#34;, but just felt numb to the touch. I was able to walk and do normal activities, but when resting or sitting/laying, it was very uncomfortable. Now, almost 6 weeks out, it has slowly started to go away, but can still feel the &#34;numbness&#34; from time to time.

He was evaluated by cardiology who suggested MSK in nature. He started lifting weights earlier this week.  His cardiac work up included EKG with NSR, CXR no acute process, troponin neg x3, inflammatory markers negative. He did have significant dyslipidemia and was counseled on importantance of healthy lifestyle, diet modification and importance of taking statin. Patient was treated with OMT with moderate improvement of symptoms and was rx&#39;d muscle relaxer for a few days to help with muscle spasm. He is to follow up with cardiology and get a repeat lipid panel in 3 months as well as follow up with PCP for stress echo and EGD if sx persist.

                                                Light case of Bell Palsy. A couple of days after vaccination, I started noticing that there was a slight change to the left side of my face. My nose and I were giving me discomfort and when I tried to smile or eat, I was having difficulty with the left side of my face. I also noticed that I had some difficulty with accuracy when I tried to spit or trouble keeping my mouth fully closed when gurgling mouthwash. I visited the doctor&#39;s office after about a week and the doctor did notice a change on one side of my face and said it was Bell Palsy, but a very slight case of it. It was too late to start on steroids, but that it looked like it was already getting better on its own.

The area was 1 ½ wide and it was in all my arm. It was itchy, burned, and painful. I went to the emergency room. The doctor said that my infection was due to the vaccine and gave me antibiotics for 10 days. After 10 days my arm was brown. No need to go back to the doctor but I still have the brownish line in my arm.

About one minute later he felt like he could not get a full breath and he felt the need to run away. We connected a heart monitor, did serial vital signs, listen to lung sounds. He symptoms seem to worsen. He did not have hives, his lungs were clear. His HR was normal but his B/P was elevated. We started and IV and gave him 25 mg mg of IV Benadryl. We contacted Dr. via phone. He talked to the patient and he agreed with our assessment and treatment.  He began feeling better about 10 min after the Benadryl and he symptoms cleared by 30 min after Benadryl. We kept him on the heart monitor for 1 hour.  He reported he felt fine and back to normal when he left to go home. He refused ambulance transport to the hospital. All reports will be filled out by me.

                                                Good morning, I received my 2nd shot yesterday at approximately 9:15a.  I had no issues during the observation period.  Last night at approximately 9:45p I started to feel as if I was catching a fever due to my joints aching and bland taste in my mouth.  At approximately 10:15p I started to shiver, had a headache and had tightness in the lower left side of my back.  So I took my temperature and I had a low grade fever 99.7.  At the point I went and had a hot shower.  After that I laid on the heating pad for 30 minutes and my back tightness subsided.  I stopped shivering at roughly 11:15p but continued to have a headache and aching joints.  My temperature right now is 100.3, joints are still aching but not as bad as last night, headache and chills.  Is there anything that I can take, Advil etc?  Also, I forgot to mention the arm soreness as well but I had that on the 1st shot as well.

Tenderness over lateral shoulder/SIT tendons.  Positive impingement sign.  Seems to be tendon/shoulder injury d/t faulty injection technique.  I had minimal shoulder soreness after the first injection.

                                                Since receiving Moderna shot #1 vaccine I have experienced three gout attacks. It is unusual for me to have this many gout attacks in such a short time period. Additionally, physical activity has been very challenging since receiving the shot.  I fatigue and become short of breath very quickly. During the first workout that I did, on 02/01/2021, after receiving the shot I became extremely dizzy, my eyes became light sensitive and my hands trembled; symptoms lasted for approximately 45 minutes.

The rash was raw feeling and at times itchy.  It was criss crossed lines of rash that were within raised whelps.   Benadryl helped relieve the symptoms of discomfort and the raised rash within an hour each time it occurred.

                                                The day after the injection I had a sore arm, slight headache and slight nausea. Since that time I have had a slight &#34;pressure&#34; headache almost continuously.  Today is 2/24/21, more than 6 weeks after the first shot and the symptoms have only slightly subsided. I have decided to forego the second shot until the symptoms completely disappear. I have not sought any medical care because the symptoms are not severe enough and I am hoping they will subside by themselves. If they continue for a long period I will seek medical care but my guess is there will not be a lot that can be done.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

                                                A few minutes after the shot i started getting dizzy. it increased with intensity so i flagged down an attendant for help. I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

The episode lasted for 30 seconds to 1 minute and he slept for about half an hour afterward. He has since been more subdued and listless but is beginning to display more of his typical behaviors again. She said he has had milder seizure like activity in past when his head tilts backward and he has stiffness and staring with last episode of this being 6 months ago. Last grand mal seizure occured when he was young and related to issues with his shunt.

This did not start going down until today.  I am not intending on seeking medical attention.    I ran very high fevers that were not able to be taken down by Tylenol right away.    I was out of my head with a little confusion and delirium for a few hours.  I experienced muscle aches and fatigue. I experienced itchy and crawly feelings on my skin.

Sitting upright in a char and driving a car made the pain worse. Difficulty sleeping due to pain and having to sleep on one side. Soothed the pain temporarily with a menthol rub but the pain would not go away  Sunday, March 7: Pain (burning, stinging, aching, quaking) unbearable to the point that I stayed in bed most of the day but could not sleep. Sitting upright continued to make pain worse. Menthol rub did not make pain go away. Pain intensified throughout the day in left shoulder and neck, shoulder blade, arm, and hand.  Monday, March 8: Appointment with Dr, internal medicine specialist who is my mother&#39;s primary care physician. Dr. suspected that I may be suffering from brachial neuritis and recommended that I see a neurologist for further diagnosis. He prescribed Gabapentin (nerve pain medication) and a series of steroid medication (Prednizone) for me to take throughout the week. I asked him how long I would have to take the medication in weeks/months to come. He said as long as I am feeling the pain. That night, when I started taking the medication, the pain flared up deep in my shoulder and down my arm like a fireball!   Tuesday, March 9 - Thursday, March 11: Gabapentin was not effective with reducing extreme pain. Dr. instructed me to increase dosage as needed. A day later, he called in a prescription for -------, a pain medication that he said I could take with Gabapentin to help strengthen relief. Made appointment with Dr, neurologist with Medical Group.   Friday, March 12:  Appointment with Dr. Initial tests suggest to him that my condition could be either brachial neuritis. He ordered MRI and EMG nerve test. I asked if I would be able to drive back to home. He advised against driving at all given my medications and ongoing pain, as well as the need to arrive at a clear diagnosis. I asked him what I should do about getting the second Moderna shot. He told me that I should not get the second shot. I am scheduled to get the second shot on Friday, March 26, at a vaccination site, State University.

Irregular heart rhythm and breathing especially during sleep. Intense headaches for roughly 8 days, high blood pressure. Roughly days 4,5,6, being the worst for the headaches, blood pressure and rhythm.  Also, day 8 and 9 after the vaccination, sudden red spot on left arm, site of injection appeared, being itchy. Diminished day 10.   Day five and six  I was very concerned with out of synch breathing, headaches and high blood pressure.  Hands still flashes of being cold, and less severe headaches.

                                                Three days after receiving my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine, I had a sudden onset of tinnitus. I&#39;ve never had tinnitus symptoms before with any other vaccine or in general (aside from acute tinnitus after rock concerts), much less sudden onset tinnitus. Once the normal, published side effects (aching, sore arm, fatigue) subsided, I immediately began noticing a constant ringing/buzzing in my ears. The left ear is more prominent, but I have it in both ears. I also experience a higher sensitivity to loud sounds. As of 4/2/2021, I still have mild-moderate ringing in my ears, especially in quiet situations.

                                                Client received his first dose of Covid vaccine in the clinic on 4/1/2021 at approximately 10:25 a.m.  Client was walked to the courtroom for observation for 15 minutes post-vaccination.  This is standard procedure.  When his 15 minutes was up, Nurse informed him that his time was up and he was free to go, and signed him out.  As she was speaking with him, she noticed he was disoriented.  She asked if he was all right and fanned his face for a few seconds. 2nd nurse came by at that time, and the women helped pt. back to the clinic and onto a pad on the floor in a nurse?s office. Third person was called. Vitals were taken several successive times (BP ranged from 148/99 to 155/104), Temp was normal and in 97.5 to 98.4 range.  Resp 16-18. Pulse was between 78 and 93.  Client was disoriented, could not state his name and could not name anyone for us to call.  Ammonia salts were employed with no effect.  All emergency meds, oral airways, and AED were gathered in case they were needed. No other meds or equipment were used. By standard called for the clerk, and By standard, to call paramedics.  She called 911 x 2 and when put through to EMS, was given a disconnect notice.  She ran down the hall to the constable?s offices, who placed the call and had paramedics on their way.  Then two constables (male and an unknown female constable) came to the Health Dept.   Third person got the client to answer with whom to call. Third person called the client?s mother-in-law and employer.  Both arrived after the client was transferred via ambulance and left to join him immediately at the hospital.  As all this was happening, Nurse, 2nd Nurse, third person, and Bystander were attempting to ensure pt. airway and breathing were patent.  He never had difficulty breathing and never had wheezing.  There were no other visible signs of anaphylaxis. His color was pale, then improved, but became pallid again at about the time the paramedics arrived.  He was never alert or oriented throughout the event. Paramedics arrived at approximately 11:00 a.m. They did an initial assessment and received report on what had occurred and data gathered.  They then had to lift pt. onto the stretcher.  He was then transported to Hospital.

                                                Injection site soreness 8 hours later, development of flu like symptoms. Next day full flu like symptoms, muscle aches, headaches, chills, weakness. Lasted for 4 days. On day 5 lungs really became sore and O2 began dropping into the mid to upper 80s again. Patient is a previous Covid pnuemonia patient with ground glass nodules from Covid 5 months ago. The lung pains and 02 swings felt as bad as Covid pnuemonia back in October and lasted for about 2 weeks. During this time the patient started Symbicort and Abuterol inhalers again for treatment of the lung issues.

First major side effect started to kick in around 1700 (5pm) on Thursday April 8 2021.  At that time my voice started cracking, fading in and out with a sore/scratchy throat.  When I woke up on Friday April 9 2021 at 0700 my voice was gone and my throat has a numb feeling to it.

                                                Patient was coherent during initial injection, as I removed my gloves and asked he remain in the waiting area for 15 minutes his chin fell to his chest and he began to breath heavily. I spoke to him and there was no response. He then began making snoring type noises and lifted his head but again was unresponsive. Patient then slumped sideways in the chair. I made one last attempt to arouse him with firm strikes to the chest and calling his name. I retrieved the EpiPen from the e-kit and as I removed it from the box he became conscious. He opened his eyes and gasped and tremored slightly. He was not immediately responsive verbally. I observed him carefully to evaluate if he was going to have a seizure, but he then became coherent. He was alert and oriented to time and place but did ask how ling it had been since the vaccine. He admitted to having a problem with needles and stated that was the root of the reaction. He does not remember any reactions to previous vaccines but also could not recall his last vaccination. We brought the patient water and offered snacks while he recovered in the patient care area. Approximately 20-30 minutes after the initial event the patient began vomiting. After a few minutes of vomiting he said he felt a little better and wanted to go to his car to lay down. Multiple times we asked if we could call someone to come pick him up and offered to have him seen by paramedics that happened to be shopping in store. He declined both offers and stated he would lie down in his car and call someone if he did not feel well after awhile. Staff checked on him in his car and he was instructed to call in before leaving. Upon trying to check on him again it was noted his car was gone. I called the patient and he assured me he was ok and he was now at home.

Primarily radiating across back, but also more generalized to arms, neck, and head. In line with shingles episode two years ago. Also some fever and joint pains. Onset of neuralgia came a few days after vaccination, got worse over a period of a week, and then started improving. No anti-viral therapy was used. A combination of advil and tylenol was self-administered as needed. After a period of 18 days the pains had subsided.

When my right side feels cold the left side feels hot. That nerve sensation today a little better but not too much - it has gone from a 1 to a 1 1/2 so it definitely hasn&#39;t gotten better.  I have weakness in my right hip and leg. I am having some right leg pain that starts at the top and goes to the bottom of foot. My mobility is suffering.  I have an MRI coming up on my head on the 26th.  No treatment at all so far. I have a neurologist appt coming up next Wednesday.

The pain and numbness worsened throughout Saturday and Sunday with an increase of right leg pain on Sunday.  On Friday,  April 9, the patient noticed a numbness and drooping of his face which progressed to his eye not being able to close.  Today, April 15, he presented with two prescriptions for prednisone and erythromycin eye ointment.

                                                About 30 min after leaving the vaccination site I was driving home and felt face getting flush and tingly, on one side of my face. Felt slight swelling of my mouth and tongue. Those lasted about 45 min to an hour and they dissipated and then about a week later I started having a full body sensation, I started feeling like a burning sensation all through my body, like an internal sunburn all through my body and I have been feeling like that ever since. It also started oscillating between the burning sensation and a cold sensation. I also feel like pins and needles and most recently numbing of my hands and arms. It has been chronic since then. My PCP told me to take Zyrtec 30mg a day OTC and it did not help. I then met with a neurologist and allergist. Allergist did not believe it was an allergic reaction. The neurologist prescribed prednisone and it did not help. She also prescribed B12 (I have a history of B12 deficiency) and  she initially diagnosed me with sensory malfiber polyneuropathy. She has been running some auto immune tests and some have come back normal and she is trying to figure it out the next plan of care. It is not just a sensation, part of it is physiological because my ears for example sometimes get very red and hot to the touch and my hands get very cold.

                                                Patient received Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. About 10 minutes after injection patient was not looking well. I escorted him to a private area where he continued to be light headed, pale in appearance, and communicated in short sentences. While sitting patients BP was 60/40 and pulse was thready. He was placed on the floor with legs elevated and EMS called. Lungs were clear and normal, heart tones normal as well. No sings of angioedema at any point of his episode. 3 minutes later BP increased to 80/60 with a stronger radial pulse, and a recheck again about 5 minutes later resulted in a BP of 110/72 with regular radial pulse. EMS arrived and assessed patient. He refused transfer to hospital. He was given time, water, and a small meal as he had not eaten or drank much of anything through is night shift. After about 30 minutes he was able to ambulate through the auditorium and stated he was feeling much better. We encouraged him to take the remainder of the day off but he declined and returned to work. He stated he would return if any symptoms were to reoccur or if he had any concerns. He will have his next dose of vaccine in clinic.

                                                I woke up on Sat April 17th the day after my 2nd dose of Moderna and went to the bathroom. I was sitting on toilet and next thin i know i&#39;m waking up on the ground looking at the shower. I had blacked out. I then managed to pull myself up and was looking at the mirror in my bathroom and next thing i know i am waking up.  I had blacked out again.  My wife then discovered me on the floor and helped me up and to bed.  There is a cracked tile in my bathroom so i believe i knocked my head pretty good. I felt woozy and had a large scrape on  my right shoulder from one of the falls.  I was put into concussion protocol by wife;  The rest of the day i had the normal side effects of moderna: Fever, chills, headaches, sore left arm, and took tylenol extra strength, rested, hydrated, etc.  I felt better later in the day and by the next day Sunday April 18th i felt much  better;  I was able to drive and get errands done, but felt &#34;Foggy&#34;.  I felt back to 100% maybe by Tuesday April 20th.  My concern is the blackouts not being known. If someone was operating heavy machinery or driving the day after their 2nd shot and blacked out that is a major cause for alarm.

                                                First injection, no issues.  Second injection led to blood glucose of 368 about an hour post injection.   Beginning the morning of Sunday, 04/18/21, I had a low blood glucose episode early in the morning (meaning blood glucose 30 mg/dL or below). Typical to these I react by sweating profusely, trembling, visual anomalies, anxiety.   Never in my life have I experienced what I did on 04/18/21 concurrent with low blood glucose out of dozens and dozens of such episodes in my lifetime since being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 3. I suffered right side weakness (hand, arm, leg, trouble focusing right eye). My blood glucose at that time was low and I immediately drank some juice and ate something, but even an hour into the episode I was experiencing right side weakness and difficulty keeping my footing and hand action.

He was  found to have bilateral transverse and straight sinus thrombosis, multifocal ischemia consistent with venous infarction.   He was treated with heparin drip from diagnosis 5/11 and transitioned to apixaban 5/22. His mentation improved. As of today, he is conversant, disoriented, ambulatory, no longer requiring a feeding tube.

                                                I received my first Moderna shot on March 22 and my second on April 19. I had very bad side effects both times, though the second was worse with chills, dizziness, some light fever, body aches, sweating. This lasted up to two weeks after my second dose. I hardly ever take sick time off, but I had to leave work several times due to vaccine symptoms showing up.  A month later, around May 15th, I started to feel a waxy feeling on the roof of my mouth and I had noticed even before this that I couldn&#39;t whistle like I normally can. By May 23, I went to the ER for facial paralysis on my right side. I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy. At this moment it&#39;s just my face, no other body parts.

                                                On 4/26 around 4pm 2 Moderna vaccine doses were drawn up for immediate administration to patients with the evening appointments that day.  By 7pm the last 2 appointments did not show up. The pharmacist placed the 2 syringes in the fridge to report as waste the next day in inventory counts. This pharmacist did not work the next morning. On 4/28, the pharmacist working the afternoon shift thought the 2 drawn up syringes were from that morning and administered one to patient patient. Moderna manufacturer was contacted on 4/29 to advise on next steps and if re-vaccination was required since greater then 12 hours passed after puncture. They advised that the reason for the 12 hour window after puncture of the vial is because it does not contain preservative and to avoid potential infection it should be disposed of after 12 hours, however the vaccine is viable for 30 days in the fridge at manufacturer?s temperature. The vaccine administered was within the 30-day window, in date and remained in the fridge the entire time. The patient was called two times after their vaccination to check in for any adverse event or signs of infection. The patient said they were fine, only a sore arm for a few days, no signs of infection or other adverse reaction. The 1st dose was not re-administered. Patient was administered the 2nd vaccine on 5/26, 28 days later. The pharmacy updated their procedures for immediate vaccine disposal before leaving for the evening and other procedures such as clear labels and individual draws to avoid this same error. All staff were retrained.

                                                slight burning sensation at time of injection , then no symptoms for 3-4 hours, then pain started  at site of injection and continued to worsen through the rest of the day.  Nest day woke up with severe pain in left arm from below the site of injection (upper triceps) region down to the elbow , got severe enough to not be able straighten my arm fully without major discomfort.  Took Advil 800 mg , that made it better but not completely. By evening time felt like i was tired and like what i feel like when i am about to get a cold.   Next day was not tired , feeling of getting sick was no longer there and pain got slightly better by midday.   Next day after that woke up with slight swelling in the site and the arm was red and was warm to touch.  That continued for 2 days and gradually got less red and swollen and started to itch.  Took almost a week for the itch to completely subside.

                                                I had my second injection on Sunday morning 1/24/21 at 9:00 AM.  I was fine through the day.  The previous dose (dose #1) was on 12/29/20 and I became symptomatic the following day.  I had aches, malaise and fevers of 102.7 on 12/30/20.  The fevers lasted approximately 12 hours and resolved with Tylenol.  My left deltoid was very swollen and quite painful.  The swelling and pain resolved within 24 hours after the first injection.  Prior to dose #2 and through the day on 1/24, I used Tylenol and Celebrex, both medications were ingested at 8:45 and the tylenol wa again ingested at 11pm prior to going yo bed.  By 12:15, I had severe bilateral calf pain.  Fever started shortly after that.  Severe Headaches and Photophobia began at around 1 am.  I had a vey difficult time walking and was quite dizzy through the night.  Unable to sleep more than a couple of minutes at a time.  By 6:45 am, my fever was around 103.5.  I have used Tylenol and Ibuprofen since 1/25/21, 6:45 am.  both medications have been utilized around the clock on TID basis.  Fever dissipated by 1/25/21 evening.  Only a mild headache is present.  The injection site was swollen, indurated and painful to touch similar to cellulitis.  I have not used antibiotics, drew a line and have monitored the redness, it is slowly resolving.    By 17:30 on 1/26/21, I have a mild headache, mild malaise and chills.  No fever.  Arm is still swollen red and hot.

                                                Starting the next day, I had an increased sensitivity to motion sickness.  This is unusual as I am a paramedic and work in an ambulance for a living.  I also suffered 2 nights of insomnia.  On the evening of the third day, I developed joint aches, fatigue, and a series of normal bowel movements (five in 2 hours). The next morning I added a lost of balance and a slight right side facial droop around my eye (no numbness). Later that day I developed nausea and vomiting, a single period of cold chills followed by a period of a hot flash.  However, I never developed a fever.  By day five, all of my symptoms resolved with the balance issue being the last.  Also of note, early on, my blood sugar was elevated, blood pressure was elevated, and pulse elevated.

Last night, on day 8, after five&#43; days of no pain whatsoever, and through the night to today (day 9) I am again experiencing acute arm pain similar to  the worst pain I felt in the days after the injection, both at the injection site and radiating down my arm and into my shoulder.  I took Tylenol which has provided some relief, but my range of arm motion is still limited by sharp pain.

Less than 24 hours later developed chills, sweat, aches and pain.  By 30 hours after the injection I developed pain in my lower back that spread to my right ground.  In 48 hours I was now experience excruciating  pain in my groin with a constant and intolerable pain down my leg into the knee area which continued for hours.  I was unable to find a position of comfort and was taken to the ER .  I was immediately given a morphine drip which was not successful and then administered Dilaudid for the pain which was able to calm it down but not end it.  At the time of this writing (About 72 hours after 2nd injection) I am unable to stand or walk without pain in my groin and knee area.  Part of my thigh and Knee are have developed numbness and extreme discomfort.  I can finally only sit with much pain.  This Moderna Vaccine was administered through my employer.

Three days after the shot, I noticed slight lymph node shooting pain on my right jaw, under ear.   I?ll be getting the second shot...it beats COVID-19 by at least a mile!

Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

PCP noted in retrospect, a similar event happened soon after his 1st vaccine dose - he received his first COVID-19 vaccine dose 1/26/21 at 13:00.  Nursing Progress note from 1/27/21 at 18:05, stated patient was transfered to ER for ??cool clammy skin and discoloration all over body?? (he was admitted for UTI, so it was thought his clammy discolored skin was associated with this acute illness) - He recovered from this first event without issue.

In fact, it is the gentlest shot I have ever received. Later that night I felt some pain in my left arm, which increased significantly that next day. The pain last for about two days, then almost suddenly went away. The pain then moved between by arm and neck for about 12 hours before going away. There were no other symptoms that I was aware of.

At first he said he felt uneasy and he then later described feeling &#34;like he was tripping&#34;.   He later started feeling confused.  He went to bed around 11p.m. and woke up feeling very tired and achy but was also having a lot of trouble concentrating.  Later in the evening he was acting very confused and he didn&#39;t look well at all.  He was having difficulty verbalizing and conveying his thoughts, he couldn&#39;t remember words and at one point he actually called me &#34;mom&#34;.  I am concerned.  He said he would contact the hotline for adverse reactions on 2/26 if he still felt the same, but I felt it was important to report it either way.  He has never behaved this way before and has no medical history of any sort of memory or mental issues.

While I do report my daily progress on V-SAFE it does not allow for detailed reporting and it does not have a radio button for hot flashes that WILL NOT GO AWAY.    Approx 30-60 min after the vaccine I did get a headache which has continued (still have it).  I did get dizziness and fatigue which has somewhat subsisted and has gotten better (comes and goes) but the headache remains and now I have hot flashes that came out of nowhere last night.  It continues with the headache.    Nothing has changed from my routine nor have I been around anyone new or traveled recently.

                                                My arm was sore for 3 days as though I had been punched really hard.  After that  my deltoid became incredibly irritated and I started having stabbing, excruciating pain in my should any time it moved.  This lasted until I went in to get a shot of local anaesthetic from my doctor  on 2/25/21.  I was taking advil, tylenol, a muscle relaxer, lydecane cream and then I got the shot of anaesthetic.  I slowly had a little bit of improvement in mobility.  13 days after my vaccine, I was no longer experiencing shooting pain in my shoulder.  It is now March 1st and I think I have regained about 70% of my  mobility in that arm.  I believe that the shot made my deltoid flex and freak out and this ended up causing bicep tendinitis.  This is also my doctor&#39;s theory.

Head arch, sore body, weakness, chills, a little shortness of breath with a slight cough.  Right now at 2:37 PM on 3/26/2021 I feel about like I did on day 3 of when I had COVID. I still have some of the symptoms, but they are much more diminished.

Within 4 hour of receiving his vaccine (IM, left deltoid), he experienced &#34;numbness&#34; in his left arm which he further described as altered sensation rather than lack of sensation.  Describes numbness as extending from left shoulder to his wrist involving his entire shoulder and arm.  Further, described a band of numbness that extends from his posterior shoulder, down his back, and extended to his knee.  No motor weakness.  No difficulty walking or difficulties with hand dexterity.   This resolved suddenly after 3 hours.  He did not take any medications nor was he evaluated by a clinician. No previous history of strokes, TIA, or similar symptoms.  No pertinent medical history.    His only medication is OTC ibuprofen.

                                                Once, for a short time while performing a mild workout in the gym, and again a couple hours later, and for an extended duration (approximately 40 minutes),  while checking out at Costco I experienced what I believe to have been aura migraines without headache (or ocular migraines) in my right eye. What initially appeared to be a slight glare, I later determined was an obscuration of the lower half of my vision in that eye which could be described as a clouding effect.  While disorienting and concerning, with closing/covering that eye, the problem slowly resolved itself. Within about 20 minutes, I had enough vision to comfortably and safely drive home. Another 20 minutes after that and the event had ended as far as I could tell.  I have never experienced anything like this in the past. Doing some (dangerous, I know) searching online, I discovered what it might be called and learned that there were some reports of similar events occurring with other vaccine recipients. Since I don&#39;t have a primary care physician, I&#39;m hoping it is directly related to the vaccine and I hope it doesn&#39;t happen again with the second dose since my eyes are a critical part of my job.

About 9:45 am driving, I noticed my face starting to numb on my right hand side beginning with my upper lip, around my nostril, cheek and jaw line. After an hour of numbness, I called my doctors office and spoke with a nurse. The nurse had not heard of these symptoms before and sent me to the local ER at the hospital. As we drove to the ER, I noticed my jaw muscles getting tighter, but not so over powering that it felt like it would lock up. While under observation for an an hour or so, a Physician?s Assistant did neurological exams as my symptoms looked like a potential mild stroke. I passed the exams and sent home to observe any changes. The morning of day two (today), I have strong flu like symptoms with chills, shivering, aching muscles and the skin on my back and neck have a pins and needles feeling. What?s more, I have a present ringing in my ears today.

                                                Within two minutes of being injected, I had a flush sensation throughout my body and became very nauseous, faint and got a headache. The symptoms persisted for 30 minutes so the pharmacist called an ambulance to the store.  The paramedics checked my vital signs which were stable but recommended that I go to the nearest hospital for further examination and treatment.

                                                He got the vaccine, started to get the headache within 45 minutes, ran some errands and after a couple of hours he felt like something was burning on his buttock, and noticed a really bad red rash on the left side on the left cheek from the crack outward. It was extremely hot to the touch and very sore, kind of throbbing and swollen and progressively got worse. He was just not feeling well, nauseous and dizzy and went to sleep but when he woke up it had spread to the other cheek. It looks like he got burned or scalded red/purple in color. He has no reaction on the arm itself, but only on the buttock and a blistery, blood red, leathery feeling rash/blotch on his entire buttock to both hips on both sides. It is difficult for him to sit. He also had headache, the muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea.  He did not vomit but had not eaten anything. He has had a high fever up to 103 until this morning 4/8/21 which is about 99-100.  He woke up soaking wet today. He has not been able to turn his neck, and not able to lift his arm above his waist level since the vaccine, and not able to turn his neck to the left at all. He can turn it 5-10 degrees, but right is okay. He took some Benadryl over the last 2 days for the reaction but it has not. He also has taken aspirin/Aleve for the fever. He was so sock and had no energy and could not sleep but could not keep his eyes open either, was not able to open them. He did write his doctor when the rash was only on one side, which they did not give him any advice as he was not feeling any worse at that time. He was at 101 fever throughout the day and then at night went to 102. He was hoping that the rash would be better, but actually worse as described above. He has not had any appetite, trying to drink fluids but made him nauseous, and he normally drinks water all day long. His normal temp is 97.7. He has been taking showers to try and keep his fevers down and the water hitting the rash feels like somebody is pouring scolding water on it. He did call Moderna on 4/6/21 asking if this was a reaction that anybody has reported, and he is waiting for somebody to call him back.

Woke up at 2:15 AM and couldn?t move. My arms and hands and feet were completely paralyzed. Couldn?t speak or call out. Slowly started attempting to move fingers and feet and head. After several minutes was able to roll over on stomach. Could not move. After several minutes of attempting movement was able to push myself up and grab a piece of furniture. After several more minutes was able to get legs to move sufficiently to walk to bathroom by holding onto furniture and leaning against walls and door jams. Still feeding feeling feverish with chills. My son took my temperature with a forehead scanning thermometer and it registered at 100.3. He said my skin felt extremely hot. Took 1000 mg acetaminophen.  Finally was able to go back to sleep around 4 AM and slept for a couple more hours. Woke up just before 7 AM and was able to stand and walk with some effort. Currently 9:30 AM and still have aches and pains and difficulty walking.

My left shoulder and neck are cramping (up to my ear) and raising my arm is painful.  Even my left knee is bothering me.  The amount of discomfort is surprising.  I had none of these symptoms prior to the injection.

                                                When administered, the first Moderna COVID shot leaked and I did not get the full dosage per the nurse.  She then gave me a second complete Moderna shot.  Both shots were in my left arm.  No real reaction at first except the typical arm pain.  However, I noticed something within the first day that I haven&#39;t noticed since.  First, I felt sharp pain in my left hand back around between my thumb and left pointer finger by the next day for about 30 min. and minutes later felt sharp pain in the top of my left foot.  I haven&#39;t experienced any further symptoms as the shoulder pain dissappeared in a few days but this does appear to be related to the shot in retrospect so felt it should be reported.

Also experienced weakness in the right hand that limited ability to firmly hold a pen.  Itching only lasted for a few minutes.  Weakness in hand lasted about 30 minutes, but experienced again the following morning (almost 24 hours since vaccination) that lasted for a few minutes.  No treatment was received for the itching or hand weakness.

                                                Joint pain in the left foot and ankle, and both wrists.  Started about 3 to 4 days after first Moderna vaccine.  Progressively worsened over the next week until I had sever pain-8 out of 10 in joints of both shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and the left foot/ankle.  Pain became debilitating and went to local medical clinic.  Ran blood tests. A week later pain worsened and went to ER.  Could barely get out of bed, walk.   ER doc put me on a tapering course of Prednisone for 12 days.  Almost complete relief of joint pain within 4 hours.  Once down to 10 mg per day the pain returned.   Had a GP telemed appointment and doc put me back on prednisone-30mg per day.  Not complete relief of pain but certainly better than nothing.

I will say that I am not sure this is related to the shot but wanted to report it as it is different from any other skin reactions I&#39;ve had.  It&#39;s been three weeks now and it still itches and burns as much as it did three weeks ago.  I have tried applying Triamcinolone Acetonide .1% steroid cream which does help.  I have also tried antibiotic ointment covered by bandages overnight (no effect), Eucerin (no effect), and Aquaphor (no effect).

Throughout the night I was soaked with sweat that I had to change three clothes before daybreak. The fever was so intense that it elicited rigor. I was shaking in the bed.  Besides, I contacted Corona virus at first week of November 2020. I was diagnosed after my emergency visit to hospital. I recover naturally without another emergency visit. I only took Advil and inhaled hot steams mixed with lemon and garlic. Counld my antibody be the reason for my intense fever experience after vaccinnation?

                                                Patient felt faint within 2 minutes of vaccination. His vision went dark. When I walked back into the room he was pale and sweating, but responding to questions from the person he arrived with. His arm twitched a few times and his head rolled to the side for a few seconds. Then he regained consciousness, but momentarily looked confused. The patient has a history of seizures, but has not suffered from one in 10 years. After that, the patient remained alert, but continued to sweat and felt light headed for most of standard wait time post vaccination.

Then about 3 or 4 days after I continued to remain sick and I passed out on the kitchen floor, my wife called the ambulance and they took me to the ER. They gave me some fluids and ran an EKG on my heart. I was observed for a few hours and released to go home later.  They did not give me any medications.

                                                Early in the morning of January 9th, 2021, the day after receiving my first injection, I woke up in bed with extreme soreness and moderate swelling at the injection site. On a scale from one to ten, the level of discomfort was seven or eight. I had expected at least some soreness as I normally have soreness after receiving flu shots and other injections. However, I was very surprised as to how sore my arm really was. Fortunately, when I woke up the next day, January 10th, the pain had mostly subsided, with just a little swelling evident at the injection site.

                                                Onset of shortness of breath and cough on 1/3 that progressively got worse. Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia without fever was made, patient started azithromycin on 1/5 and albuterol treatments every 4-6 hrs. Initially he improved, but then worsened.  chest xray on 1/6 was negative for pneumonia, PCR covid test was negative, albuterol treatment did not bring much relief. He started respiratory distress on 1/10 and was taken by car to the local ER where another covid test was negative and chest CT revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli. The leg US revealed blood clots in both of his legs. He had an emergency catheter-delivered thrombolysis and was discharged home from the ICU on 1/12 on oral anticoagulants. He is gradually improving, but very weak. He tires easily and gets a drop in oxygen to 90- 93%, as well as an increase in the heart rate to 120  when walking less than half a mile. He runs out of breath with exertion.

Shortly after, fever developed over 100 degrees F.  By &#43;9 hours, fever reached 102, and I became disoriented badly, to include loss of balance and some speech issues.  Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.  All temps via temporal sensor thermometer.

Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

                                                Received Vaccine on Friday January 15th 2021 at approximately 0715am after my Isolation and having had no symptoms for over a week.  Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

                                                On 12 FEB 2021 I received my first dosage of the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine, Lot 016M20A. On the day of the vaccination, the pain from Psoriatic Arthritis  (primarily bi-lateral feet was low in comparison to the average level of pain over the last 7 days).  There was also discomfort in the hips which for time to time had presented with point pain at the connection of the hip to the Femur. BLUF: Most significant joint/muscoskeletal pain related to exacerbation locations for Psoriatic Arthritis that I have ever endured since receiving the injection.  Prepared for second vaccination, but fearful of PSA not being in control and dramatic escalation in discomfort in feet and hips, affecting ability to walk.  I received my vaccination at some time after 1400 hours, 12 FEB.  No issues noted until approximately 2300 hours, 12 FEB, when significant and debilitating pain was noted in multiple joints or areas affected by recent Psoriatic Arthritis exacerbations.   Initial Pain made it difficult to sleep from the 12th into the 13th due to significant discomfort. Through that first night, the pain immediately flared, bilateral feet, left and right hip and point pain at three locations on veterbrae, (lower, mid and upper back).  Pain was most pronounced in feet and left hip,  the feet (all toes seemed to throb in pain and were sensitive to touch or simple movements).  Pain in feet and left hip was a 10/10.  Left hip pain was slightly different than the point pain and seemed to radiate out from the area where it connects to the femur. 13 FEB: By 0815 on 13 FEB the pain in the right foot and right hip decreased, as well as the pain in the lower, mid and upper back but the pain in the left foot and left hip continued, slightly less strong than the night prior.  Pain level decreased to 8/10 for left foot and hip and was down to a 5/10 for the right foot and hip and a 3/10 for the areas on the back. In the evening of 13 FEB it was noted that the pain in the left hip became more generalize:d vice the specific point pain that I have witnessed off/on since SEP 2020.  Continued to note evening pain that felt like burning/tingling pain on both feet.  At this point the pain in the evenings appeared to be worse than the AM pain.   Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 It should be noted, that left shoulder discomfort from the injection never exceed 2/10 as it appeared 24 hours after the injection.  More pain in shoulder associated with mobility/rotation? I lacked the ability to simply walk through the house due to the pain throughout the past 36 hours.   14 FEB: Less discomfort in AM, but still greatest in left foot. Left Foot: 7/10 Fight foot: 4/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 3/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 4/10 PM:  Significant increase in pain at bed time. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 15 FEB: AM: continued lessening of pain/discomfort in AM, but appeared back throughout the day, worsening at evening.  Pain in left hip was noted to be much more pronounced shooting out in multiple directions, to include causing discomfort from the rear of the hip, and when seated shooting pain in the direction of my inner thigh from the back of my hip.  Pain in feet continues to be like a burning/tingling pain in the evening, most pronounced in 2nd and 3rd toes on my left foot and big toe and little toe on my right foot.  The pain also appears to be much greater at evening than in AM. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: Left Hip 8/10 right hip 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10-not much change-very point specific pain.. I am not witnessing fatigue or any other problems other than joint/musco skeletal pain.  I have also not been getting shooting pain in feet that has appeared from time to time which feels like someone hammering nails into individual toes or shots of violent pain, only a sustained burning/tingling pain. four days later the Psoriatic Arthritis locations continue to rage following the vaccine, most notably bilateral feet and left hip, where the pain in the hip appears to be radiating in multiple directions.

Took patients vitals before Ambulance arrive and it was still stable.  Ambulance arrived and patient was taken to the hospital.

At 5:00 pm, I got out of work, I went straight home because I felt so weak and my eyes got watery (didn&#39;t go to work out afterward) and I got the chills and my bones started to hurt, I went to bed and slept all - my bones were in horrific pain - especially in my back. Saturday morning, I felt the same -I took OTC med for the pain - no fever; body aches, watery eyes and I was very weak. I drank orange juice and I took some Zinc; vitamin C - and I hurt all that day - bones still achy but not quite as much. Sunday morning, I wasn&#39;t normal but better and by Sunday noon I was better; not weak anymore. On a scale from one to 10, I felt like a ten when it was bad. My injection site was sore for a good four days. I took it on a Friday but Tuesday the arm was good to go.

Most common site is over both shoulder area but it can appear randomly on the back, chest, and abdomen area. It is a lot less intense as time passes but certainly not a normal feeling. Medically speaking it feels like it is coming from subcutaneous nerves.

                                                Starting the day after dose 2 of COVID vaccination, left arm was numb and tingley.  Throbbing at night when sleeping on left side.  Vaccination did hurt when it was administered.  It felt much different at the time of vaccination; more pain, than the first COVID vaccination which was in the  other arm.  Saw medical provider after one month, since symptoms were not resolving.  6 day course of Prednisone was ordered and taken.  Symptoms are better, but not gone.  Has a follow up appointment with medical provider this week.

General sickness so far making work rough enough to try to call out for the 2nd dose coming.  Still ongoing.   Nausea, Difficulty concentrating, General achiness starting from arm to ribs, then body wide.  Brain Fog.  Heavy fatigue, but it doesn&#39;t take as much to disable me more.  Warm forehead, but temp taken today is normal at 96.6.   Difficulty moving with aches.  A few moments of wanting to vomit.  No allergic reaction or rashes.  Just a greater tax on the system.   I just thought it&#39;s bad enough to report (and is still going on).  Left arm pain all but done as of 3/15/21 at 7pm.  Nothing life threatening, but concerned over second shot.  Strange yellow &#34;Floating oil&#34; runs and dark urine.

                                                Severe shaking to the point I could barely walk, talk, or function in general. In fact, had to end work conference call due to effects.  In desperation, I have my wife help me into a hot shower where I continued to shake violently for about 25 minutes.  My wife continued to monitor me to make sure I didn&#39;t collapse or pass out and continually ask if we should go to the ER.  However, after about 25 minutes the shaking subsided and I was left exhausted with some minor muscle pain due to shaking.  It was very difficult to breath during the incident, noticed my hands turning blue so I focused on deep breaths and staying calm to eventually stop it.

Over the next 40 minutes I needed to urinate 6 additional times, and my heart rate peaked out at 195 BPM, and BP of 139/84. My blood oxygen never went below 95. My hands and feet were extremely cold, but normal in color. After approximately an hour after I recorded the peak heart rate, my rate was 138 BPM. By about 8:45 AM, I was very close to mo normal heart rate and BP. I had no other notable symptoms other than the expected soreness at the injection site and a very slight headache.

We sat patient down to monitor and took BP and pulse rate (120/59 and 60). After a few minutes, patient stated he was nauseated and still feeling dizzy. We continued to observe patient and after a few more minutes he stated he was starting to have intermittent chest pain. We then contacted 911 to request assistance. While waiting for EMS to arrive, patient stated the chest pain was becoming more constant. At this time we also observed patient was very pale, sweaty, and his skin was cold to the touch. EMS arrived quickly and took over patient care, stablilizing him and then transporting him to the hospital. We have not received an update on his condition at this time.

                                                On Friday, 4/2/21, a client (49 yr old male) arrived to the 30 minute Vaccine Recovery lot after COVID 19 Moderna Lot# 020B21A administration at 11:40am. Patient had reported history of rash after taking both Cipro and Penicillin. At 11:55 am while pt was being assessed by vaccine recovery lot, pt reported sudden onset of involuntary movements and mild shortness of breath. The EMT called for the Vaccine Recovery Lot Medical Lead. Began assessing patient at 11:57 am, noting the pt was having involuntary movements of the upper and lower extremities every few seconds. 12:00 pm BP 152/98, pulse 65. Patient was alert and oriented with normal skin color.  Pt reported feeling anxious and &#34;maybe it is all in my head&#34;. Pt reported the blood pressure on scene was &#34; higher than my normal at 120s/80s. Pt denied any history of recent illness or other vaccines. Pt stated, &#34; I should have known something would happen, I had a premonition about this&#34;. Repeat vital signs at 12:32 pm BP 152/98 and pulse 65. Pt continued to have episodes of the involuntary upper and lower extremities lasting approx 3-5 minutes per episode. NP explained to pt that she could not allow him to drive with these movements and pt agreed to evaluation with EMS and transport to local ER for further evaluation. NP instructed to call for EMS. Call was made at 12:48pm and EMS/Fire arrived onsite shortly after. While awaiting Fire Department and EMS, pt reported to NP, &#34;I have a history of Aspergers Syndrome&#34;. Also NP spoke with pt&#39;s spouse who also agreed pt should be evaluated at local ER. He was transported to the local hospital.

                                                The night after the vaccination I developed a mild fever (under 100 F) and had a severe headache.  It lasted most of the night.  When I got up in the morning, both symptoms were gone and I assumed I made it through any side affects.  That whole day I felt great.  I had delayed my daily 7 mile run, which I normally do in the morning, to make sure the symptoms were really over.  So by 4 pm, still feeling great, I decided to go for that run.  I didn&#39;t run particularly hard or fast,  It was a relaxing, enjoyable run.  No issues.  When I got back home around 5:30 pm, I went straight back to my office to keep working.  I was feeling hot, as you would expect after a run, so I turned on the ceiling fan.  after about 15 minutes I started to feel like I was shivering from the cold, so I turned off the fan.  Within less than 5 minutes, I was shacking and my muscles were spasming uncontrollably.  It was similar to the couple of times in my life where I have gone into shock from an injury.  So I dropped everything and made my way as quick as I could to a very hot shower.  I was scared enough to ask my 17 year old daughter to check on me to make sure I don&#39;t pass out.  A couple time I thought about calling 911, but I didn&#39;t have my phone and I was afraid to leave the shower.  After about 20 minutes in the near scolding shower, I stopped shaking enough to where I decided to wrap up and get under a bunch of covers laying on the bed.  The shacking  completely stopped after 5 or 10 minutes in bed, but the fever shot up and I developed a debilitating headache.  I took Tylenol and eventually Excedrin Migraine to ease the pain.  The fevered stayed over 100 F most of the night (my normal temperature is a little above 97), and the headache remained but gradually declined.  By 7 am the this morning I was fine and I&#39;ve been fine all day.  The only reasons I&#39;m reporting this is because the shaking was very severe, at times I wondered if I was heading for a seizure, and, being a runner, I want to make sure there is not a link between severe reactions and distance running shortly after the vaccination.

Around 5PM I started to get light headed and then around 6:30 PM I started to get the chills really bad.  I took Dual Action Advil with Acetaminophen, 500 mg &amp; 250 mg respectively, at 7:00 PM.  The chills went away around 9:30-10:00 PM.  I woke up feeling ok but rested for the morning.  At 12:30 PM I went and hooked up my camper and moved it to a different location and that is when the symptoms started again.  Specifically being light headed, loss of all energy along with an upset stomach  and slight headache.

He also felt like having a fever but he did not. One week later, patient started to get painful blisters on his leg. He went to his doctor and was diagnosed with shingles. Patient was prescribed an antiviral and gabapentin for pain. It took a week for the pain to resolve and the blisters are now clearing. Patient heard from one of his friends that there have been some shingles cases that were reported with the Covid vaccines. So he called us to report the adverse event.

                                                The patient was very nervous prior to getting the immunization and stated that he had a fear of needles.  After receiving the immunization the patient  went to the waiting area to be observed. Approximately 5-10 minutes later he slid off the chair and hit  the back of his head. The observer alerted the staff and 911 was called. He appeared to have fainted and was unconscious for a few seconds. He opened his eyes and appeared to shake a little and sat up and began vomiting while 911 was on the phone. Paramedics arrived and tended to the patient and he refused further treatment.

                                                Sunday morning, around 12:10am, I started getting chills/trembling/body shakes and my muscles all over my body ached. I was so miserable all morning I couldn&#39;t hardly sleep and later that morning, I could hardly stand for more than 5 minutes. That lasted all of Sunday and I maintained a mild headache. I drank a lot of water all day and ate very little.  I thought it would pass by the next morning. At 2:30am Monday morning a 2nd wave hit me, I had more trembling/ body shakes, this time it lasted for a little over an hour. I woke up again and again through the night and in the morning I had a terrible headache and nausea and vomited to the point of dry heaving. I slowly drank water with electrolytes.  At around 6pm Monday, I am finally starting feel normal again and made a meal of eggs and bacon with toast and felt fine afterward. I have had no other symptoms since that day.

For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications were provided.  The patient remained in the vaccination chair for 5 minutes after injection and he reported feeling well and moved to the observation chair without any problems [~10ft].  After being in the observation chair the patient stood up and took 4-5 steps toward the wall and sat down on the floor.  The patient stated he felt dizzy and then became limp and slumped to the right side, his eyes remained open with dilation of pupil fixed at 2mm with no blinking noted.  The patient&#39;s breathing pattern became shallow and snoring sounds were noted. The patient did not respond when spoken to nor did he respond to soft shaking of the shoulders.  The patient began to demonstrate large jerky body movements similar to seizure activity. The seizure like activity continued for 3-4 minutes before the patient was able to become aware of surroundings and answer orientation questions. The patient was diaphoretic, pale, shaking of hands and arms, restlessness of lower limbs with frequent repositioning/twitching of legs.  EMS (emergency medical services) arrived to find the patient regaining stability. The patient reported to EMS that he is familiar with this type of response and declined to be taken anywhere.  Treatment medications were not reported.

Stated he felt weak and tired after receiving the second dose and has been feeling worse since. His friend brought him to the ER stating &#34;he didn&#39;t seem like himself.&#34; Admitted for acute cellulitis of Left lower extremity, altered mental status, and started on IV Vancomycin (4/19/21-4/22/21) and Levaquin (4/19/21-4/26/21). Baseline plt 74 at admission. Rivaroxaban 10mg PO QD was given 4/19/21 until 4/21/21. Plt count continued to downtrend during admission. Hematology/Oncology service consulted on 4/22/21 who initially suggested thrombocytopenia possibly due to infection or DIC. Yet, worsening thrombocytopenia despite improvement of infection and clinical status was noted. The etiology was then suggested to be Vancomycin induced thrombocytopenia, so Vancomycin was stopped on 4/22/21. Platelet count  Patient was discharged with p.o. prednisone and p.o. Levaquin on 4/27/21. Patient stated almost full resolution of LLE pain and redness. Plt count upon discharge was 51. Instructed to stop Rivaroxaban.  5/1/21:Patient presented to ER at Medical Center for Leg pain. US Doppler was negative and patient given Clindamycin IV 600mg in the ER and discharged with Bactrim 800mg qd to be continued until his PCP appointment.   May 5, 2021: PCP placed patient on Clindamycin for recurrent cellulitis.   5/14/21-5/22/21: Patient presented to Medical Center ER with worsening left leg cellulitis. Patient was afebrile with a normal wbc count. Upon admission, Plt count was 36. Patient was started on Linezolid 600mg q12h and Ceftriaxone qd. Antibiotics were changed later to Tefalo 600mg Q12Hto be started on 5/15/21. ID consult recommended Daptomycin given patient&#39;s thrombocytopenia. Patient was continued on Daptomycin throughout admission and upon discharge, patient&#39;s leg was almost back to baseline. Plt count was 138. To rule out other causes of thrombocytopenia, patient medications were reviewed and imaging was done in addition to labs drawn during this admission. See above for the labs. All alternative causes during this admission were ruled out.

                                                First 8 hrs tired weak temperature 102.7, back tight like it was fused and unable to move Nauseated like I had COVID all over again I was in bed Thursday through the weekend. I ended up with excruciating pain that landed me in the hospital for two weeks for extreme nerve pain to the point I can?t walk, sit or stand for long periods of time. I was given heavy doses of steroids, pain meds, IV fluids and met with a neurologist did multiple MRI?s and I?m left with severe muscle spasms and tremors the Drs can?t seem to understand why They said this is not related to back issues however they did a steroid back injection hoping it would help with inflammation and I was sent home after two weeks in the hospital. I?m at home and dear if my life doesn?t turn around I will lose everything.  I was a athlete with no prior previous existing health issues and now I can?t even leave my house without serious tremors and muscle spasms I?m on medication for seizures, muscle spasms pain meds and have a jacuzz I can?t even raise my leg to get into This ALL HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER I GOT THE VACCINE!!!! 1st dose I did have a bad case of COVID in December for the record.

                                                Post shot developed the following within hours:  head congestion, dizziness, nausea, brain fogginess, phlegm in my heart, headache, inability to fully concentrate to typical ability, major soreness in arm receiving shot, soreness developed in arm that didn&#39;t receive the shot with intermittent shooting pain at opposite arm shot sight as if being stabbed with a knife.  Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

Left arm swelled up to the size of a goose egg and I was unable to lift my left arm from my left side.  Low grade fever, body aches, eyes looked sunken in, felt exhausted. I felt like I had the flu. I missed three days of work after the second dose.    I took ibuprofen and iced the left arm and rested.  I never had a reaction to the influenza vaccination in forty years.  The first dose, I did not miss work. And the side effects went away the next day.

I forced myself to go to work.  I am a Registered Nurse.  The joint pain and aches increased throughout the day along with altered periods of chills and hot flashes.  Around 6 PM on the 29th is started feeling worse.   I felt like I was tachycardic.  I had my wife take my blood pressure.  My normal vitals are Pulse-50, BP 110/60.  When I took my vitals at 6:00 pm my pulse was 91 and my BP was 85/53.  Clearly an allergic reaction.  I had no difficulty breathing.  Finally, around 1:00 am on 1/30, my fever broke and my heart rate and BP returned to normal ranges.  My first vaccination was unremarkable with only a sore arm for three day.

                                                Narrative: Patient is a 49 year old man with past medical history of hypertension and kidney stones who presented with a chief complaint of word finding difficulties and slurred speech. Patient was last seen normal at 1230 pm on 1/21/2021. He got his covid vaccine and shortly after he developed a headache that was on both sides of his head. Felt like 8/10 pain. He then had difficulty with speaking - he didn&#39;t know what word to say so he would make a noise. He was on the phone, and that person recommended that he come to the ED to get evaluated.In the ED, a stroke code was called. BP 169/97. NIHSS 0. A CT non con did not show any acute bleed or any signs of a stroke. After the stoke code was ended, the patient has a headache severity 1/10 and did not have any word finding difficulties. Patient was non focal by the time that the stroke code was ended. In the setting of hypertension, a blood pressure of 169/97 on admission and fluctuating symptoms, most concerning on the differential is a TIA. Given his risk factors and episodic presentation, he will need to be worked up for a stroke. The differential also includes post-vaccination reaction vs complex migraine.

                                                Patient had moderna covid vaccine last week. Initially he had normal post vaccine effects - soreness in the upper arm, fatigue. Over the weekend those symptoms were practically gone. Then he developed severe pain in the arm at the site of the injection followed by nausea and sweats. He is soaking thru his clothes. Not eating much. No fever, cough, sob. Just feels bad.

I had a loss of appetite, nausea, and no energy.  My fever lasted for approximately 30 hours before subsiding.  I alternated Tylenol and Alieve during my time with fever.  On Sunday, February 7, I began having mouth sores and fever blister on my lips.  For this, I used Lysine, both tablet and lip ointment.

                                                Had vaccine and had a red spot and sore arm which went away after a couple days. Four days after the vaccine a blood vessel in my hand burst (I don&#39;t recall hitting it on anything at all). It puffed up about a centimeter and slowly went away over a few days. Then a little more than a week later the red spot came back and itched very badly and was sore again. It also faded after several days. then yesterday morning I woke up and my arm was sore at the injection site again only I started having the worst headache of my life that lasted 30 hours. I started shaking, sweating massively, I felt hot and cold at the same time, felt as if I had a very high fever but my temperature was 98.4 (totally normal). I was vomiting if I tried to eat or drink. I had severe body aches and EXTREME weakness throughout my body. My heart began to race at 150-160 bpm for several hours and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It has gotten about 50%  better in the past few hours and will hopefully continue that way. I&#39;ve never felt anything like it in my life. I need to know if it is safe for me to get the second shot.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

                                                Started with tightness of chest, (under the lower part of ribcage); sporadic hot flashes and dizziness; pulse going up to 95,( when normal is in the 60&#39;s).  Then sat down an hour later and almost immediately a deep tiredness.  got off work early, went home and had no other problems until I attempted to go to sleep.  Somewhere around nine o&#39;clock, I started getting muscle cramps so I went to the couch.  Shortly after, my right arm, (vaccinated arm) became extremely sore; shortly after, my total body ached; no relief from lying on my left, right, stomach or back; hurt to even sit upright.  Then, I started getting cold chills; which alternated with hot flashes and periods of nausea.  My mouth went extremely dry, so when I struggled to go use the bathroom, I would wobble my way to the kitchen and want to take a big drink of water, attempted to swallow two tylenol, gagged and started throwing up.  Went back to bed and started getting continuous headaches that would move to different places.  This happened the rest of the night and most of Thursday when most of the worst symptoms happened.  Was able to sleep Thursday  night and thought I was feeling better, until I stood up.  Today, I was not able to stand longer than one half an hour at any one point; had to lie down and rest while doing any kind of activity.  I haven&#39;t been able to keep anything down; either vomiting or diarrhea. Have been slowly feeling better with occasional headache.

The patient stated he wanted me to call 911 so I called 911 and the technician called a &#34;code&#34; over the pager. I went with the patient back to the vaccine booth and got him to take a seat. The patient then stated that he had an allergy to cashews. I retrieved the emergency kit. I asked the patient if he wanted me to give him the epi pen and he said no. He asked if we would page his wife as well. I gave the patient some water while asking how he was breathing. He said it was just difficult to swallow. He said he didn&#39;t have any trouble breathing  but was noticeably shaking. Management came to check in and then went to wait for the ambulance to arrive. The patients wife also called 911 from his phone. While they were on the phone the EMTs showed up. They carried the patient out to the ambulance on the stretcher.

It has been 6 or 7 weeks and the neuropathy is still there in both feet. I have met with PCP and Neurologist.  Neither can tell me why I have neuropathy, even after neuro tests. GBS usually comes and goes withing 4 or 5 weeks but I still think it may be GBS???

                                                Immediately after receiving 1st dose of moderna my arm began to have a burning sensation and become sore. The burning sensation expanded to my left armpit area over the next few hours and extended to left side of chest. It felt like streaks of burn extending out of armpit area.  Approximately 12hrs after receiving the shot (3am) I became extremely nauseated. I alternated between throwing up and diarrhea for the next three hours. During this time i also experienced a fever, chills, sweats, uncontrollable shaking and elevated heart rate. Today (3/19) I am dehydrated, lightheaded and dizzy. fever and chills are gone as well as nausea but heart rate is still elevated.

                                                I don&#39;t think that my reaction to the vaccine is super serious but it is perhaps worth noting if others are also experiencing similar symptoms. On the second day, I did have the expected arm soreness around the injection area on my right arm. That soreness faded by Saturday morning. However, on Saturday afternoon, I began experiencing some intermittent pain in my left kidney. I have had a few (3?) kidney stones since I was approximately 35 years old so it is a pain that I recognize almost immediately.  I kept my spider senses awake to see where it was going to go. About an hour later, I had intermittent &#34;flu like&#34; pain in my arms and legs. I had been up on a ladder painting a wall and I became a bit dizzy and decided to halt the painting project. The rest of the evening was kind of crappy. Intermittent headaches, leg pain, arm pain and left kidney pain. I took 1 Alleve tablet around 8pm. It didn&#39;t seem to do much. I took a second one about an hour later (according to the instructions you can take two for you first dose) and that seemed to do the trick! I slept like a rock and so far today, all of the pain is gone including the pain in my left kidney.  I have not taken any more Alleve besides the two that I took last night. Also, as of right now (2:44pm on Sunday 3/21), no kidney stone has passed. I have been urinating into a cup to see if one comes out. I cannot 100% say that any of these symptoms are related to the vaccine. However, being a Type 1 diabetic (since 1978) and the unusual kidney pain made me go, &#34;huh.&#34; That is why I am providing this info in the event that there are others who are experiencing similar symptoms that can be tied to the vaccine and what to expect. I feel completely fine now. Yay. :)

When that pain subsided during the second day after the shot, I started to get some swelling and pain in my left armpit. Discomfort was such that it interfered with my ability to sleep through that night. The following day (Day 3 after injection) the discomfort mostly subsided but still has not completely gone away. Currently on Day 6 after injection. No treatments or medications have been applied to alleviate the issue.

                                                After I got the shot, on the way home, I started feeling tingling on tongue and lips; had a metallic taste. I felt like I had allergies - I was a little congested - but the next morning, 04:00 am -  I was still congested - and was still breathing short and shallow. I get to work and I&#39;m open mouth breathing - not breathing correctly. It felt like my lungs were swollen on the inside and throat was swollen on inside. Couldn&#39;t palpate and feel it but just couldn&#39;t access the lower lungs breathing-wise. Started getting dizzy and couldn&#39;t think - from 05:00 am to 09:00 am - and I decided I couldn&#39;t work anymore. I went to headquarters and I couldn&#39;t talk from lack of breathing - would have to stop just to think or just to breathe. I drove by the clinic where I was got my vaccine and decided to go in - I was so dizzy and I realized I shouldn&#39;t be driving. They told me to get up and move and I told them I couldn&#39;t breathe and I&#39;m not one to say that but they called an ambulance that took me ER. (I was a LPN at one time so I wasn&#39;t anxious.)  And they told me it was anxiety - and they kept telling me to breathe. But it wasn&#39;t an anxiety attack at all. My heartrate was normal. I was shallow breathing. They gave me a paper bag to breathe into. That&#39;s it .I was there for a couple of hours. They had told me to rest. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten out of bed that morning - my body just didn&#39;t want to move. I felt a little better after a couple of hours and people helped me from there to get home. After that, I felt better - about 4 pm or 5 pm. Second vaccine - felt flu like symptoms for three days after. I still feel a little weird - my bones hurt and I&#39;m achy. Just not feeling right. Note: When I was in the emergency room - my hands were purple. Circulation was weird.They told me my oxygen levels were fine and that I just needed to breathe. It caused carpal tunnel in my wrist - I had nerve damage on that about three weeks - I have about 80 percent nerve damage from previous and so when something irritates it  - it takes a while to recover from it but I have.  I consulted with a doctor about the reaction to first vaccine before getting the second vaccine.

It was throbbing always, more painful to stretch the deltoid where the shot was given, and sharply painful if I used that muscle to lift my arm.  This continued until about 30 hours when it started to reduce in intensity until being gone about 60 hours (2.5 days) after the shot. -General lethargy:  started about 6-7 hours after shot.   Peaked about 24 hours.  Still able to get up and move around but very tired.  Gone at about 43 hour mark. -Body aches:  timeframes the same as lethargy.  Felt at worst like a bad flu. - Headache and lightheadedness:  Started about  2 hours after injection.  Never got really bad, but was fairly consistently there until about 36 hour mark. - Burning eyes: started about 7 hours after shot, was annoying and lasted until about 33 hour mark. - Coughing:  mild but distinct dry cough started about 18 hours after shot and lasted to about 30 hour mark.

Pain would be rated a 9 on a 10 scale.  This was not caused by any impact to my nose.  I was sitting in my chair and watching TV.  This lasted 5 minutes and then &#34;went away&#34;.  April 3, two days after shot, left index finger and left middle finger are shaking (still shaking and has been for last 6 hours).  This was noticed upon waking up and is still occurring.  I am fatigued.

                                                I felt one small tingle in my left hand (I am right-handed) and I had a funny taste in my mouth.  Later that night, after eating, I started feeling a tingling sensation in my arms and back. It seemed to get worse after I ate some oatmeal cookies cooked with flour shortly before bed. Early the next morning, the tingling developed into itchy skin on my back, shoulders, and arms.  I am not really breaking out and I am making sure to stay hydrated.  I am hypothesizing that the side effects I am experiencing may be due to consuming refined flour and refined sugars that my body cannot metabolize.  At least for now, I plan to stay away from refined sugars and flours until my 2nd dose of the Moderna shot.  Day 2: I woke up on my left side and the pinky and ring fingers on my left hand were asleep. I went back to sleep on my back and woke up with fingers on my left and right side asleep. As I got ready for work, I experienced trapezius muscle soreness.

Next day only the upper part of right arm was sore, although not as sore as the previous day. Still took Ibuprofen. The third day only a little sore around the injection site. After 4th day, soreness was gone. No longer took Ibuprofen.

                                                This is a 50-year-old male who got his first Covid vaccine last Thursday, April 8 and then he said on Saturday he began to feel weak and off balance.  He also began to feel tremulous.  He apparently said that on Saturday his right leg was shaking so bad he could hardly walk.  He denies any numbness but again feels off balance.  He has fallen down several times since Saturday.  He apparently went to urgent care and then was sent to the emergency department for evaluation.  His blood pressure was noted to be 194/130 on presentation.  He does have an obvious tremor in his left arm.  His significant other says that he at times had slurred his words.  The patient does not know what type of vaccine he received on April 8.  The patient due to these symptoms presents to the emergency department now for evaluation.  He apparently drinks about 8 to 10 cans of beer per day and has done so for an extended period.  He denies any loss of vision.  Patient was not a candidate for alteplase.  He was admitted on 4/12 and discharged on 4/14. Discharge medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, and losartan.

                                                Within 24 hours of 2nd dose I experienced tongue swelling and sores on my tongue.  Out of concern, I went for a covid test on 4/16. Results came back negative on sunday AM on 4/18. My tongue had gotten worse, and I was also now experiencing sinus pressure and ear pain. I went to the pharmacy minit clinic. They diagnosed the tongue pain and sores as thrush, and saw ear fluid. They felt there could be an infection going on. Nystatin oral suspension and Amoxicillin-Clav 875-125 were prescribed. About an hour after coming home, I started experiencing symptom  of Bells Palsy which progressed to fully affecting my right side of my face.  I saw my PCP on 4/19 and he confirmed Bells Palsy. Added Prednison 20MG and a Famciclovir 500MG, and order a blood test

                                                Got his vaccine, that evening he felt as if his face was on fire like a windburn.  The next morning had an incredible cold chill as soon as air hit him, bone shaking.  Then had cold chills/sweating with soaking of his groin area.  He can go to sleep with extreme chills and then wake up in a puddle of sweat.  He had a headache at first, took Tylenol and it went away.   Numbness in his foot like it&#39;s falling asleep, left hip hurting, left wrist pain.  Today both calves hurt./sore like workout burning pain.  Two days ago his father went to have bypass and was at the hospital with him, and walked painfully in but had difficulty hobbling along and was unable to walk back to his truck and had to borrow his dad&#39;s cane to be able to walk.  Yesterday he was going to cut the grass, knelt down to do something, and when trying to stand up was not able to walk due to the throbbing pain and had to use the cane again.  Also having swollen left ankle with discoloration.  The calf pain is extreme and throbbing, and the pain when he&#39;s not able to walk is in the calf.  The ankle has been swollen since Sunday, 4/18/21.  He spoke with the ICU nurse in the hospital and he told her about it and she grabbed his ankle and asked if he was sure he didn&#39;t have a blood clot.  He has not been able to shake the symptoms.  The issues with walking are intermittent, some days he can walk fine, the other days he has to use the cane.    He still continues with every day hot sweats/cold chills.  It&#39;s 74 where he is right now and has a sweatshirt on as he is cold.  Also the legs hurting, ankle swelling that he ices down at night but the swelling does not go away.  Feels like a hard knot in his ankle.   He has not sought any treatment for this at this point.

Reports feeling a &#34;crook in the neck&#34; the evening of receiving the vaccine. States he woke up the next morning, 4/14/21 with a very painful L arm, couldn&#39;t lift it and no strength.  Left arm is still painful and with reduced strength as of 4/28/2021. States arm is still swollen but has improved. Patient saw his primary care provider (not at our clinic) on 4/23/2021 and was given a shot of Toradol for pain. Patient also kept existing appointments with neurosurgery and pain management for failed back surgery. Neurosurgeon advised it could be nerve injury and that it will heal over time. Told patient that nerve in arm could be in a different location due to his history as a body builder. Patient states arm is better but still painful and weak.

                                                When I woke It felt like a inner tube was inflated around my waist really tight and locked up where my back is fractured and the upper earlier surgery hurt and itched from nerve I am assuming. It settled in to all my weak spots. Today I have no pain like that in my back but right leg function and reflexes are nonfunctioning with spasms.

This graduated to constant dizziness and cloudiness and severe shaking while outdoors.   Arrived at ER at about 10am  and &#34;room spinning&#34; vertigo began shortly after and at about 11am there was about 5 episodes of severe vomiting over about a 2 hour period.  Dizziness did not decrease until enough medication was administered to stop the vomiting and allow a dose of Meclizine 25mg PO to be administered and take effect and decrease the dizziness to barely manageable.  Left the hospital in this state at about 6PM.  Today is 4 days later and dizziness continues as manageable only with Meclizine 25mg every 8 hours.

He had no prior coronary disease. This operation was done for an enlarging aortic root aneurysm in the setting of Marfan syndrome. The right coronary was anomalous and needed vein extension for reimplantation. He recovered very well and was seen in our clinic on 4/23, with no unusual findings. He had a normal echo, EKG and DVT study performed.   On 4/28 he had his first Moderna COVID19 dose. on 5/1, he developed malaise, myalgias, painful lymph nodes, chills, and chest pain. He called my clinic and was instructed to go to the ER, but then felt better and didn&#39;t go. He was then found unresponsive later that afternoon and was pronounced dead on arrival of EMS.

                                                I received my second Moderna shot on Sun 05/23. Immediately following the injection I noticed that it was high on my shoulder and I showed my wife where the shot was given. I also felt a swoosh sensation down his arm when it was injected. Now I am in terrible pain and can?t move my left arm. The pain started maybe an hour after and increasingly got worst. I searched this online and learned about shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA).  It?s when the shot is delivered into the sub-deltoid bursa instead of the muscle.  I think this is what happened to him but I am not certain. I did consult with my primary care physician on Monday 05/24 and he recommended me to an orthopedic specialist.

This lasted into the weekend where I developed a severe headache for about 24 hours. After the headache subsided I continued to be fatigued with no appetite and dizziness. I&#39;m unable to be upright for long and am extremely restless at night. I can&#39;t sleep longer than a few hours before I wake up with my body feeling anxious.  This is day 8 and I&#39;m still weak and incredibly dizzy struggling to sleep at night.

                                                I had a significant reaction to shot 2. Fever type feelings, aches, pains, nausea, etc. I was in bed for many hours.  One of those symptoms on day 2 seemed to be a throbbing pain in my right knee and right foot. it seemed quite strange at the time.  By Tuesday morning - about 40 hours after the shot - when I felt well enough to move around I noticed that I had numbness in my right leg starting at the knee and working up the leg about 9-10 inches.  The numbness is only on the front of my leg and only in a strip about 3-4 inches wide starting about half way on the kneecap and working up the leg again about 9-10&#34;.  This numbness almost feels like the sensation after a dentists numbs the mouth for a procedure, like local anesthesia.  I just assumed it was temporary and would completely heal. It has not. I informed my primary care doctor and sent a follow up that it is continuing to manifest itself.   My leg is functioning normally and I have no other symptoms or issues - only the numbness in the leg in that one area.  Because this has gone on for so long I felt I should report it.

I had the following issues after my second dose (April 29, 2021):  Day 2 (April 30), 28 hours following injection, I experienced an internal feeling of ?jitteriness?, shortness of breath, and accelerated pulse. Pulse oximeter showed my oxygen saturation dropped to 92 percent (my normal is 98-99) and my resting pulse rate increased to 120 bpm (my normal varies from 66 to 75). Aforementioned symptoms subsided after 6 hours.  Day 3 (May 1) following injection, local swelling and pain in muscle at site of injection (upper left arm). Arm swelling and pain subsided by Day 7.) Day 4 (May 4), noticed two swollen lymph nodes (size of pea and small marble) near collar bone area of neck (same side as injection).  Day 31 (May 29), both lymph node swellings still exists (as of this reporting) though not as prominent.

I did take ibuprofen and Benadryl a few hours later around bedtime.  I woke up with  fatigue, lethargy and Covid fog (decrease mental acuity and lethargic).   I had symptoms for 4 days and symptoms started to improve.  I noticed my heart rate increased at 120 and would only decrease if I lay down.  I went to see a doctor who diagnosed me with POTS (posterial orthostatic tachycardia syndrome).   I was prescribed metroprolol 25mg once a day.

I was diagnosed with acute Pericarditis 8 years ago, after 4 days in the hospital and a couple of weeks of rest at home all of my symptoms had subsided and I have had no reoccurrence of this condition since.  Approximately one week after receiving my second dose of the Covid 19 Moderna vaccine I began to experience chest pain.  8 days post vaccination the chest pain was radiating into my Left shoulder and arm, I had significant pain on breathing and was extremely uncomfortable lying on my back and could not lie on my left side due to pain.   I went to the ER  on the evening of May 6th, they performed a chest x-ray, 2 EKG&#39;s as well as 2 separate blood work panels.   While I did relate my history of having pericarditis and that this pain was very similar to what I had felt before, they, of course, were more concerned on if I was having a coronary event.  The EKG and blood work showed I was not so I was simply sent home with a &#34;we don&#39;t know why your chest hurts but your are not having a heart attack.&#34;   After a follow up to a cardiologists almost 2 weeks later it was determined that it was more than likely a flare up of pericarditis but that it had subsided by that time.

                                                Tightness in chest.  Shortness of breath.  Sore jaw. Pain in left arm.  Called 911 and paramedic took EKG and informed me I was having a heart attack on the way to the hospital.  Once at the hospital they measured my TnT-Gen5 and the baseline was 2658 ng/L with another test taken an hour later showing 2873 ng/L which led to additional tests listed in box 19.  Final diagnosis was perimyocarditis and I received a prescription of Colchicine 0.6 MG to be taken twice a day for 6 weeks and then follow up with a cardiologist.

                                                1st shot of Moderna 3/15/21 and reaction was extreme sore arm, almost immobile for 2 days. Then fine. First shot hurt during injection perhaps too deep into muscle. Second dose I couldn&#39;t even tell she injected it. 2nd shot of Moderna 4/12/21 and flu like symptoms for about 12 hours. Then after about a month numbness starting in lower left leg, then also in left forearm, then in left side of face. This condition continues. Dr. has NOT determined professionally this was due to the COVID vaccine but there are suspicions because other possibilities like a brain tumor or Multiple Sclerosis have been eliminated and I have no previous issues of spinal or nerve problems, no health conditions that put me at risk for stroke.

                                                I experienced insidous onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations after approximately 2-3 minutes of inoculation.  This episode lasted about 1-2 minutes.  I was not expecting this having no prior history of adverse response to vaccines.  I also felt a flushing sensation in my head.   My breathing felt slightly more difficult.  No sweating, throat closure or itching.   I did not measure pulse and instead tried to breathe/meditate to bring it down.  I estimate it was about 140 bpm .  Breathing/meditation brought it down but it was still elevated when the nurse checked me after 20 minutes.  I remained onsite an additional 15 minutes until I felt well enough to leave but my heart rate was still somewhat elevated, about 20 bpm higher than my usual.   My heart rate seemed to fluctuate throughout the evening and my sleep was subsequently very poor.  I feel much better this morning, just the usual arm soreness after a vaccination.  I have reached out to my primary doctor concerning whether she feels this event would warrant my not getting the second dose or perhaps having a prescribed epipen on my person.  Having no personal history but a family history of severe heart disease (father had first MI at age 42, second at 44 followed by triple bypass and CHF) this incident with my heart rate certainly raised some anxiety.  I had a routine EKG done in June which was normal, I am a physical therapist and in good health.  I am hoping to have the next vaccine in a proper medical facility.   I have read CDC recommendations to not have the second shot if certain adverse responses are experienced and I am not certain whether this would qualify.   I have no history of adverse reactions to vaccines.    Considering the role of anxiety versus the insidious and nearly immediate onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations and persistent elevated heart rate for more than 12 hours, I feel this event was primarily driven by the vaccine.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

I have waves of Tachycardia and nausea. I had pretty bad diarrhea the first day and second day, this was also a side effect from the Celexa. The Tachycardia was going up to 130-140 .  Very much flu like symptoms, heart pounding, head pounding and very light headed. I was having trouble controlling BP when I stood up.  I felt feverish, I kept checking my temp but it was normal.  This went on for two day, I wasn&#39;t able to eat or drink liquids. I ended up going and getting a Covid test on Tuesday morning, I was feeling somewhat ok. Then in the evening all my same symptoms came back.  I spoke with a Dr. who informed me I was probably dehydrated. I almost went into the Emergency Room because my high heart rate and thought I was having a heart attack. I didn&#39;t due to high volume of Covid in the ER. I have a follow up meeting with my PA before my second dose to come up with a strategy.  The left side of my face started to get numb and the left side of neck. My neck started to get still and went to my jaw.

                                                I received shot in left arm.  I began getting sore in injection area which I expected.  At around 630 in the evening, I began to feel a sharp pain going down my left arm from middle of shoulder to the hand.  This especially happened when I raised my arm.  I kept my left arm down to side trying to slowly move it during the day.  I contact Hot line for Hospital and explained issues.  They described certain reasons but said that I could take Motrin.  I began taking Motrin every 4 hours.  The next day I was able to raise arm about half way. The pain became a dull and aching from shoulder to hand. I continue to take Motrin.

                                                My Left shoulder became red at the injection site and swollen.  I also have pain and stiffness going from the injection site all the way up to the base of my skull.  If I look down at my hands, my cell phone, the ground or even at a desk too long, the left side of my neck gets so stiff that it hurts to raise my head back up to normal height.  The muscles in my left shoulder and left side of my neck are so tight that it seems like I have been lifting weights for days.  I have not worked out in months.  Today is 1/23/21 and I still have the problem.   I also had a migraine headache for three to four days after the vaccine.

                                                I began with chills on Weds. morning around 10am that only got worse not matter what I did. My arm continued to hurt but I thought it was just the injection pain. I then began to exhibit a temperature (100.3) and to feel fatigued and had a bad headache by late Weds. afternoon and evening.(These symptoms were similar to those I suffered when I had Covid back at the beginning of August, minus the throat pain and breathing issues I suffered.  By that night my arm was throbbing and I had fevers that ran as high as 102.7 and suffered multiple night sweats. My wife noticed swelling in my upper left arm and on Thurs. I contacted my Dr. who directed me to take tylenol and apply ice to the swelling. Which I did all day Thursday. The fatigue, fever and headache persisted all day Thursday and my arm began hurting more. I began to notice discomfort in my underarm (left) and my wife (a nurse) noticed it was swollen (softball size), warm to the touch and extending into my left pectoral muscle. I began applying ice to this area also but it had no impact. Contacting my Dr. on Friday about the new swelling, she examined me on Fri. afternoon and prescribed me Cephalexin, Medrol Dose Pack steroid, and over-the-counter Clariton allergy medicine, which I began Friday night. My fever began to subside and by Sat. morning my arm pain began to lessen and some of the swelling went down. Now Sunday morning, the fatigue, fevers and headache have gone, and most of my arm pain in gone (still tender to the touch), I still have some swelling in both upper left arm and Underarm pit. Dr. feels this was and allergic reaction and recommends I do not get the second injection.

                                                Received 2 dose Wednesday at 4:00 PM. By then next afternoon (Thursday) my arm was sore particularly at the injection sight at my left deltoid, with some diffuse soreness shoulder to elbow laterally.  By that same afternoon and evening I had chills and aches and started to feel run down.  That evening my temperature was slightly elevated around 99.3 degrees.  Some chills and aches, and feeling run down persisted the next morning (Friday) , I slept most of that morning and until 1::00 PM.  Mostly felt better by that evening and fine by the next day (Saturday).  The arms soreness also subsided by Saturday. As a side not with my first dose 4 weeks earlier my only symptom was soreness at the injection site for 3 days (more significant than I have experienced with other vaccines, including the flu vaccine.)

                                                About 24 hours after receiving  the vaccine, I started with a dull headache (scale of 1-5, 5 being the worst, it was a 1), and onset of chills  (scale of 1-5, 5 being the worst, it was a 3 )and flushing. The chills lasted about 4 hours. About 36 hours after receiving the vaccine, I noticed swelling of my lymph nodes under my left arm.  (scale of 1-5, 5 being the worst, it was a 4) It is about the size of tennis ball, it is causing discomfort and hard to sleep. It is painful.  The flushing, headache and chills all went away.

I got my first dose on Jan 11, 2021, suffered light headedness the first day, and two days later, while at work I felt like I was going to pass out several times.  I also suffered low grade fever and swelling of my lymph glands in my throat.  I took my booster on Feb 8, 2021 at 1310, the next morning I was suffering nausea and overall malaise.  I waited until fever started to take alternating tylenol and motrin.  I was very weak, freezing to death, and fell asleep about 6 PM fully dressed with my coat on under covers.  I woke up at 9 pm, still feeling horrible, wondering if it was 9 am or 9 pm, and went back to sleep until 715 am this morning with body feeling like it was ran through a hamburger grinder, no doubt a result of the shivering yesterday.  I have not had fever today, but still feeling a little nauseous about eating anything.

I was down and couldn&#39;t function. I took Ibuprofen and tylenol - and it helped with aches and pains a little but not with tiredness and overall feeling bad. I took the 3rd and 4th off but went back to work on 5th although I was sluggish. Felt a lot better on Saturday.

I rotated taking Ibuprofen and Tylenol.  I had a COVID test on the 11th.  It was th12th when I went to the doctor. About January 14th is when symptoms went away. Had second dose of vaccine on February 2nd.

                                                I had a lot of the usual adverse events, but yesterday (a week after the 2nd dose) I got a very bad, burning rash, a raised, red area, on my brow, an area where I sometimes have dermatitis. It doesn&#39;t burn as much today but is still puffy and red. I think the vaccine supercharged (for lack of a better word) the dermatitis.

                                                I had previous neurologic issues due to cervical disc disease that resolved after surgery 5/2020. Interestingly, after dose 1 and again after dose 2 of Moderna in my right arm, I developed left hand pain (previous radicular symptom) and I developed shaking of my head from side to side (like a tremor of my neck musculature). After the first vaccine, the hand pain resolved in about a week. Same with the head tremor. After the second vaccine, the hand pain is present Day 4 post vaccine, the head shaking resolved Day 2 post vaccine. It seems my body&#39;s response to the spike protein is to trigger inflammation in previously irritates neuronal tissue of the peripheral nervous system, but possible spinal cord.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

Over the course of the next  6 hours, my blood pressure plummeted to 82/63. I countered this by intaking large amounts of salt, and ultimately took my Diltiazem and some Tylenol PM.  Around 3 am my blood pressure returned to normal and currently holding steady at 118/83,  I am monitoring it throughout the day, but it seems stable.

                                                patient was sitting in our lobby following covid vaccination when he reported he felt a little dizzy and thought he may faint, (patient was nervous for the vaccine prior to administration), I sent someone to grab a  ice pack and a bottle of water for him and while they were retrieving the ice pack he started to seize. Patient was breathing but unresponsive, stiff, and unable to blink, talk, or move for around 2-3 minutes.  Once the seizure ended I asked patient if he had a history of seizures, his answer was, &#34;not really&#34;. He drank some of the water and sat with the ice pack for a couple minutes and said he felt better. Color returned. Patient stated he felt nerves contributed more than anything and was feeling 100% better when he left. We had dialed 911 while patient was unresponsive but once he was able to talk again he declined 911 and stated feeling much better.

I had heated the room to about 80 degrees and was in bed under several blankets but still felt like I was freezing. This lasted until about 3 am when I finally fell asleep. I had to work noon to 8 pm on the 12th. I was exhausted, tired and cold (even though bundled up with sweater and coat) the entire day. About 10 pm I got the shakes again, but they were very mild. I still felt cold and couldn&#39;t sleep well. I felt like I had a hangover the entire day even though I have not had a hangover in 20 years.

                                                Same evening, 3/6 at about 2000 hours, got cold chills and the shakes. Felt exhausted and all muscles ached. The next morning 3/7 at approximately 0830, same effects as previous, but also a horrible migraine and vomiting. Took one 6ml injection Sumatriptan for migraine in opposite arm from Covid vax, no effect and no relief. 1300 hours, migraine was so intense, I advised my wife I would do a 2nd Sumatriptan injection and if it didn&#39;t work, I would need to be brought to the emergency room. 2nd injection was successful in relieving migraine approx 45 min after injection. Felt run down, but was able to go to work the next morning 3/8. Felt tired and run down on 3/8, but symptoms went away by late evening. This was surprising, since my first Covid vax dose 4 weeks prior didn&#39;t affect me as bad as this 2nd dose

                                                Got the first Moderna dose, 5 minutes later, my heart started raising, I got lightheaded, my hands cold, my throat narrow. Personnel took me to observation, my blood pressure jumped up to 204, my heart bit to 190, felt like that for 15 minutes, then my BP started to come down. They called an ambulance took me to the hospital, in the ambulance my BP came down to 170. Go to the ER, blood test ok, after two hours there BP came down to 130 they released me. FYI, 51 year old man, very active, I can run a marathon (26.1 miles) in 3:45, Im not diabetic, I dont take any medication, I dont have high blood pressure. Dont know what that  happened, no insurance, now waiting for a bill from the hospital, not to mention Im scared to death now taking the second dose.

I was only able to lift my arm above my head with assistance from my right arm. Eventually I was able to lift my arm without assistance and the same phenomena happened the third evening where my shoulder was frozen and immobilized.  The frozen shoulder has abated but there is still moving poi&#39;s of major swelling in the upper arm. There has been persistent but slowly abating symptoms of deep soreness, arm weakness and weak grip strength. Swelling persists in the upper front portion of left shoulder. I can not do extended tasks with the arm because it does not have strength nor stamina.

He has chills, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, muscle pain, fever, headache.  He has not taken anything for his symptoms, just wanting to sleep.     He is allergic to the flu vaccine and he told them that before the vaccine and they assured him that he was ok to get this.  He probably will not get the 2nd vaccine.

                                                On the 2nd day after receiving 1st dose of the vaccination, I developed a small case of hives that developed into blisters on my left foot near my toes.  This issue resolved within a week.    Approximately 2 1/2 weeks after receiving the 1st dose of the vaccination, I began to experience pain and stinging on my right arm and on my head/scalp on the right side.  This developed into a rash within 2 days of the pain, then began to blister behind my ear and on my scalp.  I also started to develop a rash on my back, similar to the issue on my scalp and behind my ear.  The pain and burning was progressing along with the increased presence of blisters,  I went to the Clinic on Friday, April 2, and referred to ER  - and was diagnosed with an outbreak of Shingles.  I was given Valacyclovir HCl to treat the outbreak.

After about 10 hours had an intense uncomfortable feeling all over my body like I had been drugged.  Started saying no stop to wife : I don&#39;t feel right.  Very weird sensation in head.  Wanted to lay outside in grass. Could not get comfortable.  Started raising left leg and hitting it against the floor.  Episode lasted about 90 minutes.

                                                Diarrhea about 6 hours after vaccination.  Feeling off much of the rest of the day.  Fever started about 15 hours after vaccination with chills and shaking followed by sweating.  Used Ibuprofen to bring fever down and it would break after a couple hours.  Then took Tylenol hours later in the morning to try to ward off the fever.  Fever returned when these wore off.  Had fever again yesterday afternoon and last night - again taking Ibuprofen to break the fever both times and Tylenol in the morning to try to head off the fevers.  Sluggish feeling and lots of body aches.  Not as bad as the actual COVID disease probably but reminiscent of those symptoms except not getting the coughing I had when I had COVID in October (I was sick for 3 weeks when I had it with fever over 2 weeks solid).

                                                I had a stinging sensation after the Moderna shot, like a bee sting.  I woke up two weeks ago and my arm felt like someone punched it really hard, like a Charley horse.  My arm went numb, fingers are tingling, and at the site of injection it still feels like a Charley horse. I couldn?t sleep for three days and family started getting worried. My brother took me to Urgent Care this last Sunday. The doctor at Urgent Care told me it looked like a nerve issue, prescribed me Gabapentin and told me to do a follow up with my doctor. I saw my doctor on Wednesday and he suggested I report my symptoms because he is going through something similar. He prescribed me a stronger dose of Gabapentin and I?m waiting to see a neurologist. I have been missing a lot of work and I wish I never got the shot.

                                                I experienced &#34;Moderna Arm&#34; on the day following the injection, but it subsided after a couple of days. Eight days later, though, it returned (swelling/redness/milder pain) -- accompanied by swelling in my right ankle and tightness/some tingling/mild pain in my right ankle/upper calf. I suffered a blood clot for the first time in each leg in early November; the more serious of the two was in the vicinity of my upper calf in my right leg. In December, I began to experience sensations in my right ankle that were similar (albeit more intense) to what I later experienced after my vaccine; the post-vaccination symptom in my right calf was also similar (but milder) to what I had experienced from the DVT.

I thought I was going to black out but did not, my daughter was with me so I know I did not actually black out.  Overall weakness, and fatigue like having the flu for the next 24 hours.   I did not seek medical attention at that time as I do not have a primary care provider.  I do intend on getting an appointment to be checked out as I cannot be certain this was due to the vaccine but I have never had this fainting feeling before.

                                                State opened Covid vaccines to 50 and over on Mon, March 22. I immediately scheduled my appointment for a first shot at a Dept of Health site near me for Wed, March 24. I had no immediate negative side effects. When I woke on Fri, March 26 and commenced my day of remote work from home, I noticed my left eye vision was blurry. I proceeded to work that day and continued my normal activities into the weekend assuming my vision would self-correct. By Sunday, March 26, my left eye vision was still noticeably problematic so I scheduled to see an optometrist whom I had seen before. I saw him at 12:15pm on Tues, March 30. After running numerous vision tests, optometrist let me know my vision loss in the left eye seemed to be the result of a stroke that had cut blood flow in the optic nerve and damaged my vision in the lower portions of the left eye. The center and upper portions of my left eye were generally unaffected at that time. He suggested I see my primary care physician to check for vitals, such as blood pressure and do other blood work, and more importantly see a neuro ophthalmologist urgently.   The next morning, Wed, March 31 I saw my PCP, who informed me my blood pressure was normal, requested blood work, and gave me a prescription for an MRI of my brain, with and without contrast. I am 6&#39;2&#34; and I weighed at 239, about where it has been for most of last 15 years. I also complained of pain and stiffness in my front right thigh and lower right back. She said if I didn&#39;t get an appointment to see a neuro ophthalmologist that same afternoon, she recommended I go to an ER. With the help of Optometrist&#39;s office, I was able to get an appointment that day with Dr., neuro ophthalmologist at 2:15pm on Wed, March 31. His office repeated numerous vision tests and confirmed the left eye vision loss (essentially the lower half excluding the center) and diagnosed it as a NAION - non arthritic ischemic optic neuropathy. With this diagnosis, there was no treatment, and I scheduled a follow-up for May 12. He said that my optic nerve into my left eye would slowly reduce its swelling over the next 6 to 8 weeks and in that time, my vision could remain the same, or improve. At that point, I didn&#39;t think it would worsen, but sadly that later happened. In addition to the the first MRI that PCP prescribed, Neuro ophthalmologist prescribed a second MRI of orbits, with and without contrast. He also suggested I begin taking a low dose Aspirin daily, which I did.   The next week, the blood work revealed a very slightly elevated cholesterol reading. I was told by my PCP on April 5 that this would normally not be considered as a problematic level of high cholesterol, but should be improved or lowered. The blood tests taken at Lab on Fri, April 2 revealed a LDL Chol, Calculated as 111, whereby &lt;100 was considered desirable range. Other than that, there was nothing of concern in my blood work. The two MRIs were done on April 9 and April 20, and did not reveal findings which doctors felt would have impacted my optic nerve swelling or had caused the eye stroke. Out of precaution, I scheduled to see a cardiologist on Tues, April 13. She recommended I start taking Crestor for cholesterol, and do a series of tests which I completed on Friday, April 23 - echocardiogram; holter monitor; transesophageal echocardiogram; and ultrasound carotid bilateral. As of today, Mon, April 26 I do not know the results of the cardio work-up, but both neuro ophthalmologists I saw felt that a problem related to my heart would not have caused this stroke in my eye.   Finally, on Fri, April 23 I had a consultation with a second highly recommended neuro ophthalmologist. After a series of vision tests, she agreed with other doctor&#39;s diagnosis of NAION - non arthritic ischemic optic neuropathy. She also said there was nothing I could do to treat except wait for the next 4 or more weeks for the optic nerve swelling to go down. She also confirmed my fear which was that my left eye vision had worsened since March 31 as my vision loss was no longer limited to the lower portion of my left eye, but now included blind spots throughout the upper range of my left eye vision, making my loss of peripheral vision worse and more widespread. She said in some cases with NAION, a patient&#39;s vision could remain the same, could improve or could worsen in the 6 to 8 weeks after the event. Four weeks after the March 26 event, by April 23 my left eye vision had worsened. I still hold out hope that it can improve some in the next four weeks... My right eye vision was not affected in any way, although one risk of NAION is that there is a 20% (?) chance it may recur in the next 5 years, and if it does, it most commonly affects the other, good eye.   None of the doctors I saw directly attributed my vision loss to the Moderna vaccine taken on March 24; however, there has also not been a clear cause determined by my doctors. While most of the doctors I saw seemed to think it coincidental, none also was able to absolutely rule it out either as a cause or a trigger. Dr. suggested I follow through with this idea, which other medical professionals suggested, to submit this vaccine adverse event report. Without a doubt, this was an adverse effect and/or problem that occurred soon after (36 hours approximately) taking the first dose of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                I had ?normal? side effects from vaccine starting 20 hours after shot. I would say it was on the severe side. 40 hours after the shot the maxillary zone of the left trigeminal nerve turned exactly that portion of my face numb. I?ve had trigeminal neuralgia for 22 months but never this symptom. I am convinced there is a correlation here. I didn?t go for any treatment. The numbness went away after 10 hours. Just thought someone should know.

His blood pressure at the vaccine clinic was noted to be severely elevated (patient was on blood pressure medication in the past but was taken off of it a while ago). Patient drove himself to the ER and stroke alert was called. Patient needed nicardipine drip and labetalol pushes to bring down blood pressure, and once it was controlled patient was given alteplase.

                                                Bell&#39;s Palsy; lethargic; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of BELL&#39;S PALSY (Bell&#39;s Palsy) in a 51-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 025a21a) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 06-Mar-2021 at 11:30 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 07-Mar-2021, the patient experienced LETHARGY (lethargic). On 07-Mar-2021 at 12:00 PM, the patient experienced BELL&#39;S PALSY (Bell&#39;s Palsy) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 08-Mar-2021, LETHARGY (lethargic) had resolved. At the time of the report, BELL&#39;S PALSY (Bell&#39;s Palsy) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Patient began to experience paralysis of the facial muscles on the left side of his face along with lethargy that lasted one day. He was unable to blink his left eye and the left half of his tongue had no taste. He also reported blurry vision.  He subsequently called 911 and was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy in the emergency room that evening. That week, the left side of his face was drooping. He reported that it had tightened up and was more symmetrical now, however, he was still unable to smile, frown or blink from the left side of his face. He was scheduled to receive his second dose of the vaccine on 06-Apr-2021, however, his neurologist stated that she could not guarantee that it would not make his Bell&#39;s Palsy worse, but she still recommended getting the second dose. The medical staff at the base didn&#39;t know if he should get the second dose and his civilian doctor wouldn&#39;t commit. The emergency room physician contacted an Infectious Disease doctor who felt it would be fine for him to get the second dose.  Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.

I tool Tylenol as directed it would only reduce temps to 101 after 2 hours the fever 104 would return. This lasted until late morning the next day my temps started to fall off to 99. Tiredness and headaches still a problem been 3 days since the Moderna 2nd vaccine shot. I also feel some inner ear pressure like some inflammation in there.  The headaches seem to be getting somewhat worse causing me to feel nauseated I took 500 MG of Ibuprofen seems to reduce the headaches. I also developed a cough dry but almost like a flu cough which seems to be resolving.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Glaucoma and Hyperlipidemia.    On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 06-Mar-2021, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant) and BULBAR PALSY (Bulbar weakness) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY (demyelinating neuropathy) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), ILEUS PARALYTIC (adynamic ileus) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Progressive Extremity Weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), ASTHENIA (Weakness) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (trouble walking). The patient was hospitalized from 06-Mar-2021 to 31-Mar-2021 due to ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE, BULBAR PALSY, DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY, ILEUS PARALYTIC, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS, PNEUMONIA and RESPIRATORY FAILURE. At the time of the report, RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Respiratory failure), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure), PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia), DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY (demyelinating neuropathy), BULBAR PALSY (Bulbar weakness), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Progressive Extremity Weakness), ASTHENIA (Weakness) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (trouble walking) outcome was unknown and ILEUS PARALYTIC (a dynamic ileus) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 15-Mar-2021, Electromyogram: abnormal (abnormal) consistent with demyelinating neuropathy.. On 30-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) Negative.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications reported by investigator.  Patient was presented to hospital on 3/6/21 with progressive extremity weakness, bulbar weakness, and respiratory failure attributed to AIDP s/p 5days IVIG. He had received his first Moderna COVID vaccination approximately two weeks prior to this and immediately following administration began experiencing weakness and trouble walking. EMG 3/15/21 consistent with demyelinating neuropathy. Hospitalization was  complicated by the development of adynamic ileus which is improving and acute hypoxic respiratory failure (previously requiring O2 support). Patient was also treated for pneumonia with a 5 day course of azithromycin. Once medically stable he was deemed appropriate for inpatient rehabilitation and was transferred from Hospital to rehab on 3/31/21 under care. The patient tested negative COVID-19 on 3/30, and repeat testing since also has been negative.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose, I spiked a fever of 101, felt body aches and chills. This lasted for about 1 day. On day 3, I woke with stiff, achy and sore joints in my right hand. On day 4, these symptoms remained in my right hand and moved to my left. Over the next week, stiff joints moved into my toes. EXTREME FATIGUE and mental fogginess also developed as did blood pressure spikes. On week 2, move joints started aching including knees, elbows and shoulder. On week 3, my fingers were so sore and stiff it became difficult to use door knobs. I contacted a virtual doctor to ask for direction. He assumed in was side effects and prescribed me Diclofenance Sodium 75 mg for pain. Two days later, I went to the emergency room as the pain, fatigue and fogginess was becoming very concerning. On week 4, I was finally able to see my family doctor. He assumes it is a overactive immune response to the vaccine and prescribe Prednisone 20 mg to overcome the symptoms. The course of Prednisone has decress the severity of my symptoms but on week 5 I continue to have stiff, painful joints, mental fogginess.

This spread to involve pain throughout the posterior upper arm for about 6 days before resolving. Did get moderate relief with use of ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q 8 hrs PRN. Received vaccine on 12/23/20 at 6pm.  Woke up at 5am to go to work on 12/24/20 and felt flu-like symptoms with subjective fever (did not measure), joint pain, and diffuse myalgias.  Symptoms progressed over the next three hours and culminated in about half an hour of significant rigors with uncontrolled shivering.  Ibuprofen dose of 600mg orally did help symptoms enough to allow me to finish my shift but I needed two more doses every 8 hours before symptoms resolved in 24 hrs.

                                                So basically I believe I have Bell&#39;s palsy  .  After about an hour after receiving the vaccine I noticed I was having a weird taste in my mouth. Sort of a metallic taste. As the weekend went on it seemed to get worse. Then Monday morning I noticed when brushing my teeth that I wasn?t able to  gurgle my mouth wash. And saw that my mouth and eye seemed to be drooping slightly. Now Thursday the 21st and it seems to be effecting my speech to were I now have a lisp. Can definitely see it when I?m speaking to someone. Which people have commented on.  Not sure what can be done . But at this point I?m hoping it doesn?t get worse. Thanks

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Standard immune response to vaccine: within 7 hours I developed diffuse myalgia, fatigue, low grade fever (temp 99-100), headache. On Jan 22 (the next day) the myalgias were almost debilitating. Ibuprofen and tylenol did help but I was rendered immobile for about 24 hours. Today I only have a sore arm and mild headache.

                                                The evening of 1/11/21 - pain at the injection site and feeling of fatigue - went to bed very early.  Arm pain a bit less next day - felt a little tired all day. Back to &#34;normal&#34; on the 13th.   I am not sure if the following symptoms are related to the vaccine but I feel like I should report them if there may be a link.  1/17/21 -Awoke in the morning with severe neck pain - muscles &#34;locked up.&#34;  Called the doctor - he prescribed Tramadol and Cyclobenzaprine - I took these for two days before my neck calmed back down and I could function &#34;normally&#34; again.  1/28/21 - Started feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; and tired late in the day while still at work.  Went home and went to bed early.  1/29/21 - Felt same as last PM upon waking up.  Felt much better by mid-morning.  Started feeling bad again later in the day.  Felt cold - but no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  1/30/21 - Felt bad all day.  Felt cold - no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  AM - felt anxious, worried, confused.  Built a fire in the fireplace and heat made me feel better. Felt hot-cold-hot-cold- all day.  My neck ached all day.  Sensitive to sounds. Took a single cyclobenzaprine late in the day - seemed to help. Went to bed early.  1/31/21 - Woke up with very sore deltoid muscle at the site of COVID-19 injection. Very hard to lift arm above head.  Hips, back, and neck muscles ache.  Calf muscles feel almost like they are about to cramp.  Mental state better than yesterday. Still sound sensitive. Not as cold feeling as in days prior.  Yoga seems to help.

Day 2: Next morning was difficult getting out of bed. Skin was very sensitive to warm/hot shower water. Achy joints all over. Even my left injection site was sore even though I was injected on the right side. Fatigue at work. I was very wide eyed as described by co-worker. I was a little loopy as I was very giggly and things made me laugh way more than usual. I may have been a little delirious but I was able to work. This lasted until I went to bed. Day 3: When I awoke I felt like a fever had broke, Cooling sweat, but my temp was never over 98.5 degrees. My normal morning temp is usually 97.3 every day, but that one degree made a difference. I feel normal today and realize I was not well the day before.

By the following morning, I felt that skin area, as well as the area around both of my eyes to feel as if I had sustained second degree burns. Additionally, the skin around my eyes particularly, presented with extreme dryness and geriatric symptoms, such as wrinkling and streched thinned skin, as if I were an elderly person (over 75 years old, and not 52).  The flaring/burning subsided after 4-5 days. However, the skin dryness around the eyes has persisted to this day (i.e. 5 weeks past the 1st vaccination). A day after the 2nd part of the vaccination, I felt moderate dizziness and headache, which lasted for about 24 hours. Also, light soreness and skin stiffening were experienced at the arm location where the shot was adminmistered.

I advised him to go to er/call dr if unable to drink, develops high fever/numbness/tingling/loss of motion, etc.  Followed up today. pt is still very nauseated but has developed a full-on  migraine headache.  He went to the ER last night, and was not found to be dehydrated &amp; labs were not unusual.  he was given injection of nausea medicine, and rxs for zofran and norco, but had not taken any today... using pepto bismol instead.  I advised he take the zofran routinely until the nausea subsides and the norco for the headache  &amp; if not improved in a couple days to go see his dr.

Received the second shot the morning of 18 Feb, noticed some minor joint stiffness, minor pain and tiredness mid morning 19 Feb. Laid down at 16:30 and remained asleep until 0530 the next day. Unusual to sleep 13 hours. Later that weekend I noticed a bruise on my leg. I rarely bruise and had not hit my leg on anything. I ignored the bruise a couple weeks, but as it did not heal, continued to hurt and had swelling I went to my primary doctor on 4 March who thought it was a blood clot and sent me for imaging. They determined it was superficial thrombophlebitis and treated with antibiotics and heat.

                                                Patient did say before vaccine that he has fainted in the past from previous vaccines. I had a Representative administer vaccine while i stood next to patient and talked with him as a distraction from the shot. After Representative gave the vaccine patient asked &#34;did you give vaccine?&#34;, he then immediately started to sweat very hard and said he was light headed (he was sitting down), then his eyes rolled back and he slouched down in chair, at which point I held him so he did not fall on floor. He started to jerk and twitch, perhaps was having a seizure, and was sweating very hard. I held him in chair so he would not hit his head or get hurt. After about 30 seconds he regained consciousness and asked how long he was out. His T-shirt was soaked in sweat and he said he felt very dizzy. The Representative got him an ice pack and placed at base of neck, which he said helped alot.  I sat with him for 10-15 minutes until he said he felt fine. I asked if he needed medical care and he said he did not, just needed to sit for awhile, and said this has happened before. I gave him a chair to sit in after he was fully alert and he sat for close to half an hour, at which point he said he was back to himself and felt fine.  I did offer he could stay as long as needed and I could call anyone if he needed me too, he insisted he was fine and after about 45 minutes he left. I did call him the next day to check on him and he said he was fine.

After going to sleep early in the afternoon I woke up light headed. I spent the weekend having trouble breathing. On Monday I used a sick day because of shallow breathing. Tuesday my light headedness went away but I was having trouble with my bowels.  That may have been due to snacking on cashews though. Tuesday night I ate some watermelon and drank two 32 ounce bottles of gatorade and I feel a lot better today. Breathing is still shallow but nowhere near what it was. It is back to being indicative of my morbid obesity

                                                Arm became warm and sore within seconds.  After about 90 seconds, a wave of heat flashed through the entire upper-body (torso, arms and head) followed by a mild tingling sensation throughout the entire upper-body (torso, arms and head). From minutes 3-6, increasing stomach discomfort and queasiness. From minutes 5-7,  profuse sweating of the entire head (everything from the neck up). At approximately 7-8 minutes, there was a single dry heave or gag (the sensation of vomiting, but nothing came up).  Other than the sore arm, all symptoms disappeared almost immediately after the dry heave occurred. There have been no symptoms other than continued soreness at the injection location as of 24 hours later.

                                                4 days (4/20/2021) post vaccination pain in right calf was experienced. As the pain did not resolve over the next week and felt similar to a DVT experienced post a spinal fusion in 2018 I consulted, on 4/16/2021, with the vascular surgeon, who treated my post surgery DVT in 2018 . He performed an ultrasound and identified a clot in my right calf. On 4/21/2021 he prescribed a course of Eliquis (initial dose 20 mg per day) to resolve the clot. As of today (4/23/2021) the pain has lessened but not resolved. In addition to the DVT I experienced a significant level of fatigue for 3 days post the vaccination. While the fatigue has lessened it has not completely resolved.

                                                After my second Moderna vaccine ,  I developed Bells Palsey on the  right side of my face, and some on the left. I went to Medical Center and saw one of the providers  (it was a Saturday) who did a neurological exam and was 99% sure it was Bells but wanted more testing and caution. He sent me to Hospital where I went into the ER and they were expecting me. I was there about 4 hours or so, and had a bunch of tests. I left with a prescription for Prednisone and Valacyclovir, which is an anti-viral.

                                                Within 2 minutes after COVID vaccine first shot I felt a flushing sensation and began developing heart palpitations. It lasted about 5-8 minutes. I sat down for 15 minutes as required by the clinic for all those getting shots.  After about 8 minutes heart stopped racing and slowly got back to normal.  It did not appear to be caused by anxiety. I did not report it to the clinic staff.  In researching this allergic reaction is likely related to Polyethylene Glycol allergy.  When I got a colonoscopy a few years ago I used colo prep.  Back then my heart was pounding hard the night before and the day of the examination.  I did not know it was a side-effect from the solution.  Doctors could not explain why my heart rate was high but went ahead with the exam. With the current event it appears is the common link between then and the COVID vaccine.

                                                March 3 I became very ill. Lethargic and had flu-like symptoms. Over time began having neurological symptoms including short term memory loss and numbess and tingling in the cheeks as well as shakey arm and hand on right arm only.  Symptoms on face started and right and have moved over to the left side of the face. Continued memory issues off and  on. Memory issues include getting lost while driving and inability to spell. Basic confusion at times. Again these symptoms come and go on a daily basis.

With in 15 minutes he had 2 waves of this reaction. The 3rd wave started about 20 minutes after shot and he said it was worse, tingly in both hands , funny feeling like he was going to faint , cold and felt like his pulse rate was up . He never fainted. He kept talking to me. Since the 3rd wave  was worse and it lasted the longest, we call 911. They came and checked him out, but he declined to go with them to the hospital. He waited in the store for at least 1 hour. Checked on him at home at 3:05p.m. and he said he felt fine.

                                                On Saturday, January 30, 2021 I began experiencing an altered sense of taste with a metallic taste all through my mouth and tingling in my mouth.  I mostly felt ill throughout the day with low-grade fever, fatigue, body aches.  This continued on Sunday, January 31, 2021 and Sunday evening, I noticed a small droop in the upper lip on the right side of my mouth.  When I awakened, Monday, February 1, 2021, I had full right-side paralysis of the face, severe right eye, right jaw and right ear pain, severe fatigue, continued body aches.  After going to the ER where tests were performed to rule out stroke and sepsis, I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy.

At 3:45pm, I started getting a headache that started at the base of my skull and worked upward. I took two Tylenol at that time and it dulled it. At 7:30pm that evening, I got the chills, I covered up with four blankets and finally went to sleep. I woke up the next morning at 5:30am and felt fine except for a sore arm where the injection was given. The sore arm lasted about two days.

                                                I had a really bad day after the second dose. Horrible migraine headache that built as the day moved on.  As a rule, I do not get migraines and whenever I have gotten a headache I&#39;ve not had a  sensitivity to light or sound, like I did yesterday.  It was just miserable. Lots of body ache and a generalized feeling of sickness, similar to influenza or food poisoning.  I had no energy.   My arm at the injection site hurt constantly without even being touched all day and I could not sleep on my left side due to arm pain around the injection site. The arm pain from the injection site, occasionally radiated to my elbow joint , depending on how I moved my arm.  It is still sensitive today, two days later, and has a sensitive swelling in the area where the injection occurred. I do not feel bad today, but I do feel like I am 100% yet, either, but I feel a LOT better than I did yesterday.

The next day his symptoms got worse so he took Benadryl since he thought he was having an allergic reaction but he continued to get worse.  The third day his speech was getting worse, his face continued to swell and droop and he still had severe headache on the left side.  Pt ended up going to the ER where they did a CT, EKG, Chest X-Ray, blood work, gave him IV fluids and steroids. The ER Dr. consulted a Neurologist which told him he had the symptoms of Bell Palsy so they did the stroke protocol but ended up telling him his symptoms were from taking the Covid Vaccine.   He was told to finish his medicine that they prescribed which is steroid and antibiotic and if he did not get any better to come back for FU.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

                                                At 5:00 pm on vaccination day I started to experience aching in both legs.  By 5:30 pm the aching in both legs became greater and started a general unwell feeling.  By 7:00 pm I had a headache/full body aching/major pain and aching in both legs/rapid heart beat at rest/chills/diarrhea.  I suffered from sweats/chills/rapid heart rate/major right and left leg pain and aches/headache for the whole next day.  By 11:00pm the day after vaccine, I was only suffering from major head ache and major left and right leg pain and aching and sweating.  I woke up the 2nd day after the vaccine symptom free but very fatigued.  I took 800mg of Advil every 6 hours from the onset of symptoms.  My watch reported my heart rate at a range from 90-121 BPM while at rest for at least 24hours during onset of symptoms.

Left arm at injection site sore.  Details:  approximately 1 am I woke up with chills, headache, earache and tiredness.    I took Tylenol and this continued waking up again a few hours later the same.   Eventually I felt very hot.   Upon waking again tired/fatigue, headache, earache.   At approximately 11:30 am I got out of bed,  shaky &amp; very tired.   I eventually felt better, just tired.   (With exception of Arm still hurting).    Please note I had Covid in December and had similar symptoms, except these all hit me at the same time and felt much worse then when I had Covid.

                                                I had only a sore arm until about 14 hours second shot.  Became chilly, achy, and fever 100.6.  It was like one second I was fine and next it hit me all at once.   I drank a lot of fluids, mainly Pedialyte and chicken soup.   My temp hovered between 100.5 and 101.6 most of the day.   Around 7PM, it went to 102.4 and I took one 500 mg Tylenol.   That brought it down to the mid 100?s.  I took another 500mg Tylenol at midnight.    This morning, about 24 hours after my 2nd shot, I still have a slight temp of 99.4 but no aches.

I am currently taking Valtrex (1GM tab 3xs/day)  and Prednison (1 50mg/day), plus eye drops.  I woke that morning having trouble drinking and eating and when I looked at my face, could see that something was wrong.  My face (left) has not gone back to normal and my left eye is watery and seems sensitive to light.

                                                I tested positive for covid on 1/08/21. I had the Moderna vaccine 1st dose 4/12/21 at 8:30am. No significant immediate reaction to the vaccine. Pain worsened at the injection point, but never significant, slight headache, tired, mild flu symptoms grew through the day. At 9:30PM I experienced Fever(101.6 at around midnight after fever had broke was probably higher between 9:30PM and 11:30pm). I experienced chills and violent shaking from approximately 9:30pm to 11:30pm, as bad or worse then the original covid from January. I was unable to sleep and finally took 2 Advil 200mg each at 3:00am. Advil helped and eventually fell asleep around 3:30am. Online information suggests that the 2nd dose generally has more severe reactions. I am concerned how much worse it will be and considering not getting the 2nd dose scheduled for May 10. Tuesday April 13 I experienced slight headache, body aches and exhaustion in the afternoon. Took Nyquil  severe cold and flu Tuesday evening and sleep well. Wednesday experienced lesser symptoms. Thursday had lower back and kidney area soreness. Friday april 15 back to normal.

The perfect way to describe it: after you have been to the dentist, and the novicane shots starts to wear off.  The tingling/almost pins and needles. feels kinda warm. I had this sensation all day.  I woke up the next morning and felt fine, until I had a cup of coffee, and it came back.  It lasted like this until about noon on the second day.  Now that sensation (tingling) is gone, but my left cheek/face feel tender.  (Like a dentist was stretching my cheek a day ago, while doing work on a tooth).

He went out side for a little bit, his body temperature was still hot without chills and this lasted for 3 days and night. I talked to the pharmacist and he recommended Ibuprofen and I gave it to him for two days but he kept the fever. He started shaking and by the 5th day I took him to the clinic and both his eyes were red and hands and feet were hot. I was told to take him home because all vital signs were ok, but I took him back to the ER on day 8 because he was not getting better, they said he had multi organ issues and now he&#39;s confused and he doesn&#39;t know who I am or where he is and cannot remember and confused. He is now on dialysis and he was on life support, he was never hospitalized or taken prescription drugs and now he&#39;s in this condition. He is still in ICU and his body looks so weird.  He don&#39;t remember words or when I talk to him.

                                                The following is an email the patient wrote to us describing his events:  I received Moderna Covid Vaccine on January 4, 2021 and February 1, 2021 at Medical Center in  On the evening of January 12, 2021, I arrived home from working as a Pharmacist following a 13 hour shift at Medical Center with no medical complaints.  Later that night I experienced a severe coughing, sneezing episode where I was gagging on the mucous. I spit out a bunch of stuff and did a nasal rinse. I took some cold medicine like Certrizine and Mucinex-D.  Simultaneously with the coughing episode I developed a tingling sensation on the right side of my body from my neck to my toes. I also noticed that my temperature sensations on my right hand was different from my Left hand. I had gotten a water bottle from my refrigerator that felt room temp to my right hand but was cold when held in the left hand. I was feeling dizzy or drunk and was walking funny. When I tried to walk straight forward I actually drifted to the left as I walked. I was having difficulty swallowing medications, food or liquids.   I wondered if was experiencing the onset of Covid Symptoms. I was well enough versed on stroke symptoms to be worried about one sided tingling and altered gait being from a stroke.  The flu like nasal symptoms and altered right sided pain and temperature sensations persisted through the night, so I went to the ER at Medical Center the morning of January 13th. The ER worked me over with multiple Covid/Strept/Flu tests, evaluation for possible stroke (with multiple scans and stroke score.) The ERP also evaluated the possibility of Bells Palsy or Guillain Barre secondary to Covid vaccine the week before.  The Covid Testing was Negative. The stroke score was low enough NOT to have warranted thrombolytic therapy. The neurological issues did not appear to be Bells palsy or Guillain barre.   After the ER Visit I attempted to see a neurologist. May 25, 2021 was the earliest available appointment that I could obtain. The symptoms were not severe enough to prevent me working as a Pharmacist. The altered pain and temperature sensations remain without much improvement even now 4 months later.  The Neurologist diagnosed me as having had a stroke, specifically left sided Lateral Medullary Infarct, also known as Wallenburg Syndrome.   There have been reports from the other vaccines having caused blood clot issues since my event.

                                                It&#39;s called foot drop. What happened is that from the tips of my toes to the top of the arch of my foot and around to the left of my ankle went numb and I had no control of the muscles. This started two days after. So when I was walking when I moved my foot forward my toes would curl under because I had no ability to keep my foot up and ended up tripping. So that was the situation. On the the wen 29th I saw a GP. On the 30/31st I saw a Neurologist. They ran a battery of tests and established the fact that the nerve was a bit like a water hose that was folded and not allow water to flow. It wasn&#39;t a stroke or blood clot but there was some crimping of the nerve slowing the communication from my knee to the lower part of my foot. They told me I may have been the 1st case only happening in one leg.

                                                I got my second shot of mederna on april 2  at about 130 pm, I got the shot and felt fine for about 4 hours at which time I got so tired and dizzy I felt like I was going to pass out, so I stopped what I was doing and went to bed. I slept for 4 hours and woke up in a pool of sweat and was so wet it was like I had just gotten out of the shower. I had the chills and felt cold in 84 Deg F, I went down stairs drank power aid and got out and set up a space heater and sat in front of it with it blowing the hot air on me but had hot and cold flashes, a mild head ach and joint stiffness and pain. I was only able to stay up for 4 hours before I was so exhausted I had to back to sleep and woke up the same way, this continued for the entire weekend. By monday morning my urine was so yellow it was almost black in color, I called my PCP office, they called me back and advised I go to the emergency room asap. I called my parents and got a ride to the hospital emergency room. I told intake what happened and sat down to be called in, they called me in 1 time then had me wait for diagnostic testing, I got vary dizzy just sitting their watching the tv. By the time they called me in for testing I told them I felt vary noxious and ended up passing out on the nurse after they took my blood. They transferred me from that chair to a bed in the blue pod, gave me nausea medication and hooked me up too 2 vary large IV bags and ran them at the same time. Then being up for 4 hours then sleeping for 4 hours and waking up wet in a pool of sweat continued for 6 days in total. the hot and cold flashes and sitting in front of a space heater went on for 12 days in total. waking up in a pool of sweat went on for about 28 - 30 days in total decreasing in severity along the course of time. The only side effect I still have is my sleep is all screwed up now. If I stay up untill 4 am I will sleep to 10;30 then wake up tired and stay in bed untill 11;30  am. if I go to bed at 2 am I wake up at 6;30 am have to use the bath room then can not go back to sleep for at least a hour then do not wake up untill 11 30 am. Normally, I used to goto bed at 2 -3 am and wake up at 9 -10 am every day.  on wednesday april 7 th, the doctors office which is part of the same group as the hospital called me to go over the results from the emergency room, but the person calling did not seem to know I had called them on monday morning or they had called me back to tell me to go to the emergency room, so I do not know how much of a help the PCP will be,  but I have proof of that in the phone call records.  MY PCP is no longer with the practice, so I had to choose a new one

Became more SOB with exacerbated tachycardia and tachypnea, My family had to call 911 because I became aphasic and showing signs of possible stroke. I was taken to the ER and admitted for respiratory recovery and to role out stroke. The stroke was ruled out and I recovered with IV prednisone therapy, twice daily and supplemental oxygen. Released after HR, BP, &amp; respiratory effort returned to normal: 01/03/2021

                                                After receiving the injection I began to have a headache a short time later along with arm pain at the injection site. The next day (DEC 30th) I continued with a mild headache and the injection site pain had increased. By 1800 hrs on the 30th while at work I began not to feel well. Body aches all over along with headache. When I arrived home that night around 2300 hrs I was feeling flushed and the body aches had increased. I took my temperature several times that night with different thermometers to make sure I was getting accurate temp readings. My average temps consisted of 99.8. I did take iburofen that night. The following morning my temp was normal and the body aches had subsided. I continued to have a headache that day being DEC 31st. To note: I never had any prior symptoms, nor ever being covid positive to my knowledge. I had two prior surgeries, first procedure on NOV 4 and another procedure on DEC 9 of 2020. I was tested for Covid prior to both procedures which were negative results.

I was incredibly fatigued for about three days after. Also, the entire right forearm felt sore for about a week, as well. The day after vaccine shot, my right testes was achey and sore (and still is uncomfortable) Also, the top side of my right foot was very tender. During the course of the week, that part of my foot became lightly swollen as did the front of my right leg, up to the top of the shin bone. Today?s date: 1/22/21 5:19 pm and leg and foot still tender and slightly swollen.

                                                After patient received his vaccine, he became hot, diaphroretic, and flushed. He was wearing a long-sleeved shirt and jacket. We instructed him to take off his jacket and gave him a cool rag. After the 15 minutes of observation were up, he felt good. He denied any s/s of dizziness or light-headiness or shortness of breath. I called to check on him today and he reported that he feels a little tired and has some nausea at times. His arm is a little sore, but he is doing ok.

During his observation period he reported that he had a racing heart, shaky hands, and was sweating.  Staff monitored him and got him some water.  He stated that he had a history of hypoglycemia as well but had not had issues with it in a while.  Patient reported that his BG had been 80 that morning and that he had eaten Chick Fil a prior to coming for the vaccine.  We offered a snack or glucose tablet but patient refused.  We did recommend that the patient remain in our observation are a for an extra 15 minutes and he agreed.  After monitoring and water the patient felt better and purchased glucose tablets when he left.

                                                After the vaccination  on 1/18/2021 , I had just pain at the site of injection in my left arm for the next 2   to 3 days  and headache.  Took Advil and it went away. After 3 or 4 days i started feeling very mild pain inside my arm muscles between  the injection site and my elbow  which continued till 1/25/2021.   Later this  very mild internal pain shifted  to my elbow  and   feel a mild numbing sensation in my pinky finger.  It also feels little heavy when I move my arm.  This  continues till  today as I am reporting on 1/30/2021 3:30pm.  Since it has not bothered much , I did not seek medical care, hoping this will  go away in few weeks.

It hurt on the back right and above the right ear. It hurt to touch. My tongue is not functjioning now.  I had to get a MRI because they thought it could of been a mini stroke. MRI came back negative the doctors told me Bell Palsy.  They advise me not to get my second dose on 2/3/21.

                                                I had pain in arm from injection immediately, after injection, which was much different than first dose.  But not unexpected.  But the adverse symptoms started about 5 hours in or so, i developed a cough, and dyspnea, it was tight in my chest, hard to breathe.  the cough was/is (it remains), sometimes hard and raspy, i was a bit wheezy, and I had air hunger, like i could not breathe or get air.  if i exhale to strongly i cough, if i talk to much i cough, if i sing i cough, if i inhale too deeply i cough.  I also have been very dizzy since the shot and vertigo.  I am still coughing and it is 5 days post shot.    I started developing headache and severe body pain, pain in  my spine, low back and joints.  which is expected, but i also had scalp pain and it hurt to be even touched the slightest bit on my scalp and everywhere on my body.  I had very stiff neck and eye socket pain as well.  I also feel &#34;funny&#34; in my head.  LIke dizzy, and vertigo, but also like it is wrapped in a heavy towel and my eyes feel heavy and like i can&#39;t see well.  my vision is as if it has diminshed.    5 hours after shot cough started, and the dyspnea, i started feeling chills and deep squeezing ache in my arm at jab site, and soon had fever of 100.6, over night it went to 100.8 and i felt terrible, headache, body ache, restless.  but next day fever was 102.  it remained all day, i had zero energy slept the whole day.  no appetite, did not eat anything except a scramble egg which made me nausea.  fever remained all day at 101.8. over night.  next day temp was 99.8 (my normal is 97.6) and it was 99.8 all day.  Cough was persistent and really bad with the dyspnea this whole time and i still have cough 5 days out, just giving a timeline here.  by friday, my temp was 98 but i felt extreemly fatigued.  I went and got a covid test which was negative.  i saw the chiropractor and they helped my back and headache a little bit.  went home and rested.  cough has lingered, dizzy lingers, chest tight and sob lingers.  fatigue lingers.   Cough and dyspnea are NOT signs, the sheet i got for V-safe says right on it these are NOT expected.

It got progressively worse. By about hour 17 I was beginning to get cold sweats and stomach bothering me more. By hour 18 I was cold, sweating, nauseous, vomiting, hard tight pain in stomach /and sternum/chest.  Stomach / chest pain persisted badly for about 30- 45 minutes then began to subside.  By hour 19 most of the sever pain subsided.  for the rest of the day (@and still 25 hours later) I still have a lingering miserable stomach and slight headache.  I slept most of the afternoon without any medication.

Suffered uncharateristic insomnia the same night.  On 2/23/21, I awoke after 6 hours sleep, with mild body aches and general torpor -malaise.  This progressed into the early afternoon to severe body aches 8/10 on pain scale of 10, a moderate headache of 3/10, excessive drowsiness, extreme diaphoresis, chills, and a temperature spike of 1 degree.  I had very mild motor trembling in upper extremeties (hands) that seemed unassociated with fever.  I took no medications and slept under these general conditions for 80% of the next 48 hours.  The headache did reduce after the 10 hours from onset.

                                                after about 30 minutes, I started having a metallic taste in my mouth.  I was also experiencing soreness in left arm area.   After about an hour, the pain in my arm started to feel as though it was spreading to my left chest cavity area.  I then started to get chest pains in the left breast area to the armpit area, but not severe, just concerning.  After probably 70-80 minutes, I started feeling drowsy.  I continued to feel drowsy all evening and did not sleep well.  I woke up and could not return to sleep at 4:45am.  My normal waking time is 6:00am.  I had/have quite a bit of soreness in my arm, but nothing unbearable.  No signs of rash or inflammation around injection sight.  I am taking a sick day from work to relax and recover from loss of sleep.  The metallic taste persist, but only an annoyance and taste seems to be normal when eating or drinking.  A slight achiness in joints, but a cold front was also moving in, which can cause me to have the same effect.

                                                I experienced slight flu-like symptoms 3 days after the injection:  headache, body aches, diarrhea.  This lasted a couple of days then went away.  I woke up Tues. March 23 at 6:30 am and noticed numbness on the left side of my face and paralysis on the right side.  I&#39;d never experienced this before in my lifetime.  I contacted my physician and she advised that I go to s healthcare facility to get checked out.  Once at the healthcare facility, the attending ER doctor said everything pointed to Bell&#39;s Palsy.  However, she ordered a series of tests to rule out anything else.  All tests came back good.  Diagnosis was Bell&#39;s Palsy.  I was prescribed Prednisone, an Anti-Viral and poly eye drops.  When I awoke the next morning 3/24, the numbness on the left side had mostly gone away, but the paralysis on the right side was worse.  Today is 3/26 - there has been no change or improvement since.

As he was driving he wasn&#39;t feeling very  well,  I told him maybe we should go sit in the parking lot of the hospital.  We ended up in  parking lot.  He was pale, nauseated and  he thought he was getting a fever (but didn&#39;t)  and was really getting tired like ran down.  So,  he said for me to drive him home so he could lay down.  I got him home I called Dr.  office  I knew these symptoms were normal , but didn&#39;t think on  first dose and that fast... 30 minutes from time of injection to when he got  sick feeling.  The Doctors office just said to watch him for  symptoms if he got worse etc.,  and I asked if this was normal for how fast this happened.  She said there is no normal.   He was cold and covered up when we got home and took a 2 hour nap!  Afterwards, he helped make dinner and was ok just his arm was really sore.

                                                Received 2nd Moderna Covid shot on 03/29/2021 and on 03/31/2021, felt what I thought was a muscle cramp that never went away. Went to urgent care where the shot was given on unspecified date and they diagnosed what I thought was a muscle cramp area, as a blood clot.

As a person with diabetes, I had to take extra finger sticks that day because I did not trust my normal sensation of low blood sugar. I think this is a common reaction to the vaccine, and I intend to get the 2nd dose, but maybe diabetics should be warned about confusing this common reaction with hypoglycemia and cautioned to be extra vigilant with finger sticks the day after receiving the injection.

                                                Immediately after the vaccination, my left arm was tingling for approximately 45 minutes.  On 4/16/21, the tingling in my left arm returned. I am not sure if the tingling on 4/16 is related to the vaccination. At the time of this report, my left arm is still tingling.

Sore right arm.   4/24/21 In the morning headache and body ache.

Late afternoon headache continued but with severe body ache, chills, 100 degree fever, swollen lymph nodes in right arm pit,  red, hot and swollen rash between right shoulder and neck,  sore arm.  We called the emergency department  and they stated it could take up to 3 weeks before the painful swollen lymph nodes in the arm pit would dissipate.  They left it up to us whether to come in. We chose not to because we didn&#39;t feel there was anything more they could do for us.

                                                Had pain in my shoulder (and  neck on my left side) as soon as the shot went in. At roughly three hours after the shot, I felt I was slurring my speech (I had to make a very concerted effort to make proper sentences and not slur) and was very dizzy. I also was having a hard time with lights. For example, I was unable to look in the mirror in my bathroom as the lights above the mirror were too bright for me. At three hours after the shot, I had severe pain in my left shoulder. Overall, I felt as I had been sedated or drugged. I tried walking to the nearest convenience store to get some food and I felt I was experiencing vertigo. Several days after the vaccine I had a slight cough and sore throat. I am still experiencing a slight cough on some day sand a slight sore throat.   I had a subtle red patch in the left shoulder area a couple days after the shot. Eight or nine days after the shot, I had covid arm and had a very visible red patch on my left shoulder. I have pictures of this.  I have been feeling very tired and dizzy ever since the first shot. My glands in my neck under my jaw line are also swollen. I do not know if it is either  wise or safe for me to get the second shot, which is scheduled for this Friday as it seems that I still have not recovered from the first shot. Can my immune system really take another round of this?  There are a couple other things that I have noticed. I don&#39;t seem to be thinking very clearly and I have noticed a remarkable number of type-os and poor syntax in emails that I send at work; this is not normal for me.   Finally, after the shot, I noticed that my muscles, when doing a little exertion such as pushups, would build lactic acid quicker and more blood seemed to be delivered to my working muscles. I still have not regained my strength and tire more easierly when playing tennis or hitting against the tennis wall, for example. This is also not normal and not how I felt before the first injection.

Leg pain continued to get worse until Friday and he couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Patient went to ER on Sunday morning because the pain was so severe he couldn&#39;t walk. The pain was in his knees, lower legs, ankles, and feet.  The ER doctor sent him to hospital to be admitted.  The patient was in hospital for 6 days.  The patient was given pain meds and a rheumatologist was called in and she diagnosed him with gout.  they treated him with 4 doses of Anakinra.  That medication helped.  The patient currently is in pain if he is walking around pain level between a 5-8.  The pain is less if he remains seated.  He experiences the most discomfort when standing from a seated position mostly in his knees.

                                                Note: May 24, 2021 the pharmacy that administered the COVID vaccines contacted me with some billing questions. When I mentioned my severe reactions, they told me they were filing a report upon my behalf. When done they told me it was the VAERS system and gave me a reference number (Ref-531994). I decided that not enough information would be in that report so wanted to submit myself because of my severe reaction and hospitalization. My PCP was not involved until after hospital for a follow up and I was seen by numerous doctors there, so I have no easy single POC until I dig more.

Apr 17, 2021 Wake to find tongue hugely swelled. Thought I&#39;d bitten in my sleep. Unable to eat, hard to swallow fluid past tongue. Lasts for a bit over 36 hrs. Apr 19, 2021 Knee pain begins spreading up thighs down calves. Pain also beginning in feet toes and ankles. Apr 20, 2021 Knee pain when bending prevents me from entering truck to drive.

Apr 28, 2021 Approx. 2:30 pm knee/overall leg pain begins increasing rapidly to higher than before level. Over next three days increases to point where I cannot stand/walk due to pain. Unable to sleep due to pain also. Apr 28, 2021 Same Day-Around 4:30 pm notice voice is becoming raspy. By 6 pm my voice is completely gone. I have no voice for next approx. 36 hrs.

Less each day but still need for stability. Still have knee pain. Have higher level of pain in feet.  I had/have a major reaction to the Moderna vaccine. This should be investigated and reported on.

                                                Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in right lower leg.  Symptoms initially occurred about two days after feeling sick with a high fever.  Initially, the pain in the right calf muscle was thought to be a muscle or tendon strain.  On May 22nd, during a campout, there was pain along the entire right leg, but at the time I thought it was just related to lower back pain from sleeping on the ground.  On May 27 and 28th there was sharp pain at the bottom of my right foot, then on May 29th I noticed sweeling and a hard warm spot just above the inside right ankle.  I reported to a local urgent care clinic first  then was referred to Medical ER.

                                                Shortly after the 2nd shot of Moderna my tongue/taste buds felt ?prickly? and I had a metallic taste in my mouth. The metallic taste went away by the evening but not the tongue sensation. By the evening of the first day I had patches of irritation develop along the edges of my tongue. I didn?t really pay too much attention to it until I ate some hot sauce the next day! I took pictures 2 days after the shot. My symptoms are closest to what has been described as ?Covid tongue?. My tongue symptoms have varied  day to day but haven?t  cleared yet (a month later).

                                                Patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical history who presents with complaint of sudden onset of left-sided nonradiating chest discomfort of sudden onset approximately 1 hour prior to presentation while doing administrative work at rest.    He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient&#39;s Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient&#39;s tachycardia patient&#39;s Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily. (Please note clarification in comparison to discharge home med list.  Toprol XL 25 mg daily was called to pharmacy in place of the metoprolol.)

Noticed that when my arm is to the side of my body, it started going numb- right arm. I also had to get up around 4 times to urinate a lot. I was getting night sweats. When I would get up, I had a slight head ache and dizziness. I still have it right now, the headache and dizziness. Even when I walk, I have to extend my pinky finger out so my arm will not go numb. As we are speaking right now, my pinky finger is going numb. Once I extend it out, it goes away, but when I put it down by my side, it goes numb. My whole body is sore as well.

At 16 days post injections, frontal and temporal headache began, lasting approx 12 hrs and then waves of severe body aches began (random location - back, neck, right lateral midfoot, knees, right radiocarpal joint), along with mild chills and mild fever (never &gt;100.0).  These symptoms would recur approx every 8 hrs for the next 4 days.  Days 3-4 of the symptoms were debilitating and I primarily remained in bed.  Today is the first day or somewhat normal.  Still feel some ache and mild fatigue.  Never lost taste or smell and never had any respiratory issues or GI issues.

The patient&#39;s medical history included daily exercise and no personal or family history of clotting issues and no trauma. Products known to have been used by the patient were not provided.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039k20-2a) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 30 Jan 2021, approximately 28 days after the first dose, and prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012m20a) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Jan 2021, the patient reports that for the first 18 hours, he experienced fever, chills and myalgia.   On 01 Feb 2021, the patient reports that he thought the myalgia was continuing, as he had pain in his chest and back. The chest pains gradually worsened.  On 05 Feb 20221, the patient went to the emergency room and was admitted.  He was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. He was started on enoxaparin sodium but switched to apixaban. A computerized tomography study of the lungs showed that he had bilateral pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct and atelectasis. His dimer was 4800. COVID-19 test was negative.  An echocardiograph was performed, no results were reported. An ultrasound of the legs was performed and ruled out deep vein thrombosis. Date of discharge was not specified.  On an unknown date two days after discharge, the patient experienced left leg pain and returned to the emergency department. Patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis that ran the entire length of the femoral artery. Patient was switched back to enoxaparin sodium and taken off the apixaban. A repeat computerized tomography study was done to see if the pulmonary embolism was progressing and it was not, however, it showed pulmonary effusions. All current lab work was reported as normal, except for an increased prothrombin time. COVID-19 test was negative.  Patient continues to be followed by a pulmonologist and hematologist.  Consent to contact patient, pulmonologist and hematologist was obtained.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, fever/pyrexia, chills, myalgia, chest and back pains, bilateral pulmonary embolism/pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct/pulmonary infarct, ateltheisis/atelectasis, left leg pain, and deep vein thrombosis, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this events has been provided at this time.

Unlike during the disease, my hips strongly ached 24 hours after recieving the injection.  COVID cough returned though not as bad as when I had the disease, as well as fealing weak and out of breath.  All of this lasted for about 36 hours.  Feeling a bit better now, but still winded and weak.   Still plan to get 2nd shot.

I got home and about 5:30 pm I was resting against my boat cause I was feeling nausea and a headache.  Also it felt like my food tasted different...I had ate some chips the day after the shot on March 17th and I had told my wife that they tasted different.  Anyway, on  March 20th around 8:30 pm I went to spit and realized I could only spit from the right side of my mouth. I called my daughter, who is an ICU RN, asked me to do a series of tests over facetime with her and she told me I should go in cause when I smiled it wasn&#39;t symmetrical.  She came and picked me up and took me to hospital in.  Immediately there they asked me to smile and to raise my eyebrows and they treated for &#34;possible&#34; stroke.

                                                Muscle pain and serious fatigue. It is continuous. Every day, muscle pain in legs makes me feel like I ran a marathon, hard to climb stairs to go upstairs in my home. It is preventing me from doing any physical work or activities. Sometimes I feel like, i.e. some days and times, as if I cannot move or I am almost fainting.

                                                Very sore arm (much worse than the first shot a month earlier). I woke up on March 27 (day after being vaccinated for my second shot) feeling like I was coming down with the flu, with aches and pains, and fatigue. No fever. I took ibuprofen and felt better but I had a general &#34;under the weather&#34; feeling until the following day. But for five days afterwards, I had to take a nap in the late afternoon and felt generally more tired. Also, my elbow has been hurting in my vaccinated arm for the past week (I never have issues with that elbow, though it could be coincidence and unrelated to the vaccine).

The arm muscle also was sore again. Did not take any medications for this and then the spot went away after 2 days.

                                                About 30 seconds after receiving my injection I started to feel dizzy, nauseous, blurry vision and a few minutes later my lips and fingertips became tingly and numb.  My cousin let an attendant know and they sent a Paramedic over to our vehicle.  The Paramedic took my vitals (which I believe were all normal) and gave me a bag in case I needed to vomit.  I started to feel a little better about 20 minutes after the injection and chose to go home and rest rather than go to the hospital.  The 2nd day my arm hurt where to injection was given, I had a headache and was still a bit nauseous although I never did vomit.  I still did not feel 100% on the 3rd and 4th day and better on the 5th day.

They were warm to the touch on the outside but I felt like they were very cold.  I put on wool socks, added a blanket and took 2 Advil and after a while the cold feeling diminished (but didn&#39;t go away).  Eventually the following morning I didn&#39;t have the cold feeling anymore.  I also had the typical post vaccine low grade fever and fatigue.  All of these symptoms were gone within 36 hours of getting the vaccine.  I have talked to others who had the same &#34;cold toes&#34; symptom as me, one of them still has it sometimes.

Patient reports he takes supplements as concomitant medications Patient was prescribed clonazepam for his anxiety and took ibuprofen for his symptoms. Patient went to the ER two weeks after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, he was checked out, ran some tests and everything was within normal limits. Blood work was normal.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.

This continued at that intensity for about a week.  I couldn&#39;t do ANYTHING...was previously running 7 miles/day but in the past month since vaccine I have only had the energy to walk around the block one time.  The cognitive impairment has been debilitating at work where I can not concentrate or process complex topics.  I&#39;m an IT executive so this is part of my daily job and was no problem prior to the vaccine.  By the second week I was starting to make very tiny progress each day.  I would be OK for an hour or 2 after waking up but then the fatigue and malaise would return and I wouldn&#39;t be able to work.  This is often accompanied by headache.  Generally the duration of symptoms has been  getting shorter each day but very slowly. On may 9 my impairment was so great I couldn&#39;t even drive (was like being a bit drunk).  Finally, Monday May 10, the intensity of the symptoms was light enough that I was able to work a full day despite the mild headache and fog.  The same continued on May 11, so I hope I am close to being over this.

I then gave the patient 50mg of oral diphenhydramine and he took that along with 16 oz of water. He also stated that he &#34;felt like&#34; his blood pressure was elevated, but that he was anxious about getting a shot so it was probably that. 25 minutes after the diphenhydramine was administered the patient stated that the metallic taste was gone, his mouth wasn&#39;t dry, and his BP was normal. I observed the patient for a total of 60 minutes and he felt normal and wanted to go home.

                                                High fever (103.3) on 2/21/2021 that lasted for 6 hours and stopped with ibuprofen.  Left arm soreness persisted for 3 days and stiffness in the left shoulder became more prevalent.  During the last 3 months, range of motion in the left shoulder has decreased, general weakness in the left arm noted and now there is severe pain in the left shoulder when moved in certain positions.  Large decrease in range of motion.  Can no longer reach across my chest with severe pinching on the top of the left shoulder joint.  Can no longer swing a golf club without severe pain and swing limitations due to range of motion decrease.  I saw my primary care physician last week and he has referred me to an orthopedic doctor.  My appointment is for Monday, June 7th in Stephenville, Texas.

Admitted to hospital, was on prednisone and benzos, for a few days. Was in contact with neuro and endocrinologist.  I was very angry with this happened I tried calling Mederna, Mederna read him the info about not being able to sue them. He waited three months before Mederna asked for records, CDC did nothing. Very angry about the fact that nothing was set up to help people with severe reactions to the vaccines. No one wanted to listen to him. Endocrinologist said this is not normal and they continued to push forward and it was proven that it was attributed to the vaccine.  Nerve damage underneath the right eye from the Bells Palsy.

By 3am, my stomach/chest did not feel good at all and I had trouble sleeping. It was definitely not heart related. By 8am I felt chills coming on. By 9am I was fully dressed, with two blankets on, and lying on couch shaking for 20-30 minutes. Later a fever started and it reached about 102.3 before subsiding late afternoon. By 8pm, I felt blah but fever was gone. During that entire time I felt achy overall (similar to what I felt like 2 hours after running a marathon).  I didn&#39;t have headaches (and rarely do), but area around my eyes were heavy and tired. Weirdly, at times, the top 1/2 of both ears hurt.   I experience about every symptom I had as when I had Covid and went to hospital for 26 days except for the breathing issues.

                                                About 9 days after first dose I started to notice hives and redness on both side of my stomach, on both front lower legs and arms. Went to primary care Dr and he said he didn?t know we?re it came from but to take allergy med. which I have been doing and it started to clear up some but then I got my second dose and it really came on after that. It is not really a itch rash but taking a shower seems to make it worse and itchy. It has not gotten any better and seems to burn a little bit at times. I plan on giving it another week are so and if not better will be going to dermatologist. As far as I can remember I have never had a rash besides poison oak. I do not nor can I find any information online about a rash starting several days after vaccine unlike the allergic reaction some people are having soon after receiving vaccine. So it does have me a little worried mainly because I do not know what it is but I?m pretty sure it is from the vaccine considering the fact it started 9 days after first dose and never really went away and the second dose seems to have aggravated it to we?re it is worse.

Talked to the nurse and she said that this can be a common side effect as the powder mixed with the liquid is cold.  If i have more troubles let her know.    After my 35 minutes I left wondering if my lips feeling funny.  i drove 12 miles to my school and went straight to the nurse as my lips were swelling up.  My throat and tongue ok.  I took Benadryl and then hubby picked me up and we went straight to ER.  On the way to hospital my tongue started to feel thick on the left side as we were only blocks away.   Immediately they took great care of me!  They gave my Epi pen shot, steriod and more Benadryl.   I left 3 hours later.  Came home and taking Benadryl as still slight numbness on left lip.   Throat and Tongue great.

Pt&#39;s B/P was more elevated that normal, &#34;160 systolic over  100 something.&#34;    Pt stated he took  2 extra amlodipine and worked the remained of the day.  That night he began to feel hot,  muscle aches, no appetite, and no energy.  The next day felt the same symptoms and stayed in his chair all day.  On 3/3/2021 he was able to go to work but still had no energy.

Abdominal pain came that seemed to be coming from the region of my liver and I had been having some problem with that previously (in a mild way) and the injection seemed to make this flare up more. About 4 days after injection, I went to ER and they did blood test and liver tests. And over time it seemed to resolved itself in a few days. The pain in my SI joint flared up about 24 hours after the injection - the extreme pain lasted for about 24 hours and then it slowly tapered off after a couple of days.

                                                My arm was sore. Then I had fatigue and then at about 14 hours after the injection, I started having chills - like I had temperature with hot and cold chills. I got very cold; my blood pressure dropped - I happened to have a doctor appt the day following the vaccine - the bottom level was very low of my blood pressure - it was 45. I couldn&#39;t warm up - my extremities were very cold. I had chest pain and it felt like my heart rate was going in an out of atrial fibulation. I had shortness of breath. I measured my blood oxygen concentration and had dropped down to 90%. I didn&#39;t sleep well because I was so chilled and not feeling well. I felt like I had a bad flu. I rested the next day (10th) the symptoms slowly went away between 10 am and 1:00. At 3:00 pm, I saw my pain doctor and I told him about it but I was feeling much better although blood pressure was low. Fatigue lasted for 3-5 days afterwards but it wasn&#39;t anything last the first 24 hours. I didn&#39;t go to ER because it seemed to resolve itself in the day.

The arm is swollen, warm to the touch, and black and blue. Today I have a mild fever, some hot flashes, nausea without vomiting, body weakness, and overall muscle aching. This is the sickest I&#39;ve been in years.

I had fever, chills, rapid pulse (108 bpm normally runs 70), &amp; chest tightness. Almost called ambulance because of the pulse and chest tightness. Within a couple hours of waking up I also began to have muscle cramps in my feet, toes, and thighs. Worse than I have ever experienced  and I have been diagnosed with PAD for over 10 years. I tried to get some sleep. I couldn&#39;t. My PCP also did not like the way my lungs sounded that morning at the Clinic. I was told after a xray that my lungs were ok. My injection site has been sore until today. It is better. I did have Covid in October 2020.

                                                about 12 hours after receiving injection began getting aches in arm, head and body. Aches became very strong overnight. Headache was very strong and the type that caused ringing in ears. Overnight got strong chills and fever. These side effects lasted approximately 12 hours. Knowing they were side effects from the vaccine kept me from going to the doctor. These side effects were eerily similar to symptoms I had when I was ill out of the country in Spring 2019. The strong aches, chills and fever were identical. With the very low COVID cases in that country currently, it makes me think that I potentially had a similar coronavirus in 2019, and potentially that is why cases are low in those countries now since the virus may have already done its damage in those countries.

At 20 minutes the symptoms seemed to plateau  and I drove home and the symptoms mostly subsided, but whole armed seemed cold and tingly.

I experienced joint pain and muscle pain throughout the body.  I experienced a headache for most of the period.  I took Tylenol (acetaminophen) that provided relief for the headache and muscle and joint pain.  Besides that I basically slept for the period from 11pm day of vaccination through 4:30pm day after vaccination.

In morning I was overcome with sweats, and was ?sick? with all these symptoms most the rest of the day ? despite taking it easy and taking Tylenol   After an early dinner Friday evening, I went to bed for the next 12 hours,  Though I woke up a few times all sweaty during that stretch, by morning I was feeling pretty normal.  So, I figure my body was under duress for  30-33 hours.  Although I didn?t feel real bad for some 12 hours after injection, I did encounter some indigestion starting a few hours after the shot.

                                                Looking back, I had a slow, intermittent pain in my right shoulder/arm region. It was nonspecific but mostly related when raising my arm while getting dressed/putting my shirt on. It became more frequent over the next month. This past week it seemed to be more classic like a &#34;tendonitis&#34; towards the mid-distal deltoid region.

He was tested for COVID-19 at the hospital and the result came back positive. Patient was not able to eat or drink, diarrhea, have muscle aches and weaknesses, and fever. Caller also stated patient is having coughs (she stated this could be due to him being a smoker). Patient is still experiencing these symptoms at time of call. Patient temp was taken at 5pm with a reading of 101 degree. When patient was in the hospital on 4/1/2021 he was given IV fluid. Since he was released from the hospital he has only been taking Tylenol to reduce his fever. Patient prescribed cough medication by ER doctor but he has not yet taken it since released from the hospital. Due to his positive COVID-19 test result, he was instructed to quarantine for 2 weeks by ER doctor.

When called by this nurse, he had mild symptoms of sore arm and body aches that were managed by ibuprofen.  He understands that he will need one more dose in about a month.  He will call public health or tell the nurse if his symptoms worsen.

From my research, this did not seem like a typical side effect.    I had trouble sleeping, eating and swallowing without pain.  This is now 8 days after my shot and I still have pain.  I have taken motrin and this has helped, but only some.  As of today, my pain is not as bad as it had developed over the past week.  I reported this to my healthcare provider via a call first and all their only recommendation was to take motrin and not come in for a visit / investigation for 2 weeks which I did not agree with at all based on the severity.  These symptoms that I am reporting do not seem common and based on the severity I really question if i plan to take the second dose.  I really felt that this needed to be reported

In the middle of the night on 4/27 I woke up due to severe pain in my right ankle, right knee and right hip.  It was a full blown Rheumatoid Arthritis flair up.  I couldn&#39;t walk, required crutches to move from room to room.  Right knee was swollen.  Right foot became numb which has not happened to me with previous flair ups.  Blood pressure was taken and running high.  Called on line doctor and she recommended going to ER.  I sent my Rheumotolgist doctor an email.  I have yet to hear back.  Symptoms began subsiding around 3pm on 4/27.  I am able to walk now without crutches.  Swelling has subsided in right knee.  Right foot is still

After the third day and onward, pressure onsets when I stand or while walking.  Pressure increases until dizzyness sets in, hearing diminishes, followed by pain in front of head. 2.  Pain and pressure in neck and down spine. 3.  Occasional sharp pain in head, as if a blood vessel is about to pop. 4.  After two 1/2 weeks, developed constant sensation of having a migraine headache. Visited doctor April 15th.   Prescribed Methylprednisolone, 4 mg.  Pain and pressure down spine reduced, but did not help other symptoms.   Visited doctor again April 27th.  Doctor gave me medication for Migraine headaches.  It is not helping so far. Doctor ordered MRI scan.   Appointment will be April 30, 2021

Patient answered No to all of the vaccination screening questions on MyTurn. At 1000, patient was checked in by staff. Immunization was administered approximately at 1002. Around 1007, the clinic providers were called for emergency response by CORE team member who was stationed at the observation area because this patient lost consciousness, fell down, and hit his head.  NP arrived to the scene with Emergency Epinephrine pen and benadryl tablets. RN was already at scene and assessed for patient&#39;s consciousness. EMS was called by Google volunteer. Patient was seated in the chair, being monitored by the clinic and CORE team member. Pt was unresponsive and actively undergoing tonic seizure-like activity with sustained posturing of bilateral hands in decorticate &#34;cup&#34; position. Patient&#39;s eyes were open during entire seizure-like activity, but unresponsive to stimuli. Inflamed abrasions were noted on patient&#39;s right temporal lobe, right cheek, and bilateral lower extremities near the knees. No active bleeding was seen.  At 1008, Pt regained consciousness after 10 seconds of seizure activity and began to answer RN&#39;s questions.

The patient was treated with valaciclovir hydrochloride (Valtrex). On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg were unknown and the outcome of the shingles was not recovered/not resolved and the outcome of the generalized raised red spots limbs and red spotty rash were recovering/resolving.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg to be related to Shingrix and Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: The patient self reported the case. On an unknown date, less than 3 months after the 1st dose and less than 2 months after the 2nd dose the patient experienced shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg. The patient had not felt good for a few weeks and then in the last week before the reporting date he started to get symptoms.  The patient felt crappy and had shooting pain in his back on the left side and the pain shot down his leg and then he had a rash on his left leg later. His torso, back, butt, and upper thighs were stingy, burning, and he was sensitive to the touch on his skin before the rash appeared. He described it as aches and pains and a stingy, needle feeling.  The patient had a history of ulcerative colitis and he took Azathioprine during the past few years so he was unsure if his rash was related to his weak immune system or the COVID vaccine.  The patient had sent pictures of his left leg rash to his physician and they recommended him to see a dermatologist who diagnosed him with shingles after a biopsy and tests. They immediately put him on Valtrex and he claimed that things started to calm down and the rash was started to dry up.  The patient described the rash as starting off as red spots that were raised up that looked like a target with a red circle around it that would get bigger. The raised spot looked like there was fluid inside. The dot in the middle looked dark in color and the red part that had spread looked like a bruise that was resolving with the color of yellow and brown.  The patient had a few clusters of the rash on the inside and outside of his left leg and back on his calf.  It was unknown if the reporter considered the shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg to be related to COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA and COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. The reporter consented to follow up.

He states that within a week he started having pain in his left foot that eventually moved up to just below his knee.  This included swelling.  He saw his physician, who began treating him for gout.  His also said that he felt off and insisted that his doctor checks his blood sugar, although he had no previous issues with his blood sugars.  He came back at a 241.  He is now taking allopurinol and metformin.  The pain and swelling in his left leg is subsiding now.  He did go thru one period of 4 days where he said he could not stand on his left leg.  He was due for his second shot today, 5/24/21, but chose not to out of caution, until his doctor figures out what is going on.  Also, his dietician recommended he not get the vaccine at this time

                                                A friend texted me today at 1231 on 1-11-21 asking me how I was doing following the COVID vaccination given 10 Jan 21 which we both received.  In subsequent texts he disclosed that he was had difficulty sleeping last night due to fever and 7/10 chest pain. He took motrin 800mg and ½ of a Percocet, but did not relieve chest pain. He denied any SOB and he described his pulse as wnl. He also noted dizziness, sweating and left arm pain. He denied hx of HTN, but did relate a history of dyslipidemia which he felt was controlled. I then contacted him by phone and he verified his text messages. As he is over 50 yo and has symptoms suggestive of an Acute Coronary Syndrome he was advised to take aspirin and call 911...He was seen at Hospital, ER  on 1-11-21. A mediastinal mass was noted on imaging. This mass was initially thought to be the cause of his chest pain and not related to his Covid vaccination. He was later seen by a thoracic surgeon with follow-up imaging showing significant decrease in the size of the mass raising the possibility in may be inflammatory or infectious in nature. He continues to be followed and has not had any surgeries for this condition.  His thoracic surgeon is:   MD thoracic surgery Specialized cancer program   Hospital  Name of a cancer institute Listed Address Listed phone number and fax number

                                                Patient received first dose Moderna vaccine on  3/31/2021. Approximately two weeks after receiving the first Moderna vaccine patient states he started to have pain in the lower leg which was not normal. Pain increased to a point that patient seeked care and was evaluated for a blood clot which he was told was &#34;negative&#34; as no clot was initially found. On 4/28/2021 Patient presented to pharmacy to receive second dose. Pharmacist asked how patient tolerated first dose to which he replied he had no issues, so the second dose was administered. AFTER the second dose, patient did state he was seen by a CNP for leg pain but a clot was ruled out. Approximately 3 weeks after the second dose of Moderna vaccine the patients leg pain increased to a point that he presented to the local ER and it was determined at that visit that he did indeed have a large blood clot in the leg and a second smaller clot in the upper thigh. He was sent home on Eliquis. He subsequently presented to another ER approximately one week later for uncontrolled leg pain due to massive size of blood clot in leg. At this point, patient is at home recovering.

                                                Patient said while receiving his shot that after his first dose, when he was waiting in waiting area he became very hot and had to rest on the floor.  In an attempt to avoid this feeling, I gave the patient a bottle of water and a can of ginger ale, which was cold.  At first he said that the cold ginger ale felt very good, but several minutes after the shot he said he was beginning to feel &#34;heat&#34; rise from his shoulders through his neck.  He asked if he could recline on the floor as he wanted to feel the cold on his back.  I stayed with the patient and talked to him while he was resting.  He stayed there for about 5 minutes and then said he was feeling better.

By 9 30pm I was nauseous and full blow stomach pain.  My stomach was &#39;roiling or churning.&#39;   Then between 9 30pm and 2 30am the next day I was nauseous, had stomach pain, I felt hot and cold and my head became more congested and I got a headache.  Note: the head congestion was there prior to getting the vaccine, but it got worse.   I sipped water throughout and it felt like I had to vomit (but I did not vomit).   I took my temperature a few times it ranged from 98 to 98.8.   My normal temperature is 97 to 97.5.   By morning, or about 4am the worse symptoms were gone.  My stomach felt more or less ok and at 7am  I ate a light breakfast without incident.   My temperature seemed to be elevated through the day.  I felt somewhat weak during the day.  Worst effects seem gone by Jan 8 evening.   The only effect left is pain in my left upper arm.  I consider these to be significant and worrying side effects and I may not take the second dose.

                                                Significant flu like symptoms that lasted for 36 hours from onset.  Included a fever of over 101, sweats, chills and uncontrollable shivering.  Had some numbness in fingers and toes.  These symptoms were actually more severe that when I had Covid 19. Taking Tylenol would help ease the symptoms, I did rotate in a dose of Ibuprofen on a 2 hour interval one time during the worst of the symptoms. After the 36 hour mark the symptoms faded and I returned to a normal state, although very drained and fatigued. The severity of the symptoms seem like they would be dangerous for someone who is not in good health.

                                                12 hours after began to have a scratch throat.  at 13 hours post dose, had a headache start and an unusual erythematous spot on the posterior palate above Uvula with almost a white scratch appearance inside the erythema.  16 hours post dose began to have fevers and chills.  At 17 hours had severe sweats that soaked the bed with rigorous chills including teeth chattering shaking chills.  Took 800mg ibuprofen and went back to sleep.  Poor sleep with many awakenings.  Woke 22 hours post dose with no fevers or chills any longer but had headache that is different than my usual migraines or tension headaches.  Took 2 Fioricet with minimal change in headache.  Felt off for most of the day, and felt warm and achy.  Next night of sleep was again restless with some sweating beyond usual and awakened with swelling feeling in throat during the night.  Woke 46 hours post dose with headache again, as well as substantial uvula and soft palate edema with mild erythematous appearance.  The swelling gave me a fullness felling that made it hard to swallow and felt like my voice was changed.  I have had this same uvula edema in the past with rare allergic reactions to food, and flower that I once smelled.  The Uvula looks like a water filled ballon.  NO nodes in the neck.  The injection site has had mild induration, and swelling and has been itchy.  Headaches have persisted to a moderate extent.  Uvula Swelling has persisted to the point that I took a dose of prednisone 52 hours post vaccine.    It is now 54 hours post dose and I just feel a bit off, swollen uvula, headache and itchy vaccine site.

On 15 Jan, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I began to get back and leg aches from my sciatica, but on my left side.  I immediately began my routine (exercise) and back brace which usually stop the pain. Over the next two day, the symptoms got worse to the point of extreme pain in my back and all down my left leg.  This resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 17 January.  I have since had an appointment with my pain specialist, and an MRI.  We are awaiting results from the MRI.  The pain has not lessened, and pain medication are only mildly effective. The pain being in my left side make since as the Rhyzotomy had been done on my right side.  I am concerned the vaccine may have cause tissue or nerve swelling. Pain is still intense to the point of immobility and difficulty sleeping.

                                                Patient came to the emergency department on 02/02/2020 at 2:30 pm to be evaluated for possible stroke due to sudden acute numbness, weakness in right wrist and arm, but no pain. Patient has no prior history of sudden acute numbness in arm and did not report any recent injury to his arm. Neurologist evaluated patient for possible stroke and patient was unable to lift right wrist and hand. Patient was able to lift both arms overhead, lift both legs, smile normal, open and close mouth and move tongue.  Both CT Scan and MRI were normal. Neurologist and emergency medical specialist determined that patient did not have a stroke and diagnosed acute brachial plexus palsy possibly due to patient sleeping in an awkward position. Emergency specialist said it was unlikely but could not rule out the possibility of an adverse reaction to the Moderna vaccine, which patient had received 10 days earlier (second dose, see details above.)

It would get bigger and smaller.  It would be very red and then less red.  It just came and went.  After about a week or so, it went away.

Feeling like extreme leg cramps when standing or walking. I did seek medical attention with my orthopedic doctor and had hip xrays on my left hip. She saw mild to moderate arthritis in my hip joint. I was prescribed an anti inflammatory as well as taking tylenol to supplement.  The symptoms have not subsided and I plan on following up with my medical doctor. I have had bad spasms in my hip and thigh area and swelling from the top of my thigh to my knee.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 09 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine the patient had sore arm. On an unspecified date in Jan 2021, the patient had experienced a pull in his muscle in his calf and lower calf area got swollen. On 09 Feb 2021, after receiving the second dose of vaccine he had experienced a sore arm. On 11 Mar 2021, his leg got really swollen and on 12 Mar 2021, he visited hospital where it got diagnosed as DVT in his right lower calf. Treatment for the events included blood thinner Apixaban. Patient is concerned about possibility of indirect relation of events to the vaccine.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the event DVT, leg got really swollen, swelling of the lower calf area and calf pain were unknown at the time of this report. The event pulled a muscle is not resolved. The event sore arm which the patient experienced for both the doses got resolved on 13 Jan and 14 Jan 2021, respectively.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association a causal association between the event of sore arm and the administration of mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded.  The evens of DVT , pulled muscle and swelling of lower calf is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Events were all attributed to muscle strain.

                                                Symptoms are not unusual, but THE DURATION IS VERY UNUSUAL. Starting from 4-6 hours after the vaccine and still persist THREE WEEKS later!  Lightheadedness/dizziness, mild nausea, some intermittent jitteriness , periodic extreme fatigue. This has been going on every day for THREE WEEKS. Symptoms have faded some, but still persist. Will delay or cancel second shot.  If these effects are permanent, then I will have great difficulty doing my job.

The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation and had a pacemaker placed about 8-9 months ago.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event were blood pressure medication, antiarrhythmics.  On 01 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030m20a) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 01 Mar 2021, after vaccination, the patient developed red dots on both of his arms. For next two days, the patient had rash on both arms, was dizzy, felt sick, developed fast heart rate; went to hospital twice for heart rate either 07 Mar 2021 or 13 Mar 2021.During first visit to hospital, fast rate was brought under control, while in the second visit, the patient had a procedure in which his heart was cut from top to bottom and was made pacemaker dependent. The atrial fibrillation could not be controlled for 26 hours and had a flutter which was not identified and could not be controlled. Flutter returned after stopping amlodipine and hence patient was restarted on amlodipine. The patient now feels very weak, has a hard time walking, has no energy, cannot do the simplest of tasks, still experiences fast heart rate and flutter every now and then.   No Laboratory investigations were provided. The Treatment information included pacemaker, amlodipine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cardiac pacemaker dependent, atrial fibrillation, red dots on both of his arms, rash on both arms, dizziness, sick, atrial flutter, very weak and no energy, hard time walking, cannot do the simplest of tasks were unknown.

Blood pressure 160/82, pulse 70 bpm.  Pt became sweaty and laid down, continued with &#34;wave of dizziness,&#34; so decided to alternate between standing and sitting. At 1500, symptoms continued. blood pressure 180/100 pulse 70 bpm, drinking water c/o some shakiness. 1510 blood pressure 164/84 still c/o waves of dizziness, clammy. No respiratory distress. 1520 blood pressure 180/100 pulse 85 bpm 97% O2. No longer feels clammy, states that he &#34;feels normal other than lightheaded and dizzy.

No itching sensation.  1530 blood pressure 182/102, pulse 85 bpm, 97% O2. &#34;I feel dizzy when you take my blood pressure.&#34; When asked about his breathing pt states &#34;breathing feels fine.&#34; 1540 no itching.

Erythema appears better, not as spread out across chest, more condensed. &#34;Dizziness still comes in waves.&#34; 1607 blood pressure 204/102, pulse 90bpm, 97% O2- clammy to touch. After discussing with patient and patients spouse, agree that patient needs to be seen by either PCP, Dr. or go to ER. At the time pt did not wish to go to ER. Wife proceeded to call Dr.&#39;s office to see about getting him in. Pt then started to feel worse and like he needed to go to ER. offered to call for an ambulance, pt refused as his wife could take him and would probably be quicker. staff offered diphenhydramine and pt declined, stating he would wait until he got to ER for treatment. Pt appeared very anxious and nervous. transported him via wheelchair to his vehicle at 1620, his wife then drove him to ER. 04/09/2021 at 0828  I left a voicemail with pt for follow up.  0830 I called to get follow up on pt. I spoke with the nurse that treated the patient. Pt did indeed come to ER and was treated for a reaction. He was given a dose of benadryl and solumedrol. Pt verbalized feeling like he was having a severe anxiety attack and that his adrenaline was really high. Nurse stated that she agreed with him. Pt was later discharged that evening. No epinephrine use reported.

                                                Began feeling very ill one day after vaccine.  Had severe headache, body aches, fatigue.  Soon after I developed weakness and numbness in lower legs and feet.  This has continued and not let up.  I have had dizziness, difficulty sitting or standing up for long periods of time.  Had severe pain in legs.  Had to lie in bed most of the time.  Anxiety, shakiness, difficulty sleeping also progressed.  Had extreme fatigue and continued feelings of being ill and light headed.  The numbness and pins and needles in feet continue.  Cannot walk for long periods, very limited in my ability to do anything physical.

                                                On Monday night I tossed and turned, and I gradually realized I felt quite ill. By Tuesday morning I had what I understand to be typical reactions to the second dose: soreness at the injection site, fatigue, muscle aches, chills, overheating, loss of taste, and a touch of nausea. My head was swimming, and putting my hands to my forehead made my head feel a bit better. By midday Wednesday I was gradually improving. But Wednesday evening, at my desk, I noticed my vision seemed blurry. On Thursday morning, I verified that my reading vision (with glasses) was (and is) markedly worse. Now I cannot easily read from my smart phone or computer screen. I plan to see an optometrist as soon as possible.

                                                Severe tinnitus beginning 18 hours after the 2nd vaccine. The tinnitus has not subsided very much as of the date of this report. About 18 hours after the second shot I started getting a very severe headache. The absolute worst of my life and debilitating. I did not have a high fever, but had some chills and fatigue. No nausea. I expected the ringing to return to my &#34;normal&#34; levels pre-vaccine, which is a level that is not usually noticeable unless I focus on it. Now my ears are ringing loudly and the sound is ever present. I am worried this will be a chronic condition.

By the time  I had arrived at the house my head was pounding.   I was feeling  a dizzying  migraine.  I have not had one of those in a  while.  It was also accompanied with lite nausea.  I had a cup of coffee when I came home and went to bed.  I was feeling so bad I had to get up  and take a Sumatriptan and another cup of coffee.  I laid back down for a few more hours.  I awakened later,  used the restroom  and was feeling much better than before.   Although my arm and shoulder is sore at the injection site,  I?m feeling much better.

She took his blood oxygen because he is on oxygen for COPD and it was lower than normal. She turned his oxygen up to 5%, then took his blood pressure. His blood pressure was 256/136, so she called the ambulance. When he was brought into the hospital they put him on a ventilator.  He is still on a ventilator as of 5/8/2021. The hospital staff said he had double pneumonia and they plan on trying to take him off the ventilator on 5/10/2021.

A few weeks later May 9,2021; I noticed discomfort and swelling in the same lower left leg and my, medical alert service dog, kept alerting to it.  I had a regular appointment with my cardioligist on May 10,2021 and advised of my issue and he ordered an ultrasound. The ultra sound revealed blood clots on my llower left leg.  I have never had clotting issues in my life and absolutely believe that this colt was caused by the Moderna vaccine, since i have been on anticoagulants and asprin theray since 2008.

He noticed an increase in stooling after eating, however stools were solid. The muscle cramps and mood changes mostly subsided after 7 days, however on day 8 (5/27/21) he was still experiencing taste changes, gi upset, and was having difficulty sleeping. I guided the patient on some symptom relieve and instructed him to contact the pharmacy or his doctor if the symptoms worsened or did not resolve within another 7 days. He felt he was on his way to the symptoms improving and would report any changes.

                                                Shortly after being vaccinated felt dizzy and developed a headache.  Headache got progressively worse throughout the day.   By that evening, headache evolved into a migraine and needed bed rest.  Also started to develop a fever.  About 99.5 deg.  Around that time, several hours after vaccination, heart began to race and had mild chest pains.  Chest pain subsided a couple of hours later.  Headache/ migraine persisted until the next day.  The following day, 24 hours after vaccination, headache subsided but I developed fever 101.5 deg. and chills.  This lasted about 24 hours.  All symptoms subsided after about 48 hours.

It looks like bee stings bigger then a quarter 3 on my stomach and 3 on back. Lots of little bumps. It hurts very sensitive. I felt like my ribs and kidney were hurting but it is because of the nerves when I touch them.  This is been about a week. I am going to call my doctor. The pain is not just one spot but the whole area around them.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

It might be 20A at the end and not 2OA with the letter O.  As for the adverse event, after 24 hours had a bit a sore arm, some redness and hardness in the area of the injection.  Seemed to go away in a day or so for the most part then I forgot about it until last night, 2-22-21 (eight days after injection) when I noticed rather large oval-shaped red mark about the size of an egg.  Slightly elevated but not bad.  No pain.  A little itchy but not bad.  So I googled it quickly today and I find out that it&#39;s not all that uncommon and likely more common than you realize because most guys aren&#39;t going to take the time to report something like this, in my opinion.   I see that some of the health care workers are being quoted as saying it&#39;s probably either an allergic reaction to a vaccine ingredient or an immune system reaction.  In my opinion it&#39;s the latter, at least with respect to me as several years ago after being bitten by a honeybee in palm of hand in fat part near thumb a similar thing happened.where it hurt and was red for a day or two or three and then seemed to recede but then came back with a red mark bigger than before, but it didn&#39;t hurt much, more of an itch if I recall correctly.  So for some reason that&#39;s apparently how my immune system fights off something foreign.  I have type A blood I believe, if that matters.  I think I have a pretty good strong immune system for my age, as well.  Hopefully the second shot will not produce that much more of a reaction because of this or how I&#39;m reacting now to the first shot.  No big deal just a lot of unknowns.  I&#39;ll follow the news on this in the next couple weeks and report back if anything develops further.

I was shivering so bad that I was having muscle spasms so bad that I had difficulty walking on my right leg (hip replacement January 2020). After taking tylenol for fever my temp had gone down to 100. Headaches started soon after the fever and muscle spasms and it lasted well into the afternoon on the 9th along with feeling cold and clammy. At about 7:00 p.m. on the 9th, the fever started going back up so I took another dose of tylenol. The fever lasted until about 4:00 a.m. on the tenth. Currently, 10:00 a.m. on the tenth I feel somewhat normal, just really tired and having muscle pain in my upper back. All things considered, the whole ordeal felt like my time when I was getting better after going through covid in December.

Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.  Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.  The dual combination liver failure patient with depression likely ill-advised     &#34;

Finally had to add a large heat pack to my bed to alleviate shivering. My left shoulder and arm hurt. Abnormally bad sleep. Woke up this morning at 9:30am and am lethargic and very tired. I feel like I was hit by a truck.

                                                The sore arm and mild fever of 100.6 24 hours after vaccination wasn?t a surprise, but the blood sugar spike for four days after was. I monitor glucose with a fasting check every morning, and went from a steady average in the low 130s to a peak of 162, with four days running at 150-plus.  My levels haven?t been that high since shortly after I was diagnosed, and my diet did not change. Just something I think has likely been under-reported.

Patient leaned back in their chair and became unresponsive upon questioning. At this point 911 was called and an ambulance was dispatched. It appeared patient was unconscious for a short period of time (5-10 seconds) and failing to respond to questions. Pt was experiencing mild diaphoresis. Pulse and breathing were being manually monitored. Patient seemed to regain consciousness however was still not answering our questions.

It went away within an hour and I worked a full 8 hour day. By the time I got home it was full blown double vision. I attended urgent care who diagnosed me &#34;Cranial Nerve 4 palsy.&#34; I was recommended to see an opthomologist who confirmed this. I wasn&#39;t comfortable with this and asked to see a neurologist who also said cranial nerve 4 palsy. I asked for a brain MRI as I felt something more was going on. The MRI shown no abnormal findings (done 3/11/2021). On 3/16/2021 I woke up with a drooping eyelid of left eye. I immediately called opthomologist who suggested a diagnosis of Myesthenia Gravis. This was confirmed by neurologist on 3/23/2021. I am now on Prednisone and Mestinon. My next plan is to see a MG Specialist at A referral has been sent to them by my neurologist.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA March 19: Received vaccine. Experienced only very minor muscle soreness in left arm.  March 20: In the evening, began to feel low level general muscle aches throughout body. March 23: Woke up with lower back muscles contracted. Very painful to move and stand up. Very difficult to walk. Could only walk very slowly and in a hunched over position. Changing positions from sitting to standing and vice versa was very painful and would take at least 7 or 8 minutes. Because of the extreme difficulty in movement and pain, went home to rest. Applied hot water bottle to lower back while lying down.  March 24: In the morning symptoms were better. Called the hospital but was told my symptoms were not a reaction to the Moderna vaccine.  March 25: Symptoms were greatly reduced. Able to walk nearly normal.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine, the patient began to feel dizzy. He then started to feel numbness on his upper lip which slowly spread to his whole face and tongue. His blood pressure was measured at 169/83mmHg. We called 911, and he was given diphenhydramine 50mg PO and epinephrine 0.3mg IM. The patient was able to communicate with EMT when they arrived, and they took him to the emergency room.

                                                Severe headache - migraine-like.   Fever of approx 101 to 102 (we don&#39;t own a thermometer because we are never sick.) Painful joints and tendons. Exhaustion (way beyond &#34;fatigue&#34;)  Symptoms began as upper arm aching at approximately 8:00.  By 11:00 a.m. feeling tired and achy with light headache and painful tendons.  Took 2 Bayer with no improvement. By 2:30,  pounding headache.  Soaked in epsom salts bath; could barely stand straight after sitting  in tub.  Went to bed with severe headache.  I walked to the store to get Advil (we don&#39;t keep that around either since we neither one are ever sick with headaches!)  By 4:00 took 2 Advil for migraine-like symptoms and light fever.  By 4:30 back in bed with &#34;burning&#34; fever (no thermometer owned for several years) to the touch.  He NEVER has a fever - maybe twice in the 38 years we&#39;ve been married.    This is completely and utterly out of character for him.  He does not have allergies, reactions to medications, flu or any such thing.  He has missed perhaps 3-4 days of work for illness in the 38 years we&#39;ve been married.  These symptoms, for him, are  severe and are clearly and detrimentally connected to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine second shot.

Hot flashes and perspiration that I have never experienced.  Felt somewhat better day 2 but its now day 4 and I am still experiencing fatigue and hot flashes.  I cannot go out and do normal yard work without feeling fatigued. I am unable to put a full day of normal work in due to fatigue. I never, ever, got hot to where I would have to take off my shirt just sitting inside. The only good thing about this second shot vs. the first one was my arm did not hurt as much at the injection spot.

The following day on Tuesday my left knee area began to hurt.  It was pretty severe pain, it still today hurts somewhat.    I waited until the weekend, and that Thursday I called my primary care at Family Medicine for a Tele-Visit but I had to see another doctor who wanted me to come in on Monday.  My knee got some what better on Monday so I cancelled the appointment.  I got up this morning around 4 am to walk my puppies when I herd the talking about the J&amp;J issues which included knee, and leg issues, I&#39;m now having pain in my right lower leg above my foot.  I did call my primary care again today.

                                                Two days after his covid vaccine injection, he began to feel soreness in his left calf. He thought he was just experiencing a side effect from the vaccine. The soreness got worse and worse until about 2 weeks later when he had significant swelling and pain and could not not walk on the leg. He went to the hospital ED on 3/18 for care. He was admitted to  Hospital on that date for tests and blood thinners. He was discharged on 3/20 but was instructed to return by his PCP for continuing treatment with blood thinners (Eloquis) until she could see him  on Monday - they agreed to keep him in the ED and he was discharged home on Monday to see his PCP.

I contacted my doctor on Monday 4-12 and started an anti viral and prednisone dose pack.  On Tuesday 4-13, I had an appointment with Dr and he diagnosed me with shingles.  I have nerve pain and tenderness, and the rash has grown larger but basically in the same areas.

By that afternoon he still had the cramping feeling, and started drinking water as his wife is a nurse and felt that he may be dehydrated.  Throughout the week he had a Charlie Horse pain in his left calf, and felt that it was getting worse and not going away.  The whole week he went to work and on the 7th day it started swelling and went to  Hospital after he got off of work, and he saw a resident Dr.  who said that his leg was swollen and told him that she was going to schedule an ultrasound.  He had that on Friday on 4/16/21, and was scheduled for 4:00 but due to the pain went to the ER and gave him IV and checked his blood work.  The ultrasound showed that he did have a blood clot and prescribed Eliquis and gave him a dose while in the ER.  He told him that he would be on that for a while.  He is supposed to see the resident this afternoon for recheck.   He is still having pain and wanting to know where he is going to do from this point.    He does work out every day at his home gym and has not smoked, and now wanting to know how this is going to affect his life from this point into the future.  He also jumps rope 3 times a day and now not able to do this.

                                                Adverse reaction started at appx 2 am last night (after 5:30pm shot).   Woke up and had trouble falling back to sleep for 1-2 hrs.   Started feeling body aches in knees, legs, ankles.   Vax site on right arm was noticeably sore.    Had chills at 5:30 am when i woke up again (did not test for fever but was not sweating).   Fell back asleep until 8:30 and took 2 Advil and a 20 minute warm bath to help get rid of the chills.  Slept another hour and then got up for my normal breakfast.   Groggy all morning, but symptoms appear to be completed now at 11:45 am.     I had somewhat stronger  and longer adverse reaction after the 1st vacine on 3/21/21.   I believe the fatigue, body aches and chills lasted throughout the following day and evening.      I had 1 Negative Covid test in June last year but my son and some friends of his tested positive in appx June 2020 so it&#39;s quite possible i had asymptomatic covid at some point in the last year (which i understand from news stories my drive higher adverse reaction rates).

Patient contacted doctor&#39;s office and nurse said he needs to get better before taking the second dose. Some of these side effects he had before his shot because he has COPD already but he describes it as it is much worse now. The doctor&#39;s office set up a blood test to further investigate what it is due to. Patient didn&#39;t even have energy to move boxes while moving locations. Oxygen usually 96 or 97 now it is 92 or 94. He describes really low energy level, nauseated throughout the day a lot, fatigue, feel sleepy a lot , so out of breath and started hyperventilated but it could be from panic attack he says. He still feels these symptoms to this day. He says it goes away when wife talks and rubs his back and when he lays still. BP is little low diastolic in 60s but normally 70s. yesterday 91/62. He says it could be due to synthroid discontinuation which he stopped taking one year ago but started back the morning of 4/21/21 to see if that is what is the cause. He can not raise left arm above shoulder. Having excruciating, tear jerking pain but got his vaccine in right arm. He describes some pain is in the right shoulder.

                                                He presented to the ER via ambulance after he had 3 witnessed seizures which included full loss of consciousness and rhythmic jerking lasting for an unknown duration.  En route apparently he was seizing and prehospital personnel gave him 5 mg IM versed as well as 5mg iv versed which did seem to abate the seizure.  He was apparently quite combative and has no prior history of seizures.  In the ER the patient was apparently having right sided eye deviation and was given 2mg of Ativan.  A stat CT of the head did not reveal any acute process.  Telemetry neurology was consulted.  During his work up the patient was found to have a urine toxicology positive for amphetamines as well as opiates.  Telemetry neurology recommended loading the patient with Keppra, initiating regular Keppra doses and indicated they believed the etiology of his seizures was polysubstance abuse.

                                                The evening of the vaccine, Wednesday, I was extremely tired.  By the next day, my right hip and right leg were throbbing.  I have not slept well since the vaccine.  By Friday, I was so sore that I visited a Chiropractor.  By Saturday, I could not stand, sit or lie down without extreme pain.  I called Dr. on his cell and he met us (my wife drove) at his clinic.  After treating me, he sent us to Urgent Care.  At the urgent care facility I received a Toradol shot and a prescription for prednisone.  Both Doctors said that this was a likely &#34;inflammatory response&#34; to the vaccine.  (continued below)

                                                Patient came for his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Before giving the vaccine, I asked the patient if they had any problems with the first dose and they stated that they did not. After giving the vaccine I went back inside the pharmacy to throw away the supplies and his son-in-law called me over to take a look at the patient. The patient had his eyes closed and head tilted back and started shaking for a couple of seconds. I had my technician call 911 at this moment. The patient has lost consciousness and I took the patients mask off to assess and confirm that he was breathing which he was. Upon regaining consciousness the patient was disoriented and sweating. Unfortunately it was difficult to find out how the patient was feeling due to a language barrier. I monitored the patient until the paramedics arrived which they took out the EKG and injected him with an IV. His BP was 107/62, HR in the 70s, and not sure if I overheard correctly but bloodsugar of 163. The EKG report stated that the patient was having a STEMI but when they printed it out there was no ST elevation. The paramedics took care of the situation and took him in for further evaluation.

                                                Received my second shot on the late morning of yesterday (Thursday).  My arm was getting pretty sore by the time I went to bed (I could not sleep on my left side).  When I woke up, started feeling fuzzy and got the chills.  Took three 325 mg Acetaminophen in the morning.  Was running a low grade fever by lunch time (99.9 degrees) and was feeling like I had the flu.  Joints are sore, head still fuzzy, feel a little light headed when I move around too much.  Took three more 325 Acetaminophen after lunch.  No appetite, stomach feels queasy.  Tired but can&#39;t sleep.  Intend to take more acetaminophen this evening before bed.  Hopefully tomorrow my symptoms will start to go away.

                                                Peripheral Neuropathy: 3 years ago I had an adverse reaction to Ciproflaxacin of intense peripheral neuropathy. That lasted for about 1.5 to 2 years but had abated.  After my second dose of Moderna my peripheral neuropathy has returned. Now when I exert myself I get intense PN in arms and sometimes legs.  I also get fatigued easily.  This reaction has not abated so far from April 1 to May 1.

                                                I suffered relatively severe reaction to the 2nd Moderna dose:  Very sore arm for 4 or 5 days, several hours of chills 14 hours after the injection, and swollen lymph nodes, including an egg-sized lump under the left arm that persisted for a week.  However, the significant event was a seizure 10 days after the injection.  This was a first seizure with no prior history or obvious cause.   Seizure began while I was asleep.  Wife heard odd noises, couldn&#39;t wake me and called 911.  I woke up in an ER hours later.  Neurologist said the MRI was clear, but EEG showed unusual activity in the left temporal lobe.  Prescribed Keppra (ongoing) and speculated that the seizure might be related to aging. He thought the timing of the event 10 days after the CoViD vaccine was coincidental.  However, I am reporting it out of an abundance of caution.

                                                Same day as 1st vaccine shot I started getting nauseous after dinner. The next morning I woke up with dizziness, nausea, and muffled hearing in my left ear. The 2nd morning after the vaccine shot my left ear was almost completely muffled and the sounds I did hear were frequency distorted to the point I could not understand verbal speech from that ear. During the course of that day my right ear started getting muffled also. The night between the 2nd and 3rd day after the vaccine shot I woke up around 2 am with a severe case of vertigo while laying flat on my back in bed. I immediately felt hot all over and my entire body started sweating. I attempted to do an Epley maneuver with partial success. I eventually got up and took a Zertec-D and tried a second Epley maneuver on the floor in the living room. I was not able to go back to sleep and I made it through the day and the next night by taking another Zertec-D before bedtime.  The 4th day after the vaccine shot I did not take any medications and just stayed in bed or in a recliner all day. The night between the 4th and 5th day after the shot I again woke up around 3am with the worst vertigo ever and by 6am I told my wife I needed to go to the hospital. During the whole time the dizziness and nausea never abated. I was checked into Hospital on the morning of the 5th day after taking the vaccine shot and was transported to  in  for an MRI.

On the 4th day, woke up in the middle of the night to elevated blood pressure (160/100) with skipping heart beats. Arrythmia was intermittent but persistant for about 14 days, interspersed with several bouts of elevated blood pressure lasting for about 1 hour. Sensation of pounding heart with skipping, but normal blood pressure, has lessened with time, but is still present.  Saw my GP about 10 days after the 2nd dose. Heart rhythm was normal during the visit, so no action was taken.

Stomach upset if I eat or if I do not eat. I am only able to eat very bland food since anything else upsets my stomach. I can not drink carbonated beverages since they upset my stomach. As of yesterday I started getting little red sores on my back. This morning it moved to my chest in addition to my back.

Staff member was given water, snack and received 25mg PO of Benadryl along with 30 minutes of observation. At the end of 30 minutes, staff member stated that he still felt a little light headed but felt it was better. Staff returned to work.

Staff member then became increasingly disoriented, hyperventilating,  and unable to answer questions, vital signs were stable, 2 L O2 via nasal canula was started for patient comfort which did provided improvement and he became more responsive. 911 was called to have him transported to a medical facility for further evaluation. He has since recovered.

As of today pain is still there it is not as bad but still there 27 days later.  Also my left thumb is numb and sometimes radiates to the forearm area.  I have just started taking 200 mg ibuprofen as needed.  Helps with the right elbow but no relief to the left thumb.  I am due for 2nd vaccine tomorrow!

After 45 minutes the redness abated and I came home,    1 March 2021 I came down with COVID symptoms with dizziness, blurry vision, redness, ringing in the ear and flu like symptoms of body aches.   Then the neuralgia in the dextral ulnar nerve increased and clawing started.  Then same happened on the sinistral ulnar nerve and Carpal tunnel in the other finders.  I feared going to sleep for fear of awaking with paralysis.  I drank vodka to calm myself down and Xanax to sleep (I know it is a dangerous combination).  2 March the red skin continues and when I awoke at 13:30 today I was still extreme and I called 911.  The EMS visited and determined my blood pressure and pulse were normal.  The dextral  ulnar nerve problems continue,

                                                I began to experience lightheadedness, generalized weakness and confusion. My handwriting changed. These faded over the afternoon only to recur at the same time next morning, resolving in the afternoon once again. I was afraid i was having a heart attack and called 911 and was taken to Hospital where I ruled out for an MI. In the ambulance i received four baby aspirin. I was discharged that night. The next morning, i  developed poor balance and fell twice while walking. Weakness also recurred with confusion. I could not stand myself up. I went to another Hospital and spent the night in Observation. The next morning no symptoms occurred but I refrained from walking as much as possible that day. At hospital I received IV fluid and my usual medications. Neurology consultation revealed possibly abnormal reflexes and poor balance. I received a cane from physical therapy. Since then symptoms have mostly not resolved but weakness and falls have recurred. Evaluation for fall and poor balance continues to date. I received the second dose of the Moderna immunization as scheduled without incident.

                                                On Monday, March 9th, I tested positive for the COVID antibodies and believe it was linked to an illness that I experienced last fall (COVID test was not administered at that time).  Approximately 16 hours after receiving the first injection of COVID-19 MODERNA I began to experience joint pain/stiffness, muscle soreness,  headaches, nausea, chills, sweats, malaise, heart racing, numbness to the fingers on my left hand, etc.  I became progressively worse until become bed ridden at 5:15 pm on Thursday, March 11th.  I remained bed ridden with symptoms becoming progressively worse until Friday evening, March 12th.  At that point, my condition began to improve.  I began to feel somewhat better by mid-morning on Saturday, March 13th.  My condition finally improved to ~90% by Monday, March 15th, with lingering muscle soreness and loss of feeling to the fingers on my left hand remaining.

                                                Approximately 6 hours following vaccine I started to experience  more extensive discomfort in areas where I had metal implants and past surgeries ie. cervical spine, femur, thorasic spine and increased pain in areas that I have athritus to the point I could not sleep.  I finally fell asleep at 6:00 am after a hot shower and woke up  at 10:00 am with reduced pain.  It appeared to affect areas of  past and present injuries.

                                                The day of the shot, we noticed significant swelling in my neck on the right of center.  The swelling has maintained its size for now six weeks and one day.  I have a dull numbness in my 2-3 smaller toes of my left foot.  Sometimes I feel this numbness in my right foot, but not always.  My left arm and two smallest fingers also feel funny.  There is a dull pain in my left arm and dull numbness in my left smaller fingers.  The outside of my left leg also at times shares this numb feeling.  On the day I got the shot I immediately felt like I had a dose of caffeine, though that feeling passed after a couple of hours.  It did not feel significant enough to keep me from driving or leaving the facility, but it was noticeable. I experienced diarrhea for about a week and a half. For the first week after the shot I alternated nights of not being able to stay still sleeping, keeping me awake almost the entire night, 3 of the first 6 nights.  I visited my family doctor within one week of the first shot.  He advised me not to get the second shot and made note of the swelling in my neck. I visited him at five weeks because the swelling in my neck and numb feeling has not changed.  He scheduled a CT Scan which has been scheduled.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was a 59-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed Bell&#39;s palsy (facial paralysis).   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 12 Jan 2021, approximately seven days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 19 Jan 2021, the patient developed Bell&#39;s palsy. As per patient, there was loss of taste, his eyeball was not moving, he had facial pain and he could not raise right side of his lips. The patient stated that his symptoms were still on going at the time of report. Both his PCP and neurologist can not confirm this is not related to vaccine.  Treatment for the event included a seven-day course of Valtrex and Prednisone.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.  The event, Bell&#39;s palsy, was considered not recovered/not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Approximately 2-3 hours after getting shot I started to feel flush my temperature was slightly higher than my normal at 98.9 (my normal is about 97.7). I also felt a little tired, I work 2nd shift so I went to work as normal. About 4 or 5pm the fatigue started to worsen and it was difficult to do my job I also felt nauseous, I struggled to finish my shift because of the fatigue. When I came home at 11pm I went straight to bed. When I awoke in the morning the fatigue was worse and it was difficult to stay awake but the nausea had passed. I was extremely tired all day until about 8pm or so when the fatigue started to lessen. By the next morning I was still a little tired but I could resume my normal schedule although I felt like I didn&#39;t get a good nights sleep. By Saturday morning (20th) I was not feeling any adverse effects.  I have sleep apnea which I forgot to list on medical conditions and I can&#39;t go backwards on the form so I am including it here.

                                                I had common side effects including fever of 102.7, joint pain, body aches, headache, stomach pain  from the evening of 4/3/21 until today, 4/6/21. The fever has fluctuated from no fever to102.7, to lower grade 99.1 to 100.5 to no fever to lower grade, 99.1 over the course of that time. The reason for my VAERS report is the major rash that I developed on the evening of 4/5/21 that covers my entire back, my chest, and up to the first two inches of my neck. I contacted my physician practice right away, and recommended that I take Benadryl every few hours. This morning, the surface area of the rash remains the same as yesterday, but is a much lighter hue. Yesterday was deep red and felt very hot. Today, is more of a pinkish red. Today my back feels as if I have a bad sunburn. Clothing touching my back causes a discomfort similar to sunburn. Parts of my back also now have white dryness lines/wrinkles.

April 8, 2021, 1:15 am: Started a severe headache in my office. April 8, 2021, 1:30 am: Stood up in my office and immediately started chilling and shaking. April 8, 2021, 1:35 am: Went up stairs and wrapped up in a blanket and before I could lay down in bed, the room lost all dimensions and started ?waving? as though there were no walls to stop it. It looked like the room just kept going on forever in a completely open space (no walls or corners). April 8, 2021, 1:40 am: got under the covers with the blanket wrapped around me and the bed shook uncontrollable for about 30 minutes. I then slept for a few minutes at a time until about 5:30 am. April 8, 2021, 5:35 am: Got out of bed and still was very cold, but no chills. I put on my robe and wrapped in a blanket and went downstairs to me office.  April 8, 2021, 5:40 am: I took my sinus medicine hoping the headache would subside. April 8, 2021, 5:50 am: Typing this so I don?t forget how I felt the first nights after the shot. April 8, 2021, 6:15 am: Drank a cup of coffee. April 8, 2021, 6:45 am: Chills went away, and headache subdued some. Still have a headache though. April 8, 2021, 7:45 am: Went back to bed to rest. Slept on and off the rest of the day with fatigue, sore body, and headache. Let up around 8pm. April 9, 2021, 7:00 am: Got up feeling much better today.

After 2 hours the chills stopped.  I did not sleep much because of this.  I was awake 4 hours, then slept 1 hour, then got up to let my dog out.  I have been in bed much of this next day.  I still feel like I have a temp.  Also headache and I felt a little nauseous this time.

It quickly subsided after about 18 hours.  While it was uncomfortable during the 18 hours, it all went away in just about an hour (even the muscle cramps).  More severe than I expected, but I&#39;d do it all over again if needed.

                                                In a nutshell, patient was fine, got the first shot of the Moderna Vaccine on 3/24/21, then began to exhibit many covid-like symptoms starting around 4 hours later but 3 times nasal swap tested negative for COVID19 including before and after vaccination. Suffered with various attempts at treatments and tests for approximately a month and then was admitted to the ER at hospital on 4/28/21.  Wife (former smoker who lives in same house and has lung problems) who took the vaccine at the same time from the same lot suffered minor arm pain, aches and pains and fatigue but was fine the next day.  Patient (59) had normal blood pressure and clear lungs in good health, non-smoker, good weight, exercises regularly and strenuously, good diet, rarely gets ill. He works as a ship?s captain and engineer and has worked in boatyards for years doing physical work. Has tintinnitis and in one eye, glaucoma drops but is on no other prescription medicines. Details: March: had nasal congestion, cough and suspected bronchitis, aches and pains, no fever, PCR tested negative for COVID19, and was treated with antibiotics (azithromycin and then a run of amoxycillin), proair, advair discuss a couple of days, various vitamins/minerals, over the counter cold/flu medicines. Seemed to work with most symptoms going away prior to Marcch 24, 2021. March 24, 2021 morning: Got first shot of the Moderna Vaccine at pharmacy. Lot 045A21A at same time as spouse. That morning had no cough and felt ok. Approximately 4 hours later, patient started to cough, felt congested, felt like flu/pneumonia, trouble breathing, aches and pains especially in joints, extreme fatigue, headache, (but suffered no loss of taste or smell throughout 3/24-present) took Theraflu and went to bed early, slept well. Following days, struggled with intensifying symptoms. Felt like the vaccine gave him covid symptoms without the loss of smell/taste.  Spouse experienced minor pain at point of injection, some fatigue, aches and pains which went away by end of next day 3/25/21. Spouse had some lingering cough left over from earlier bronchitis before getting the vaccine which cough/congested breathing continued with no noticeable change. [Spouse was also not adversely impacted by the second shot of Moderna vaccine a month later.) Apr Wk1 &amp; Wk2: Increasing difficulty sleeping due to lung congestion or suddenly waking up wide awake for no reason. At end of Wk2, had some minor tremors in muscles for a couple of days. Suffered from extreme fatigue, congestion, trouble breathing, nightmares, aches and pains. Took azithromycin run then a run of amoxicillin, proair, prednisone, albuterol nebulizer, occasional Theraflu or over-the-counter cold/flu medicines, vitamins/minerals (including heavier doses of Vitamin D, Zinc, C, etc.), probiotic acidophilus, tonic water with quinine or Perrier, melatonin 10mg and magnesium 500mg at night, occasionally a Unisom sleeping pill. Started to lose appetite where rarely hungry. Would force himself to eat anyway, but occasionally vomited it up. Apr Wk3 4/13/21: Patient got another PCR covid test which was negative, chest xray, blood work done at Urgent Care. Showed some elevated liver/kidney enzymes and low red blood cell count/anemia, vague thickening of the plura, swollen lymphnode in the chest xray, no sign of cardiovascular issue. (Some yellow flags but nothing flashing red.) Dr. recommended followup tests and bloodwork and that he get GI/Cardio/pulmonary workups w/specialists. Patient continued to take antibiotics, pregnizone, albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals, and occasional cold/flu/cough medicines, etc. Added SuperB Complex. One day he had hot/cold chills for a few hours. Apr Wk4: While lungs felt clearer, still coughing and now occasionally vomiting productively or dry heaves, insomnia grew into bigger issue with hallucinations not just with nightmares but occasionally during the day where it was difficult to separate reality from dream, trouble remembering, started to feel paranoid/irrational sometimes, trouble sleeping was not due to lung congestion but more due to panic-attack like heavy breathing or sudden central chest/sternum pain (maybe from coughs), aches in joints, but biggest problem was extreme fatigue and tiring when walking up a flight of stairs, etc. Took some Tramadol occasionally for pain relief (but never with aspirin, Tylenol or cold medicine). Could be sitting comfortably watching a mellow tv program but suddenly need to breathe really heavy, hyperventilating and felt need to standup and walk around until it eased. Extreme trouble sleeping. Most comfortable position was kneeling with body bent over a pillow on the bed. [He&#39;d never had panic-attacks/heavy breathing issues before the Moderna shot and doesn&#39;t abuse substances.] Wk5: 4/24/21 feet swelled up and turned purple on the soles. Went for a walk around the block and raised feet. No longer on antibiotics or pregnizone, only taking the albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals/probiotics, melatonin and a OTC cough/flu medicine before bed. Knelt for hours while trying to sleep. 4/25/21, feet more swollen with fluid and more discolored. When searched online, they looked like &#34;covid toes&#34;. Took no medicines except nebulizer and took only a couple of vitamins/calcium-vitaminD and before bed a beer, melatonin, magnesium &amp; nyquil. 4/26/21, feet less swollen and no longer purple except a small line on the side of one foot. Patient indicated he had not knelt when trying to sleep prone during night. But only got a couple of hours of sleep, nighttime hallucinations and panic-breathing attacks. Daytime inability to focus, extreme fatigue, aches and pains, quick to tire on any exertion, vomiting food or dry heaves 2 or 3 times that day, panic-like-attacks with need to heavy breathe/hyperventilate. Wheezing with occasional rattle at end. Coughs sometimes productive, sometimes not but lungs didn?t feel very congested and oxygenation/blood pressure was good. 4/27/21, went to work in morning and was able to perform but very tired. In early afternoon, came home, ate, took nyquil and nebulizer and tried to sleep. 4/28/21, felt much worse, feet and knees swollen, extreme exhaustion, felt miserable. Went to work anyway. Came home around 2pm, ate. Felt much worse so we went to the ER at Hospital. Spouse provided MMC with his medical conditions, medicines, the info on COVID IGG serology test and informed them of the chest xrays and bloodwork that had been done at the Urgent Care center 2 weeks prior. ER indicated he needed to stay overnight and they performed additional bloodwork, xrays, scans and MRIs. The ER doctor called in specialists in Nephrology and Cardiology to provide consultations.

                                                I heard the second dose might give more of an adverse reaction than the first but I felt I needed to report what happened to me because of how bad it was. After about 9 hours from getting the shot I got a headache that turned in to the worst migraine I&#39;ve ever had in my life that lasted over 30 hours. I had a fever that ranged from 101F to 103F that has lasted for more than 30 hours, I also developed severe muscle and joint pain so much so that I could only get out of bed to go to the bathroom and that was with great pain. I also have had nausea that has lasted over 36 hours. I took Tylenol (1000mg) every few hours, 4 times with out relief. I also took a Tramadol which helped a little with the pain but then my fever spiked for a few hours. I&#39;m now on day 2 of bed rest and waiting for the symptoms to subside so I can get back to my regular life.

These symptoms lasted about a week.   He brought this up later after the side effects had resolved.  He also reported a transient amnesia episode where he forgot where he was driving locally and had to have some one come pick him up 2 weeks after the 2nd vaccine.  Both of these side effects occurred after the second vaccine.

In the hospital he was given an injection to slow his heart rate down, said that he drank a pot of coffee and then had another 16 oz coffee after that.   He was not admitted, treated in the ER, fed him and was discharged home and then walked about  1/2 mile to his truck at the supermarket, and finished his shopping.   He has been a little tired since then, has been taking it easy and not pushing himself too hard and not working too many hours.

                                                Had covid infection Dec 2020  He received Moderna shot#1 on 2 Apr 2021: received shot, waited 15 min, went home (30 min drive), went bike riding outdoors, stopped riding after 15 min due to cold weather, went inside, while undressing for shower he noted redness of skin from waist up involving trunk and face, called nurse hotline, while talking to her he felt scratchy throat, was advicse to call 911, 911 responded in 5 min, transport to Hospital, arrived ER in 5 min, given IV Benadryl but not epi. VS were nl on admission to the ER. He denies dizziness, sob, cough, wheeze, chest tightness, diarrhea, abd cramping. Flushing improved over a period of five hours, discharged while still residually flushed. Redness fully resolved over two days.   The redness of his skin was similar to what he experienced after an allergic reaction to a food spice in 2003.    He has covid infection in Nov2020, had high fever, lost taste and smell. Self-treated w/ Tylenol at home, had &#43; positive at Clinic (results verified on Database)   Flushing and respiratory sx within an hour of receiving Moderna covid vaccine #1, in setting of a previous clinical infection/positive covid PCR testing in Dec2020, suggests anaphylaxis to Moderna vaccine. He may have developed ab during actual infection that caused IgE reaction to vaccine.  I advised him to avoid further covid vaccines until further developments  He is most likely immune given previous clinical infection and positive PCR testing and receiving one vaccine.  It is unknown how long immunity will last, what current covid ab titers mean, and whether he might be able to take an alternate vaccine in the future. He might merit skin testing with Miralax in anticipation for further PEG2000 containing vaccines in the future.  Fol allergy at Location Note written 25 May 2021 during appointment w/ patient

                                                Starting within a week of my second vaccine does, I experienced generalized pain in my upper body, especially arms/shoulders. At perhaps the 10-day mark (I&#39;m not sure) I developed rashes on the right side of my face (chin, next to mouth, temple, two places near ear, one place in ear canal. They became worse and more painful as did my upper body pain. I finally went to a Walk-In Clinic on Thursday, May 27 (15 days after my second vaccine shot) and was diagnosed with shingles. I am not taking medication for it to try to speed it along, and the rash is not as painful (five days later), but my upper body is still experiencing the same symptoms as the shingles takes its course. I am reporting this at the advice of a friend because I know of at least five other people within friend circles who also came down with shingles within three weeks or less of their second vaccine dose (in my case, I think symptoms did start to appear within about a week, definitely before 10 days).  I&#39;m wondering how widespread this pattern is.

                                                So on April 19th I got the second Covid vaccine, I went to the urgent care on the following day at approx. 11:30 AM. They did an EKG they said it looked fine and they sent me on my way regardless of it hurting me real bad (my chest). When I woke up Sunday morning, there was a crushing pain in my chest. On the 25th I woke up, got dressed and went right over to the hospital. I was in so much pain I had to go back to the hospital. I was there from the 25th-29th, they said I needed to have an angiogram with a possible stint in my left artery. On the 28th they put that stint in and I left on the 29th of April in the afternoon at about 4pm. I still am not feeling right, my chest hurts not like it did then, but shortness of breath. I also have to take a blood thinner and a baby aspirin. I have new symptoms in both my arms, from my bicep to my triceps is very achy - it has never done that before. My arms are very stiff. I still have trouble taking deep breathes.

With in 2-3 weeks increase abdominal pain, and discomfort, I thought it was a Crohn?s flair, so I just tried to wait it out.  Early April I went to the ED, for eval and treatment , it was discovered via CT of abdomen I developed Portal Vein Thrombosis, admitted for anti coagulation, and further studies like JAK 2. Place on heparin, followed by lovonox SQ injections, and bridged to Pradaxa.  Symptoms returned after a couple of weeks, and persisted, ,back tp the hospital new CZt scans, showed increase in Portal vein thrombosis, but now included splenic vein thrombosis, and mesenteric vein thrombosis.  Went back on anticoagulation therapy, transferred to  hospital for Intervention Radiology procedure to have a portal vein shunt placed in, and thrombectomy of the spleen, and mesenteric veins. Had bleeding issues, returned to OR for a second IR procedure, and finally a 3rd procedure of splenectomy, blood transfusion for hemorrhagic shock.  Discharged on warfarin, and lovonox as needed
