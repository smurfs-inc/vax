He then received the vaccine.  He is not as energetic as normal, lethargic, sitting, resting, no activity, very tired, sore arm, maybe low grade fever.     The facility did not tell them anything to do about giving him the wrong vaccine, father said very cavalier.  They told them to come back in 28 days on 6/16/21 for the 2nd vaccine of Moderna.   The facility supposedly reported the error.     Father states that the facility told him that the Moderna vaccine was going to be approved very shortly, there were no issues with it, they are all the same, and that he should not have any side effects, and to return to get the 2nd Moderna shot in 28 days.

Symptoms were improving, and appeared consistent with localized reaction. Concern is that Pt was underage for this vaccine at time of administration.  Home living agency was contacted, and reported Pt received vaccine at associated agency. This provider does not know lot # and dose administered. The agency PA has been contacted, and is aware of error- would be reporting to county health.

He did not experience any side effects due to the vaccine other than a sore arm.

                                                Patient was given a vaccination of COVID 19 vaccine (Moderna), he&#39;s only 17 years old and 9 months.  Indication for this vaccine is 18 years old and older.  Discrepancy was discovered during billing.  Patient mother was immediately informed, per mother there were no adverse effects other than a sore arm.  Mother is only concerned about the second dose (to vaccinate or not).  A call was placed to the doctor, she was informed about the incident.  She stated that a trial is being done to 12 -18 years now, and was not so concern since the patient is almost 18.  However, she will inquire to one of her colleague regarding the recommendation to vaccinate or not for the second dose.

                                                About two weeks after I received the vaccine (almost a week ago as of present) I began experiencing rapid muscle twitches near the injection site. I can send a video if necessary.  Only muscle experiencing these symptoms is one on my left shoulder, where the injection occurred. Twitches a couple times a second for a couple minutes at a time. Frequency of these events per day has increased over the past week.  Presents without pain, numbness, tingling, etc. No past history of chronic muscle twitches. I am capable of fine motor movements such as writing and maintaining full motion of my arm while it occurs.  Consulted with a doctor (my employer) informally and they recommended I submit this form. Willing to answer any questions that might show up.

Patient was with his parents and he told them he felt like he was going to faint, so his parents stabilized him before it happened.  Patient seized for about 10 seconds and then came to alertness.  He was made comfortable and given juice and a granola bar after a while because patient had not yet eaten this morning.  I monitored patient for about 45 minutes before I felt patient was stable and feeling well enough to leave.  Patient left with his parents monitoring him.

                                                This patient had some dizziness after the shot and was apprehensive in receiving it. He claimed he felt dizzy and in seconds had slumped off of his chair. He was unresponsive for a few seconds only about 5-10 seconds and we gave him an IM Benadryl as a precaution. He awoke complaining of a funny feeling in the mouth and tongue but had no rash or redness or swelling to indicate an allergic reaction. We decide to monitor closely for an escalation of symptoms but to have a EpiPen handy, and call an EMT unit. His blood pressure was low at first at around 107/68  then quickly come up in about 10 minutes to 130/80. With no other issues we believe he had a vasovagal syncope but wanted the ER to make sure we were correct. I called and checked on him after he was at the ER. and the nurse stated that he was doing very well and that they had seen this happen with the vaccine at other site locations.

                                                Pt had a vasovagal response to the vaccine. It happened right after administration. Patient started shaking and closed his eyes. Just a few seconds later he woke up and said something along the lines of, &#34;Oh did I pass out?&#34; I caught him in my arms before he could fall to the floor. The same response where he started aggressively shaking and eyes closed happened a few seconds later. His legs straightened out and his head was headed backward. Again I caught him and stabilized him. Afterward, my 2nd pharmacist stopped over and spoke with him. He seemed to be feeling better, but to ensure the same reaction wouldn&#39;t happen again, we had him wait 30 min instead of the standard 15. He sat in his chair and did not have any issues. We offered food but he was not interested. I spoke w/ him again this afternoon via phone and he said he was doing fine. Pt said he has had this type of rxn before w/ previous vaccines.

                                                seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like; hypoglycemia; some fatigue; sore arm at injection site; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS (seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like) in an 18-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 013A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No relevant medical history reported.).    On 02-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient experienced VACCINATION SITE PAIN (sore arm at injection site). On 04-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FATIGUE (some fatigue). On 07-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS (seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOGLYCAEMIA (hypoglycemia). At the time of the report, DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS (seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like) and HYPOGLYCAEMIA (hypoglycemia) had resolved and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (sore arm at injection site) and FATIGUE (some fatigue) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter. On 03-Apr-2021, patient took Tylenol for the sore arm. On 09-Apr-2021, patient went to his doctor. He got some blood work done. His A1c was fine, his fasting glucose level was fine. Doctor doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s diabetes but had an episode of hypoglycemia. He also did not rule out possible side effect of the vaccine. He has not had another episode since then. Caller is asking if there have been any other reports of hypoglycemic episodes and also asking if Moderna would recommend getting the second dose given the reaction he had with the first dose.   This case was linked  ( Linked Report).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

NP was present and soon afterwards his head went backwards and he syncopized.  He was caught by the NP and he was still sitting in the chair.  NP  proceeded to perform a sternal rub.  Pt did not become conscious or aware for approximately 2-3 minutes.  He never fell to the ground.  On further questioning after patient was responsive, he states that he had not eaten prior to coming for his vaccination.  He has only received a handful of vaccines and has never had the flu vaccine so he is unsure of his reaction.

I had his mom get him something to eat and drink prior to receiving the shot, while I went over the pre-vaccine questions. She was with him while he received the shot. A few seconds after I gave the shot he began to feel hot. He asked to lie down, but never lost consciousness. We had a yoga mat for him to lay on and placed a fan to cool him down. He laid down for a few minutes, but was able to talk and convey how he was feeling. He sat up maybe 5 min later and remained in the cubicle for a few more minutes. He again stated that it was all in his head and that he didn&#39;t even feel the needle.

His girlfriend got her vaccine first and was talking to him as he received his.  They were discussing how little it hurt when he fell out of his chair. He did not respond when we moved to him, but within five seconds he was awake and asking what happened.  He was alert and sat in a chair for 30 minutes with no adverse effects from the fall.  He noted he only slept 3 hours the night before the vaccine and had not eaten anything that day. The patient refused any further medical care.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

The dorsa of his feet had a slightly raised, pruritic erythematous rash that, over the course of the day, extended in places near to the ankle. Though not warm to the touch, Patient explained that they felt hot and painful. There was slight swelling. By 1/24/21, there was less swelling, and discomfort and the erythematous rash had become eczematous in places and thicker than the previous day.  The palms didn&#39;t have an appreciable rash. However, Patient felt much discomfort there (not exactly painful) and some paresthesia. He felt that his fingers were swollen. By 1/24/21, the discomfort in both palms was worse.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine was administered I experienced the usual side effects of mild headache, fatigue and localized redness and swelling  Around 11pm the night the vaccine was administered I developed a migraine that resulted in blurred vision. and when I checked my temperature it was approximately 104.9 degrees Fahrenheit.By the next morning, approximately 7am, I was weak to the point I could not get out of bed myself, I was nauseous that resulted in a single Emesis episode approximately 8am, I had mild swelling of my face since 7am, between 7:30am and 12pm, I had multiple times where I would temporarily lose my vision. Throughout 1/25 I continued to have a fever ranging from 102 degrees Fahrenheit to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At approximately 8am and 1pm I took two acetaminophen pills each time which alleviated the migraine and to an extent helped with the visual deficit episodes. Throughout 1/24 and 1/25 I suffered with extreme chills resulting in shivering that lasted for several minutes despite a room temperature of approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and covered in two blankets. PCP was consulted via telephone and she advised to go to the hospital via EMS given the high grade fever, abnormal vitals and severity of symptoms

Fever, cold chills, trembling, fatigue, that lasted 2 days after the vaccine was administered. The side effect I am still experiencing is a metallic taste in my mouth, that gets worse when I drink water or other beverages. My hands and fingers turned a rust orange color the day after getting the shot and resolved within 48 hours.

                                                Vaccine was administered to patient.  Within 10 minutes of administration, the patient had an episode of syncope and fell out of his chair.  I immediately went out to help the patient and a technician called for EMS.  The patient woke up within 2 minutes and reported feeling dizzy, tired, and numb. While waiting for EMS to arrive, the patient was situated in a sitting position and I continued talking to him to keep him awake. EMS assessed him and took him out to the ambulance to wait for a relative to come.  It is unknown if the patient went to the emergency room or not.

                                                Currently having it. I have a swollen face. Blurry vision. Difficulty standing. Shallow breaths. Headache. Chills. Body aches. 101 fever. Unable to sleep but very tired. Not able to breather through nose. Sore and numb right arm. Tingling of my limbs. Occasionally sharp pain in muscles. I got the shot at 11 and was just fine but I had work. I drove for a little over an hour and progressively my arm got weaker. I did physical labor until 10 pm and then started some school work, but found my arm almost unable to move and my mood was deteriorating. When I went to bed and lied down, it hit me. It is 4 am and it is still going strong.

                                                Developed &#34;moderna arm&#34; (raised inflammation with itching 1.5-2 inches long and 0.5-1 inches across) 7 days post vaccination from injection 1.   Developed somewhat severe tension headache on day 1 post vaccination from injection 2 (all further events listed below are from injection 2). Headache responded to ibuprofen.  On day 4 post vaccination, began experiencing minor and infrequent migraine-like headaches that lasted for a few seconds to a minute. Moderate pain and localized. Pain site changed but was generally on left side. Experienced 0-2 a day until day 12.  On day 11 post vaccination, began experiencing full, moderate tension headache. In addition, had more frequent migraine-like headaches. Did not respond to 400mg ibuprofen or 10mg Claritin.  On day 12 post vaccination, began experiencing photophobia. Mentioned to general practitioner out of an abundance of caution who recommended Excedrin. Took two Excedrin extra strength (total dosage: Acetomenaphin 500mg, Aspirin 500 mg, Caffeine 130 mg). Tension headache ended and most (but not all) migraine-like pain subsided. Some occasional pain ranging from 1-2 out of 10.  On day 13 out of an abundance of caution following reports of other events I went to the ER. The doctor there examined for any cognitive symptoms (asked me to follow her finger with my eyes, squeeze fingers, checked ability to move extremities, etc) and concluded no risk of CVST. Determined that vaccine likely lowered my threshold for headaches and migraines (I have had very infrequent cluster headaches lasting for a few seconds in the past, never for this duration). Final diagnosis was migraines. Doctor prescribed Fioricet and gave me a long-acting steroid. Some pain is still there, but symptoms have mostly stopped. Waves of quick bursts of pain on localized areas on the left side of my head are still occuring.

                                                Patient had parked in the COVID vaccine waiting area, and was observed to fall forward onto his steering wheel within a few minutes of parking by 2 other participants waiting in the car next to him. One of them immediately notified one of the parking lot volunteers who came and got me within 1 minute of this observation. 2 students and I came quickly to the open drivers side door and began talking to assess the situation. Mr. Bannister appeared pale, mildly diaphoretic (sweating) and slightly confused as to the passage of time, but was able to state and spell his name and talk coherently about his circumstances. He stated that he was not allergic to anything that he knew about, and that he had no prior history of similar reactions to vaccines or medicines although he had not taken any shots in several years. He noted that he had not eaten anything since breakfast (now mid-afternoon). He described himself as initially feeling weak, faint, and nauseated with his vaccinated arm feeling heavy and numb. He also reported that he had a sensation of blurriness before passing out, but denied any spinning sensation, visual loss or ringing in the ears. There were no obviously visible abrasions or bleeding on his face or forehead. The nursing students brought a chair, and we elevated his legs and gave him some water to drink during the time we were monitoring his vital signs. He refused a cupcake because of the nausea, but as time progressed he gained facial color and was more comfortable in conversing. His hands had equal muscle grip and strength, visible fingernail beds were pink and his capillary refill was less than 3 seconds. Towards the end of our monitoring, he did accept some nuts and M &amp; Ms to eat. A University Safety Medical Report was completed by the appropriate safety personnel. He was fully AAO x 3 at the end of our monitoring, and stated that if he felt better he would drive to his apartment (less than 5 minutes away) but would wait for his girlfriend to get out of class if he did not feel fully capable of driving. We encouraged him to eat something light when he got home, to use cool water/warm water soaks at his shot site, exercise his arm, and to take an NSAID for pain relief the next day. We recommended that he eat something light before his second shot (which had already been scheduled), that he bring someone with him the next time, and as a precaution to wait 30 minutes following the second shot. He left at 3: 15 pm driving his car without any apparent difficulties. An online report was completed for the incident 04/20/2021.

He was pale, diaphoretic and felt weak.  However, he was alert and speech was clear. Within 5 minutes his palor improved and the diaphoresis and weakness began to improve. Cold ice packs were applied. No treatment given.  The patient reported he &#34;has done this before.&#34; He remained onsite for 1 hour, at which time he reported he &#34;felt normal&#34;. Also, I spoke with him by phone at 5:30 pm and he stated &#34; I made it home fine and I&#39;m good&#34;.

                                                i had regular symptoms the day of and after my vaccine. Headaches, body ache, tired, sore arm, slight difficulty breathing, and slightly faster heart rate. Those didn&#39;t really concern me since i took it as the vaccine is working like it?s supposed to. but starting yesterday when i woke up until this moment i?ve had a really weird pinching feeling by my heart and the side of my rib cage on the left side of my chest. that?s the only thing scaring me now since my other side effects have already gone away.

                                                19 year old patient came to pharmacy with dad to get first dose of Moderna Vaccine. Questionnaire was completed online with no&#39;s to all questions. Patient was sitting in booth and seemed comfortable while getting vaccine, but immediately after started to lean towards wall and faint. Patient&#39;s father and I supported patient so he didn&#39;t fall and injure himself. Patient was nonresponsive for about 5 to 10 seconds before he became responsive. He was able to sit by himself after about 1 minute of support from his dad. Patient was given water and waited 15 minutes in the booth while being monitored. He seemed to be himself after about 5 minutes. During those 15 minutes I talked to patient&#39;s dad about patient&#39;s medical history. He may had 1 seizure when he was younger due to ADHD medication but test results did not confirm it as a seizure. He also passed out one time in high school while watching biology movies with blood. Discussing this incident with the father and patient, we agreed this patient seems to have suffered from syncope due to fear of needles. I gave his father my business card and told him to call me if the patient reported any symptoms after leaving or if he had any questions whatsoever. I let them know I would be reporting this to VAERS and encouraged him to follow up with his PCP about this incident.

He has been having hot and cold flashes since then.  He has had a poor appetite.  He has had a dry mouth and trouble sleeping.  One day prior to admission, he then developed a chest pain that became constant and persisted, so he came into the emergency department on 05/19/2021 for further care. He has developed myocarditis after receiving the first of his Moderna Coronavirus Disease 19 vaccines.

Both technician and I did not see the date on vaccine card when patient was previously received at .  I administered second dose for him after asking him about the first dose, and counseled him on adverse effects.  When we processed the prescription later in the afternoon, insurance rejected prescription and stated earlier than 24 days.  I found patient had received the dose on 5/4/21.  Patient and did not answer the phone, and patient called back confirming the date of first dose given on 5/4/21.  Patient did not feel anything except a sore arm, and did not have PCP.

                                                The patient received his vaccine and 5 minutes later complained of feeling dizzy. He was instructed to sit and before we could help him into a chair he lost consciousness and fell. His fall was somewhat controlled by the technician. I then assessed the patient and determined he had a vasovagal episode and lifted his legs, he returned to consciousness within 10 seconds of raising his legs. I then allowed the patient to lie on the floor for approximately 20 minutes after which he felt better and returned to sitting . He then sat for about 15 more minutes until a family member was able to arrive. The patient reported no other adverse effects other than dizziness, lightheadedness, some trouble hearing and tingling fingers.

He was offered dihpenhydramine but refused because he stated that he had to leave to go to work.   He said that he was stopping by his house before work so he would take diphenhydramine if he needed to at home.  I told the patient he should wait at the pharmacy longer for observation but he still left because he had to go work.  He said that he felt okay before leaving the pharmacy.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included asthma, and allergy to egg, peanut and tree nuts. Concomitant medications reported included dupilumab, montelukast, budesonide / formoterol, cetirizine, albuterol and epinephrine.  On 29 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 028L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, the patient reported soreness of the arm for 3 to 4 days.  On 30 Jan 2021, the patient presented to the hospital with acute onset of left sided chest pain. The physician reported that the patient developed myocarditis. Consent for Safety to follow up was received.  Treatment for the events, as reported, included patient&#39;s concomitant medications of dupilumab, montelukast, budesonide / formoterol, cetirizine and albuterol. No additional treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event, soreness of the arm, was resolved on unknown date. The event acute onset of chest pain and myocarditis was not resolved at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 20 year old male with medical history of multiple allergies, who was hospitalized with serious unexpected events of chest pain and myocarditis and a non-serious unexpected event of pain in extremity.  The chest pain and myocarditis occurred 33 days after first dose and 4 days after last dose of mRNA-1273.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Around 2pm on that following Sunday (4 days after) I suddenly come down with a fever and headache. I felt so tired, but I took Tylenol and I felt better through the following day. Now, on Tuesday almost a whole week after my shot I get this itching on my chest and arms. Turned out that I got hives, I am not aware of any allergies and I have only broken out into hives one other time in my life and it was 8 years ago and I still do not know the cause. It is now Thursday and the hives have somewhat gone down but I still feel the itchiness around my body. Also to note that the itches are almost about my waist (arms, chest, stomach, back, and neck) I also used the itching cream to relive the itching but I am so tired of the feeling on my body.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the Moderna vaccine, this writer was called to the patient room by other staff.  The patient was extremely confused and not speaking to anyone.  He was gazing to the left and not making eye contact with this writer, who was loudly talking to the patient.  Multiple attempts were made to get the patient&#39;s attention with no success.  The patient then began to involuntarily raise his bent left arm in front of his face and then back down to his side.  In this writer&#39;s opinion, the patient was having a silent seizure.  This writer sat with the patient, who became aware approximately 15 seconds later.  He was able to answer questions and was quickly reoriented.  At this point this writer had the staff call 911 for further evaluation.  After answering basic questions appropriately., this writer gathered vital signs on the patient .  The first set of vitals were:   bp 88/48, pulse 60, respirations 14/min, oxygen saturation 93% on room air, temp 98.5.  After small conversation with the patient, another set of vitals were taken:   bp 94/70, pulse 68, respirations 15/min, oxygen saturation 95% on room air, temp 98.8.  We then had the patient drink some water, then had him lie down in the patient room until EMS arrived.  By the time they arrived, the patient was completed reoriented and laughing with office staff.  EMS evaluated the patient and deemed him safe to go home with his friend driving.  This writer walked the patient to the car to assess balance and coordination.  This writer informed the patient and his friend to call 911 if symptoms returned.  The patient agreed.

                                                Patient reports routinely having spells of syncope with injections and still insisted on receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Gave injection into left deltoid. Had patient scoot up to table in immunization room with both legs fully under the table just in case there was an issue. I set the timer for 15 minutes and left him in the immunization room with his girlfriend, who also received a vaccine. A few moments later the girlfriend asked for our help stating he was feeling like he was going to pass out. I went into the IMZ room and checked with him. At the time, he was sweaty with a rapid hearbeat. I instructed him to take some deep breaths and went to get a cold paper towel to apply to his head. When I returned he had passed out, not responsive but still breathing, in his chair and his girlfriend was holding his head in her hand. We gently lowered his head to rest on the table while another associate called 911 per girlfriend&#39;s request. He began moaning a few moments later and was able to talk to us. He was very hot and sweaty, light headed and breathing rapidly. We applied a cooling pack to his forhead as he continued to lie his head on the table. He then said he might feel more comfortable lying on the floor. We assisted him to the floor, elevated his feet on a chair and placed his head on a roll of paper towels. At that time the paramedics showed up and said his blood pressure was fine and he was just having some hyperventilation. The paramedics got him back up in the chair and his girlfriend got him some apply juice. After about 30 minutes he was talking fine, shaking had stopped and his breathing a temp went back to normal

A friend with the pt. stated that he fell out of the chair he was sitting in but did not hit his head on the floor. EMS and an on-scene Dr. made immediate pt. contact. It was determined that the pt. experienced a syncopal episode. He was already regaining consciousness upon arriving at his side. Vitals were taken and pt. recovered over time. Pt. signed an AMA and was taken home by a friend.

When I brought the water to him he was very pale and said he felt like fainting.  We had him lay down and elevate feet which helped him feel better but was still hot so I applied a cold ice pack on head to help him feel less hot.  After about 10-15 minutes he felt better and stayed with us for about 45 mintues until he felt well enough to drive home.  I checked on him about 2 hours later and he was feeling much better.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the first dose of my vaccine at about 8:30am on January 12. Around 6pm on January 12 I started to experience chills. As the night went on the chills got worse and I developed a terrible throbbing headache. In addition to that I was feeling hot and sweating profusely. I fell asleep around 10pm and woke up around 11pm, at this time the headache was worse, the chills were getting better, and I was still hot and drenched in sweat. I was able to fall back to sleep shortly after. I then woke up at 1am on the 13th, I still had a headache, the chills were gone, I was still hot and sweaty. At this time I also started vomiting. I preceded to vomit until there was nothing left in me and went back to bed. I woke up at 3am and proceeded to dry heave as there was nothing left to come up. My headache was extremely bad at this point and I was still hot and sweaty. I could not keep down Tylenol so I used a cold wet rag to help with the headache. I was finally able to sleep again. I woke up at 5am still with a headache and still hot at this time I was able to take my temperature and it was 99.8. I fell asleep again and woke up at 9am with a temperature of 100.1, at this time I was able to take Tylenol and keep it down which broke my fever and alleviated the headache. Now at about 1pm on the 13th I am still only able to sip liquids and my stomach is upset. This was the sickest I have been in a long time. I have spoken on the phone with a triage nurse at my doctors office and I am waiting for her to consult with a doctor and call me back.

                                                I obtained my booster shot on my left deltoid at 2:30 PM 2/4/2021. I had slight soreness in my arm til 8:00 which the soreness disappeared. Around 2:00 AM, I was awakened by a pounding headache, fever of 102, and my upper left chest (unilateral between the midline of my left chest and the axillary region) started to hurt. I took Tylenol 1000 mg at 3 and took a hot bath (recommended by  friend who also displayed a fever and headache). After a while, my fever began to lower but my headache and chest pain did not disappear and I could not sleep until 7 AM. I woke up today (2/5/2021) at 10 AM with a fever of 101.4, another pounding headache, and still unilateral chest pain. I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol around 10:30 AM and it only helped with the fever. I went back to sleep and slept until 4 PM. I understand that the fever and headache are normal symptoms but my chest pain does not seem like muscle soreness. It doesn&#39;t hurt when I touch it, it comes and goes every few seconds, I have 4 or 5/ 10 on the pain scale for most of the pain but it turns into 6 or 7/10 occasionally (10 being the worst pain). What does help with my pain when it is 6 or 7/10 is when I clench my chest really hard like I am flexing it. It is a sharp pain that stays for a few seconds before it disappears and it feels like a deep pain. I didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol again because I am about to max out (can only take 2 more capsules until 2:00 AM because it states not to take more than 6 capsules in 24 hours, and each capsule is 500 mg) (Also, the Tylenol does not help with the pain so I am only taking it for my fever.) I was wondering if anyone else reported this and if this is an adverse side effect.  This has not cause any issues regarding my breathing but just pain.

                                                Vaccine was Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 4 days after receiving the vaccine, two hours after I woke up, I began to have mild chest pain in the center of my chest. After that, the pain started to grow and grow until it was extreme pain, at around an 8/10. The pain radiated from my chest to the undersides of my arms. After two hours of pain, it started to subside and eventually was gone. There was no pain for the rest of the day. The next day, two hours after I woke up again, the mild chest pain returned. Still in the center of my chest, the pain grew into extreme pain again. This time however, it was slightly to the right and as the pain progressed it moved right until after two hours it went away again.  The treatment I got at the Urgent Care was an EKG and they told me to go to a hospital. At the hospital, I got Toradol, aspirin and propanolol.  My initial Troponin levels at admission to the hospital were 900 and grew to 1300. It lowered for a time, but at the last check, it rose again to 1420 after not getting Toradol for at least 12 hours.

Patient was not responsive and completely limp. Together we lowered him to the floor where he quickly began to regain consciousness and tried to sit up. Patient was fairly alert within 1-2 minutes. Patient was given water, ice packs for the back of his neck and forehead, and ED was called. Patient stated he was feeling much better and did not need EMS, but due to store policy they were called. Patient relayed a history of fainting after receiving tattoos, that was not notated on his form. Patient remained on floor until EMS arrived about 20 minutes later and checked on patient. Patient&#39;s heart rate and BP were taken by EMS laying down, sitting, and standing and was cleared by EMS to leave.

                                                My left arm was sore starting a few minutes after the vaccine. This soreness last through that night. When I woke up the next day, my arm was extremely sore and I was very dizzy. Additionally, my pulse felt fast but my heartbeat seemed to have less strength. My breathing felt more shallow like I wasn&#39;t getting as much oxygen from the air that I breathed in as I should. For the first two weeks, the dizziness was very strong. Now, at the three-week mark, it is more manageable and life is somewhat returning to normal. I visited an ENT doctor and their diagnosis was that my dizziness was not being caused by a preexisting medical condition.  Their prediction was that I would be fine, though looking back, I downplayed the severity of my vertigo. At its worst, I felt that, when I went for a walk outside, the surface was the Earth was violently spinning through space, with me stuck to the surface. It felt paralyzing. My body felt almost stuck in shock. I was afraid I would be stuck with this dizziness for the rest of my life since it was so long-lasting. Now, I am taking ginger pills and am watching my sodium intake. I feel better but am extra vigilant about taking ginger and not stressing myself too much. I do not plan on getting a second shot since some of my symptoms mirror those of anaphylaxis.

                                                Pt Fainted shortly after receiving vaccination. Pt came for a moderna covid vaccine with his friend, both first doses. Pt said he &#34;fainted recently&#34; from a shot where he fainted &#34;for a couple minutes&#34; according to his nurse, and he was sure it was psychologically induced by anxiety. He said he was more mentally prepared this time. After I gave the dose to him and his friend, he got lightheaded and slowly started losing consciousness in his seat after a few minutes.   Pt was alert and responded to our questions. I quickly stepped out to give the pt a bottle of water, and upon coming back to the IMZ room, his friend said he urinated himself. He was less responsive, but still alert. I notified the technician. He started to turn pale and felt more cold. He pulse was weak. I encouraged the pt&#39;s friend to keep him alert while we call EMS. I reminded the pt to keep breathing.   The technician called EMS, and I stayed with the patient to kept him calm, but alert until EMS arrived. Pt slowly felt better after a few minutes (color return, and temperature normalized). Pt said he was okay, and he was able to walk. EMS arrived and tested blood sugar; he was within normal range. Pt did not need EMS service, and went home with friend.

                                                At the pre-counsel stage, the patient said that he was a little nervous about getting this immunization, but wanted to go ahead and do it.  I counseled him on the immunization and sent him into the booth to get the shot.  Technician administered the vaccine and then told Technician that he felt a little nauseous.  Technician told him to stay seated.  A few seconds later the patient passed out and started slipping down the chair.  Technician grabbed him from behind and called me over to assist.  I yelled for Staff to call 9-1-1 and a code white.  I held him from the front and Technician held him from the back and we slowly lowered the patient to the floor.  Technician sat behind the patient to hold him up while I assessed the patient and tried see if he was responsive.  The patient was breathing and had a pulse, so I patted him on the face and chest to see if he would become responsive.  After about 15 seconds, the patient became responsive and confused.  He asked what happened and if he got the shot yet or not.  After talking to the patient for a moment he said he was fine, but needed to vomit.  I gave him a trash can and he vomited.  We gave the patient some water and sat with him on the ground for a few minutes until the paramedics arrived.  The paramedics took the patient&#39;s vitals and the patient said he felt fine and declined going to the hospital.  We had the patient sit in the observation area for another 30 minutes.  He said he felt totally fine and was ready to go home.

                                                Patient received vaccine in left deltoid and immediately responded which looked like a short seizure, losing consciousness shortly, then upon shaking responded by waking back up. Within the next few minutes the patient did the exact same thing and again responded after shaking by waking back up. Patient felt hot, weak and nauseous for quite a long time, he eventually vomited and thought he felt a little better. We called EMS and they responded by checking him over (B.S. 79 and Blood Pressure initially 87/60 but a repeat reading was 105/74 and patient felt well enough to decline a trip to the hospital. Patient was still feeling weak, so we observed him for over 2 hours and he took some water and drank some gatorade. After a bit we had him call his mother to drive him home. Patient was standing when we had one of our interns take him to his mother&#39;s car.

                                                Vaccine was administered at approximately 6:15PM and patient was instructed to sit in waiting room for 10 to 15 minutes to make sure he was OK. He looked fine and sat looking at his phone for approximately 5 minutes. He then  stood and walked to pick up window and asked if it was normal to have stomach pains. I said no and asked if he felt dizzy. He said &#34;no&#34; then turned to go back to his chair. As soon as he turned he said &#34;now I feel dizzy&#34;. I told him to return to his chair and he suddenly crumbled to the floor. I had my technician call 911. After 1 to 2 seconds of being unresponsive he suddenly came to. I had him continue laying on floor for a couple minutes and then he got up on his own and went to the chair. We gave him a cool towel for his neck and had him lean his head forward and down onto a chair placed in front on him.  The paramedics came within minutes and found him to be OK.  After they left he continued sitting in the chair for approximately 10 more minutes while talking on the phone (to his parents, I think). He then left stating that he was now OK and that it probably happened because he was nervous

                                                Pt received the first of the two-series COVID vaccination at 1512. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, he was noted to have severe diaphoresis, prominent pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted.

Pt stated that he felt nauseated upon sitting in the observation area and admitted that he only had a coffee today, nothing to eat all day and attributed this as the cause of his reaction. Pt verbalized that he would not respond to the hospital with the paramedics and was encouraged to at least call someone to take him to the hospital.  This provider spoke with the patient?s mother and explained the events. The patient?s mother stated that the patient had febrile seizures when approximately 4 years old, associated with asthma exacerbations; but pt was evaluated with a neurologist and there were no abnormal findings. Pt admitted that he has a similar syncopal episode after washing a laceration and seeing his finger bleeding.

I was laying on the couch during the start of it for the above events, this lasted for about 20&#43; minutes. Then I tried to get up to go to bed. I was shaking very badly at this point, teeth chattering a lot and I was very cold. I tried to use the bathroom and I couldn&#39;t even stand still to use the bathroom. My chest was also tightening and it was hard to breathe.   I went to bed to lay down and I was practically hyperventilating for about 15 minutes at a time and I would stop for a minute then it would start up again. I tried to go to sleep but I couldn&#39;t because I couldn&#39;t breathe and my chest was closing in, it felt like.   I called my parents in and they sat with me and gave me ibuprofen and benedryl. I started to feel better after about an hour. During that time, though, my body was extremely hot (but no fever) but I was still cold and had the chills. My head also was hurting like a headache and my eyes were really hot too. It was hard to get air and if I sat up I would get dizzy.

                                                I got the Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday April 1st and then 2 days later on Thursday April 3rd I started developing headaches and they got worse and I would say they fluctuated to migraines. Every day I would have a degree of a migraine (which I do NOT have history of) and most days the head pain limited my activity significantly. I had 2 evenings where it got really bad. Once on Saturday April 3rd and then again on Wednesday April 7th. I have had headaches continueally since then. Some days better than others and some days worse.

                                                Around 3 pm on 4/14/21, I started to feel very tired and I started to get a headache. Around 6 pm, I started to experience lower back pain and my legs began to throb and my whole body became very sensitive to touch. I took tylenol or ibuprofen every 4 hours for the rest of the night. This went on until Thursday 4/15/21, when the dizziness and throbbing headache started. Every time I would stand up I would become off balanced and need to hold on to something. I was still experiencing the lower back pain, leg throbbing and skin sensitivity but the dizziness and headache became much more intense. Around 9:30  pm on Thursday, I felt like I was hallucinating and was experiencing euphoria along with a fever. I did not sleep the night of 4/15 into 4/16. I was sweating profusely with a throbbing headache that would cause spinning when I would stand up. Around 3 am on 4/16, I fell asleep until around 4:30 am when I woke up in a pool of my own sweat. The body aches, leg pain and skin sensitivity went away along with my fever. Throughout Friday 4/16, I had a throbbing headache and was dizzy with no relief. This continued into Sunday 4/18 when I started to feel some relief. My headache was pretty much gone but the dizziness is still very much there. I have also an experienced elevated heart rate and respirations throughout the last 5 days.

I was alerted and I helped him into the vaccination room to lay down on the floor with his feet propped up. His girlfriend was there to help calm him down. I offered to call 911, he refused. I grabbed a fan for him, and turned it off when he requested. He then began shivering rather uncontrollably and said his left arm (injection site) was hurting and tingling, and at one point, said his right arm was beginning to tingle as well.  We had him breath and relax, he began to return to normal and he and girlfriend discussed how he must be partly having an anxiety/panic attack. He trialed standing up a few times until he felt good enough to leave the room, all in all about 20 minutes. He sat close by for additional 15 minutes of observation, at which point he left stating he felt more like himself.

He also reported numbness in his right arm and mild difficulty breathing. He then began to vomit. One 0.3mg EpiPen was administered and 911 was called. He began feeling better immediately and left the pharmacy with paramedics.

                                                I got diagnosed with Facial Paralysis (Bell&#39;s Palsy) on the left side of the face.  One of the signs were weakness on my face when trying to make gestures. The day before (May 15, 2021) I got a headache and when I woke up the other day I felt the weakness in my face. By the end of the day around 9:00 pm I went to the Emergency Room and got injected with Decadron, but the doctor didn&#39;t diagnosed me nothing only to see a Neurologist. The other day (May 17, 2021) I tried to get in contact with my primary doctor to explain the situation but I had to wait for the next day for an appointment. By the end of the day (May 17, 2021) I went again to another Emergency Room where the doctor Diagnosed with Facial Paralysis (Bell&#39;s Palsy). He ordered a CT Scan, blood sample and anti-inflammatory.

Pt refused to go to the hospital, he left with his wife and she drove.  I told the patient I would follow up with him via a phone call to see how he was feeling.

When I got to him he was sweating and his arms were twitching. Even though he was alert, he was struggling  to straighten his arms. I made a 911 call and then administered one dose of epipen then within  a minute he thanked me for the epipen and he said he is feeling much better. Finally the paramedics came in and asked him if he still wants to go for further checkups. He agreed and left the store with the paramedics.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

                                                Woke up with a headache and fatigue, as well as soreness near area of injection. Energy was very low and felt very tired. Tried to sleep at around 12:00 PM but had a thumping in my head that would not let me fall asleep. Around 3:00 PM tried to sleep again but being shivering/shaking a lot despite being under a blanket and comforter. Eventually needed to take a hot bath for around 45 minutes to an hour. Took my temperature while in the bath which read 96°F (although that thermometer may not be the most accurate.) After the bath I went directly to bed with a comforter, blanket and weighted blanket and was able to fall asleep for about 90 minutes. Was no longer shivering when I awoke and felt much better. Went to sleep at around 9:00 PM and felt fine when I woke up the next morning.

Periodically waking up every 30min from 1am onwards. Muscle discomfort, sweating, and nausea continued until 3:45 AM, at which point I was feeling better and was able to sleep continuously.   Feeling much better in the morning on March 4th. Temperature was 99.9, then rose to 100.0 at 11am. Now, at 3pm, feeling fatigue, exhaustion. No headache. Normal sense of taste and smell. No couch.

Later at around 6:30 PM I took an Advil tablet for the pain. At around 7:30 PM I took a second one since the pain was still strong after the first one. I took a third Advil tablet at around 11:30 PM. At around 12:30 AM on March 6, while going to sleep, fever-like symptoms started such as high body temperature, chills, congestion and aches. Fever symptoms continued as I intermittently woke up around 6-8:00 AM, and as I woke up again around 9:50 AM the feverish side effects had mostly subsided. Arm soreness has also decreased dramatically but is still present.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the events, included allergy medication unspecified.  On unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced faint, migraine, dizzy, fatigue, disoriented, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea and slight fever. Treatment  for the event included Ibuprofen and Excedrin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The event of faint was considered recovered. The outcome for the events of migraine, dizziness, fatigue, disoriented (disorientation), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, and slight fever (pyrexia) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

This continued for 10-15 minutes while the fire department and physician on site checked my vitals. After being laid down at roughly 10 minutes after the shot, I began to regain consciousness.

EMS arrived and conversed with patient, took vitals, and recommended him to go home and rest as he was finally feeling better; overall, it took roughly 3 hours for symptoms to completely fade.

Patient accepted to laydown and was provided water.  Reported feeling better after that.  VSS...BP 110/70  Pulse 65  Resp 16.  Staff sat with the patient and his dad for an additional 10 minutes.  Reviewed symptoms to watch for at home.  Confirmed with the patient that he felt back to base line then allowed him to leave with his dad. On 4/13  a follow up call was made.

                                                While monitoring post-vaccination a woman yelled from her car window that ?he? fainted. Upon arrival, it was noted that a young man in the passenger seat was slumped with his head on his chest and unresponsive. It was witnessed that the passenger stiffened and started shaking as if he was having a seizure. The nurse was called. It was noted that the shaking lasted just a few seconds and he then relaxed and opened his eyes. Once the RN, received call that there was a person having a seizure, 3  nurses went to the scene.  Once RN arrived at the car the patient was awake and alert. The patient was assessed, and he was able to answer questions. History of the patient from the mother revealed that he has responded to other vaccines in the past by having a vagal response. RN noted that there were no signs of patient being postictal. Patient was alert, oriented and stated that he was feeling better. EMS arrived and assessed patient and noted that he was in no distress. Patient denied transport to ED. RN educated patient on importance of reporting this to nurse prior to next vaccination.

                                                After providing the Moderna vaccine, patient passed out going forward in slow motion and head was resting on table, then immediately started seizure-like action putting him in an upright position and I put my arms out to keep him from going forward and then he opened his eyes and came to. After talking to him while in observation, he mentioned that it felt like he was out for 5 minutes even though it only lasted for about 10-15 seconds. He mentioned that 12 years ago this happened (someone had thrown a rock and it hit his hand and when the nurse went to clean it, he went cold and when he came to it was exactly how it was after getting the vaccine). He only recalls feeling cold. When patient was about to leave, I suggested to him to reach out to his PCP to see if it&#39;s ok to give his 2nd dose with us or if he should be observed in a clinic setting. I did a follow up call a few hours later and he is doing fine.

I helped the patient out of his chair and onto the floor. I retrieved an instant cold pack and prepared it. When I returned to the patient 45 seconds later, he said the coolness of the ground helped. He did not feel dizzy anymore but his fingers were still tingling. I gave him the cold pack to place behind his neck and provided him a bottle of water. I had him lie prone for another 5 minutes. When I re-assessed, he was no longer feeling any negative symptoms and he no longer looked pale nor felt clammy.

The episode lasted less than 1 minute. After this, patient was alert and oriented. Upon speaking with the patient they stated that they have this same reaction every time they give blood. They did not disclose this during the patient question or the pre-immunization interview with RPh. Patient felt hot and clammy, so we got patient an ice pack and advised they stay seated. We took patient&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate, both were normal. After monitoring patient a while longer patient stated they felt okay to leave.

The pain proceeded to worsen over the next week and moderate lymphadenopathy was also been noted. These lymph nodes are tender to palpation. Additionally some Parasthesias were felt down the left forearm into the hand possibly due to brachial neuritis or nerve pressure due to lymphadenopathy.   The parasthesias lasted approximately 2 days.  Lymphadenopathy is now present in the right axilla along with more severe adenopathy in the left axilla.  - PA-S2

I took ibuprofen, but was later advised against it.  The next day around 1300 i experienced chills and began shaking uncontrollably. It didn&#39;t stop for an hour, where i got incredibly nauseous and tired and slept the rest of the day.  The next day, starting at 0700, i felt the need to vomit and had diarrhea. This continued until i fell asleep at 1030. Afterwards the majority of my problems passed.

Around 5 PM is when I started feeling a tingling feeling in my hands, feet, and around the outside of my mouth. I still have a loss of feeling in my feet after returning to work today, 1/25/2021, and I was promptly sent home after informing my management. I still have some loss of feeling around the corners of my mouth, and most of the feeling has recovered in my hands.

                                                Pain in arm spreading throughout first few hours, by 14 hours post vaccination hives began appearing with increased intensity and number. By 15 hours post vaccination a mild headache and low fever of 100.8 developed. Treatment included diphenhydramine to ease antihistamine response and aspirin to lower fever and reduce severity of headache.

He was able to take Tylenol but then the staff noted his eyes rolled back in his head.   911 was called but he was not transported since his temperature was now normal and he seemed  to be at baseline.   He did not eat or drink much liquids later that night and in the morning of 2/25/21 around 9 AM, staff could not get him up from bed.   He was incontinent and had temperature of 97.7.  He was staring off and not talking or responsive.   911 was called and he was transferred to the ER and later admitted.   All labs and Xrays were normal and later on 2/26/21 he was awake and alert.    Of note, Patient also received news on the afternoon he got his second vaccine that a favorite staff person had been killed in a MVA.   Patient  was upset at this news at the time.

                                                I did not feel anything shortly after the injection, but later in the evening, started to develop a normal post-vaccine soreness. I thought little of it and went to bed. I woke up just after 3am with chills, fever, and worsened arm pain, to the point that it restricted my arm&#39;s range of motion and speed of motion. Interestingly, the arm is not red or swollen, but is painful near the injection site, and the area around my clavicle on that side is somewhat swollen, but not red or painful (likely a lymph node). I was unable to get back to sleep due to these side effects (primarily chills and fever). After a few hours of trying to get back to sleep, I took some Tylenol and tried to eat breakfast. I was unable to keep much down, and had to arrange a day off of my internship, and was finally able to sleep on and off for the next few hours.  The symptoms have somewhat lessened, but have not resolved, after about 22.5 hours post-injection. I fully expect this to resolve or mostly resolve by the 48 hour mark. I mostly found this unusual due to the severity of the reaction and after only the first dose, and wondered if my young age could have something to do with the clearly robust immune response so soon after inoculation.

                                                Patient warned me prior to administering the shot that he had a phobia to needles.  He did very well during the shot, but while waiting in the observation area he was speaking to another customer about needles and after she described a bad experience with an iv he went pale and slumped in his seat.  The other customer brought this to my attention and I checked on patient, who had dropped all this things on the floor by the chair and he said he was having a panic attack.  He said he felt very hot so we got him a bottle of water and fanned him until he started feeling better.  After about 15 minutes he said he was feeling much better and said he thought he might have blacked out for a moment because he didn&#39;t remember dropping his things.  He said he had rushed here after work and was hot and tired and that may have contributed to the panic attack.  His mother came and drove him home.

                                                I kept a log of the events that occurred. Notes: 25mg amitriptyline taken nightly for the last month, 200mg motrin I?ve never taken pain killers before this, time is in military.   Mar 18  1430 (1 hour 30 mins after my shot) i have a compressing headache toward the back of my head so i take 1 motrin.  1700 i head home, take 1 amitriptyline and head straight to sleep. ( i have no apatite so no dinner ) Mar 19 0100 The pain starts, it?s unbearable. I am sweating heavily and im also shivering cold. i have a high fever I have body aches which turns my shivering into shaking which keeps my wife up all night. In my dreams i feel pain. I talked to my deceased mother, i hold my deceased cat and i relive some of my most regrettable moments.  0700 I wake up, the bed is soaking wet. I take a motrin and get dressed. it takes me an hour longer to get ready for work because, the pain has sapped my energy. My supervisor sends me home seeing how horrible I look. 0900 I take an amitriptyline and lay down. I ask me wife to close to the storm shutters to darken the room. They are normally pretty quiet to close but, this time they are deafeningly loud. I struggled to get 1 hour of sleep.  1500 I wake up due to shaking so bad that i hit my head on the wall. I then take 2 motrin and about 30 mins later i notice theres a tightness in my chest. i take 1 tums. I know that my body is exhausted from the pain and my mind is clouded but i really wanted to do all of the tasks that i was planning on doing this weekend. All of the tasks end up failing. 2100 i try the tasks again and end up failing again.   20 Mar 0100. I eat a pear and 2 cheetos. i do not take a amitriptyline and i lay down. i have no pain or fever. (Dream start) The dream i had is of me watching myself get thrown around by a ghost. The ghost possesses my body for a short time. I grab some kittens (cats are a comfort to me so im guessing that my subconscious trying to reel me back in) I then wake my sleeping wife and tell her theres a ghost and we need to leave. We walk outside and im in an old neighborhood that i grew up in, everything darkens and im in pitch black feeling my way around a room. I open my eyes and im in a hotel. The front desk staff will not let me take the kittens up to my room so i leave them. When i walk into the room, it?s full of kittens (dream end) and i wake up  21 Mar 0900 I wake up and I have a sore throat and tightness in my chest. The soreness prevents me from going back to sleep and the tightness in my chest causing some anxiety. Once I calm myself down and convince myself that im not having a heart attack I take 2 motrin and some tums and the pain goes away from the day. These could be some withdrawals from not taking amitriptyline since 19 mar in the morning. This is still happening as I write this report. (23 March 2021)

                                                Waking up the day after my vaccination, my right arm was so sore I could barely lift it over my head. I also had minor chills and fever but that cleared up after I took acetaminophen. By Friday (two days after my vaccination) the soreness had reduced but I had developed a 4&#34; x 3&#34; rash around the injection site. It was both itchy and slightly painful, but not enough that I felt the need to take a painkiller. Today (five days after my vaccination) it has finally receded away.

                                                Earlier today, a Moderna patient at 3213 experienced a 15-30 second seizure after receiving his 1st Moderna vaccine. Shortly after sitting down for his 15-minute post immunization observation period, patient X began seizing resulting in him falling to the ground from a seated position to his left side and seizing for about 15-20 seconds. Patient was positioned in a left lateral recumbent position. Code white was called and EMT arrived on site within 10 minutes.   Patient&#39;s immunization questionnaire did NOT have any contraindications that would warrant he should not receive the vaccine. Patient reported no allergies to medications/past immunizations/foods and reported no seizure and/or neurological condition.   Once recovered and at baseline, patient reported having a light breakfast this morning and also having a needle phobia that may have played a role in his adverse response.   Shortly after recovering, patient was coherent and aware of person, place, and time. He remained weak and fatigue and BP readings from EMT indicated hypotension. EKG was normal.   Patient&#39;s mother happened to be waiting outside in the car. One of my associates was able to call her in and we updated here on the event.   EMT recommended, and patient agreed, to be taken to the hospital for further examination.

After 15 more minutes he felt fine and was able to walk out of the store.   Later in the evening he called the pharmacy and told us his arm and tongue were tingling.  He was instructed to seek medical treatment if the symptoms became worse.  We spoke to him later and he stated that his symptoms went away without the use of medications.

He had a brief seizure while on the ground and someone called for help. I ran over and yelled for someone to call 911. He stopped seizing and stood up when he came to. I supported him and asked him to have a seat. He sat down and I asked how he felt and if he would like food or water. He said he felt okay but accepted the food and water. At that time, firefighters that had been shopping in the store arrived and started interviewing the patient. They took his pulse and blood sugar levels. Medics arrived and he continued to be monitored. After several minutes, he refused the ambulance and said he was feeling good enough to leave.

                                                I received dose #1 of COVID and planned to walk through the store to shop. While walking passed the observation chair, I began to feel dizzy and decided to sit down. After I took a seat, I immediately began to feel numbness in my arm which spread to my entire body. I was also feeling a piercing headache with ringing in my ears and my dizziness was extreme. At this point I called for help to the individual who had administered my shot as I had feared I would have fainted. I was in this extreme state for approximately 3-5 minutes. The individual at the pharmacy then checked in on me, gave me a bottle of water and after drinking it I began to feel better. I was then able to walk around and buy some food. Approximately 20 minutes after that event and eating and drinking some food, I felt like I was back to normal. I am writing this 5 hours later, and I currently feel normal, with some soreness in my arm I received the vaccine in.

                                                At 3:15 PM, pt entered observation immediately after receiving his second dose of the Moderna CV 19 vaccine. Pt reported to the RN that he was feeling dizzy (Client reported feeling dizziness after receiving his first dose as well.).  Pt also complained of piercing headache above his left eye and pain on the right side of his neck. The pain radiated down his entire left side of his body. The pt also felt tingling in the arm he received the vaccine in.  Vitals were initiated and water was provided to the pt. Ice packs were applied to the patients forehead and nape of the neck where he felt the pain.  Vitals NOT within normal limits. O2 saturation fluctuating and blood pressure was a bit elevated.  Pt reports having a history of hypertension, but could not accurately recall having taken the medication that morning. EMS was activated at 3:35 PM because the pts O2 saturated was fluctuating dangerously and interventions were not successful in relieving the patients symptoms.  Vitals were taken approximately 10 minutes apart. Vitals were not WNL. Pt continually reported that the pain was increasing and beginning to feel unbearable. It was noted that the patient had increasingly poor circulation in the arm he received the injection. O2 was taken on the opposite arm and saturation levels appeared normal.  EMS at 4 PM. Vitals were taken, all WNL. Patient left with EMS at 4:05 PM and was transported to Hospital.

After receiving the vaccination patient was instructed to wait in the designated waiting area for 15 minutes. After 5-10 minutes, patient walked over to the drop-off window and stated that he was having a hard time breathing and his hands were going numb. Pharmacist on duty, immediately left the pharmacy and walked over to the patient. The patient then fainted in his arms and pharmacist was able to gently bring him to the ground. Patient wanted pharmacist to call and notify his wife which at the time was waiting in her car. His wife arrived immediately. Technician, called 911 and ran EpiPen over to pharmacist and technician prepared a damp cloth and placed it behind patients neck. Pharmacist then administered one dose of adult Epi-pen. Minutes later patient still said he could not breathe and that his symptoms were getting worse. Pharmacist then administered second dose of Epi-pen.

I was shaking a lot. I never experienced chills that extreme before. At 10:30PM on 5/11/21, I took one Tylenol.  At about 2:00AM on 5/12/21, I woke up with heat flashes for an unknown time due to sleeping.  At 7:30AM on 5/12/21, I woke up to a heart rate of 105 beats per minute. This lasted for about six hours. I could feel my heart pounding through my chest. During this event, I also experienced shortness of breath. That lasted for about the same time. At 9:00AM on 5/12/21, I took one Tylenol. By 4:00PM on 5/12/21, I started to feel better and my heart rate got down to my normal level of 70 beats per minute while resting.

                                                Very painful rash believed to be herpes or shingles by various doctors. The bumpy painful rash appeared on my cheek in a perfect triangle that resembled a shingles rash. I also had very itchy painful bumps on my forehead, chin, ears, neck, in between fingers, and all over my privates. Was tested for both shingles and herpes and both came back negative. Was put on steroids by doctor and rash has gotten  better but has yet to disappear. I am still sick from when I got the shot and am dealing with a feeling that feels like my whole body is bruised and painful to the touch. Rash and bumps are unknown by doctors and the one on my fingers appears to be spreading on my fingers.

                                                The patient was administered the vaccination, observed for 15 minutes following the vaccination, after which he left to return to work at a pharmacy. The patient came back into the store about on hour later to pick up some things for his pharmacy and reported feeling a little chest pain. The patient was then informed to keep monitoring the pain and if it got any worse to go to the doctors office. About 2 hours later, the patient called when on the way to the emergency room and reported chest pain and a fever of 102 degrees (at the highest). Around 3pm, which was about 6 hours after the vaccination was administered, the patient reported chest pain was alleviated and that the emergency room treated him for a migraine/nausea with Tylenol #3, Fioricet and Zofran.

Additionally, I woke up the morning after to pain in my toe, which spread to my foot and groin lymph nodes. I eventually went to the ER and was told my toe was infected. I had previously had a small cut on my toe and the doctor believes that the inflammatory response my body initiated from the vaccine exacerbated this infection.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine.

At the time of this writing, my pain has not disappeared but is reducing as anticipated.  Throughout the day of 01/19/2021, I experienced symptoms of a mild fever and proceeded to nap at 5:15 PM.  At 7:30 PM, I was experiencing body chills and felt more defined effects of the fever.  I proceeded to take two Acetaminophen pills by 8:00 PM and my symptoms subsided later into the night.  At the time of this writing, I am only experiencing light headaches (I think) and reduced arm pain.  I believe my fever/body chill symptoms are no longer affecting me.

                                                During the first night after receiving vaccine I started to have SEVERE shaking / full body muscle spasms-hypertonicity that  lasted 60-90 minutes. Required 30 minutes hot shower to calm down shaking symptoms. Initially thought episodes were caused/triggered by cold temperature (still possibility) but now thinking its triggered by anxiety. Heart rate almost spikes to 120-130 BPM. No fever and normal blood pressure is noted when episodes happen.  Occurrences is not routine and seem to be random.  Very concerning considering symptoms lasted for 2 &#43; weeks now. I do not have health care or ability to see PCP/GP without paying out of pocket.   Now please understanding the severity of these episodes, to the point where it resembles severe Parkinson&#39;s symptoms.   Along with those I still have the normal side effects, fatigue  (extreme)  , mood changes, joint aches, intolerance to cold off and on,  and elevated HR.

Laid in bed all day, fell asleep around 10PM. 3:30AM woke up panicking with fever, tremors, chills, myalgia and very lethargic. Got out of bed to get tylenol and was shaking.  Tuesday morning - woke up feeling the same as I did at 330 AM, plus no appetite on top of headache, chills, myalgia, lethargic and slept pretty much all day, felt fatigued. Wednesday was doing better, thought it was the end. Then suddenly about 7-8pm started having chills and shivering.  I would say Thursday night is when I actually felt better and by Friday morning I was good with just residual ?brain fog/feeling dazed?

At around 3am on 1/29/21 severe chills, headache, and fever of 104.3 F began. Chills, fever, and headache continued throughout the next day. At 7am, fever reduced to 101.1 F. Tylenol was taken at 7am. At 10am fever remained and Ibuprofen was taken. Around 11am fever was reduced to 98 F. Tylenol and Ibuprofen continued to alternate every 3 hours. Temperature has been controlled with alternating therapy, although waves of chills and heat flashes remain. Headache was never reduced with therapy. In addition, adequate amount of water was taken throughout the day beginning at 7am on 1/29. Muscle aches subsided around 7am on 1/29.

                                                The day following my first COVID vaccination, I had pain in my upper arm for 36 hours and could not lift it above my shoulder. I also experienced 6 hours of constant chills throughout my body, which came on suddenly around 1PM (24 hours after my vaccination) and was sent home early from work. During the 6 hours at home I believe I experienced body chills, I experienced what I believe to be brain fog. My coworkers described my motor skills (walking down a hallway) as slow and lethargic, and my thoughts being delayed. I do not consciously remember the 6 hour timeframe when I experienced these symptoms. Around 7PM that evening, I remember having a &#34;coming to&#34; moment where I remember the chills subsiding, and being able to think again.  The following day I felt back to normal other than pain at the injection site.

Has slowly gone away since, but there is still some of it left.  About 8 hours after dose, had severe chills, likely fever (did not measure), and lots of shivering. Skin felt very sensitive all over body. Arm was already sore at this point. Fatigue, drowsiness. Felt like a flu.  The next day, large red splotch on left arm at injection site, with red line extending into the armpit area. Swollen lymph nodes in neck. Previous symptoms resolved, except for chest rash.  Two days later, large red splotch on left arm at injection site is now very itchy and warm, firm, and slightly raised.

                                                I began to feel ill in bed. I stood up to get some water. While pouring the water, I felt much worse - out of it. I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The day after I received the 2nd dose of the vaccine I had a headache. That same night I ran a fever and woke up the next morning feeling ok. I was taking a shower and it was reported to me by my fiancé I had passed out, started to seize, my eyes rolled to the back of my head. A few minutes later I woke up on the floor and asked what had happened. I was not sure what had happened.  I felt fine when I woke up. When first responders arrived they asked me if I knew who I was, the date, the president, where I lived to all I was able to answer correctly. I went to the ER and they did a ECG, blood test, urine test, chest x-ray, CT of my head and they said everything came back normal. I was prescribed Keppra and have an MRI scheduled in the coming week.

It is red, round about 2 and 1/2 to 3 inches in size, occasionally itchy.  It is still present 9 days after it showed up.  Has no other symptoms.  Patient is going to take some benadryl to see if it will help with the local reaction and itching.  If it does not resolve he is going to schedule a visit with his PCP.  On his way to a health care coach visit.  I urged him to mention it to them and am also going to contact his PCP for him.

                                                He was ok right after administering vaccination. 10 minutes later he stood up and said he was feeling hot and collapsed on the floor. Seemed like he was having difficulty in breathing.  Called 911 and administered chest compressions. He was partially alert during chest compressions and after 2 minutes of administering chest compressions he gained full consciousness and requested me to stop chest compressions and requested an ice pack to place on his forehead and also requested some electrolyte drink  and they were provided. He sat up on the floor after a few minutes. He also said this fainting happens to him all the time when he gets any shot (injection). He  was responsive and sat on a chair until paramedics arrived. on arrival they asked his couple of questions and checked his blood pressure and monitored his heat for a few minutes. He left with paramedics about 30 minutes from the time of vaccination.

Next morning around 10am, I woke up with hives on my left and right forearm/elbow area, and on my left and right knee area. No other symptoms besides the sore left arm. I took one anti-histamine pill (diphenhydramine hcl 25mg) every 6 hours, and applied cortizone (hydrocortizone) on the areas mentioned every 6 hours as well. It helps, but it comes back every 6 hours. I am worried if it will affect my status on getting the second dose of the COVID Vaccine. I also had almonds, but I never had a history on allergies related to nuts, dairy, and bread.

                                                At approximately 12:45pm on 4/27/2021, patient received his first dose of Covid19 (Moderna) vaccine, given by Pharmacist on duty. During the 15 minute observation period following the vaccine, the patient&#39;s father asked the pharmacist to check his blood pressure.  While the pharmacist was checking his blood pressure (approximately 2-3 minutes following the vaccination), she notices the patient was starting to look pale and shut and squint his eyes as if he was having trouble focusing his vision.  The pharmacist questioned the patient to make sure he felt ok, and the patient said his vision was going black and he was  getting dizzy and lightheaded.  The pharmacist moved nearby objects out of the way to prepare to lay the patient on the ground. When returning to the patient, he was staring blankly, hunched over, unresponsive, no pulse felt on a 5 second check, and had rheum dripping from nose and eyes. At 12:50pm the pharmacist instructed technician to call 911. Patient was lowered to the floor in the supine position where he remained unresponsive and no pulse could be felt on a 10 second check, but chest rise could not be evaluated as patient started to have convulsions.  Convulsions ceased after approximately 15 seconds and patient started groaning and moving his head and said he could hear but he couldn&#39;t open his eyes yet. Patient remained supine and the Pharmacist continued to carry on conversation with patient until EMS arrived at 12:57pm to evaluate patient. EMS attributed  the instance to syncope related to the vaccine.  The patient denied ambulatory care to the hospital for any further evaluation. Patient denied history of fainting expect for ?one unprovoked episode at his grandmother&#39;s house when he thinks his blood sugar got too low.?

                                                I woke up with pressure on my chest and pain on my left arm around the elbow. After a couple of minutes, I began to have a lot of cold sweat, and both the pressure in my chest and pain in my arm began to increase. Then I began feeling a tingling sensation on my neck/chin. After that, I felt lightheaded and decided to go to the hospital. At my arrival to the ER, I was given aspirin and heparin. I got a couple of EKGs and a chest X-Ray, as well as some blood work. I was then transferred to the medical center, where I had some more blood tests and EKGs done. I was also treated with Indocin, Lipitor and Aspirin. At around 9PM, I began feeling the pressure on my chest again, although with decreased intensity. I was given morphine and the pain went away. This event repeated at around 10AM next morning with the same outcome. After that I got an Echocardiogram, and began to be treated with Metoprolol. No other pain events happened for the rest of my stay at the hospital. On the next morning, April 26th, I was taken to an angiogram to rule out Coronary Dissection. After the test, I was discharged with a prescription for Metoprolol.

                                                Pericarditis. Initial symptoms were noticeable upon waking up the morning after receiving the vaccine, ~ 20 hours after vaccination. Initial symptoms: extremely elevated heart rate (~160 bpm). Heart rate fell to more reasonable, but still high, ~120 bpm after 2-3 hours. Roughly 36 hours after vaccination, began noticing soreness in the chest. Upon waking the following day (~48 hours after vaccination), chest soreness had progressed to pain (rating: 4/10), which remained roughly 6 hours to roughly 1400 that day, when the pain subsided along with all symptoms. Later, at roughly 2000 the same day (~58 hours after vaccination), there was a sudden and extreme flair up of chest pain (rating: 8/10) which radiated down the inside of both arms, this lasted 1.5 hours and then subsided just as suddenly as it came on. I went to sleep, then was woken up by another extreme episode of pain (rating: 7/10) at 0230 the morning of 15 May, again extreme chest pain radiating down both arms.

                                                24 hours after the second Moderna dose, I began to feel very weak with a strong headache and a low grade fever. By Thursday (48 hours after vaccination) the headache was very strong and by that night it was debilitating. The fever had increased as well to between 101-102 degrees. Thursday night Friday I treated symptoms with alternating doses of Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen, which succeeded in reducing the fever but did not rid of the headache. Saturday the debilitating headache persisted with extreme light sensitivity and nausea. The pain became so great Saturday night that my wife took me to the Emergency Room. There they performed a brain scan with an MRI that came back normal and treated the pain with Morphine. I was sent home around 8am Sunday morning with a prescription for Toradol. The pain did not decrease with the Toradol and by 6pm Sunday I was vomiting blood and the pain was excruciating. At the advice of my primary care doctor, I went back to the Emergency Room. In the Emergency department they performed a Lumbar Puncture and collected spinal fluid for testing, as well as blood for lab work. The pain was managed with Fentanyl. Late that evening the Hospital admitted me. I was given two more MRI&#39;s of the brain - one with contrast. I also underwent an upper scope of my esophagus, stomach, and upper colon which found 3 small ulcers likely due to the high volume of NSAID pain relievers taken over the previous days. The lumbar puncture revealed that my white blood cell count was 51 and they officially diagnosed aseptic meningitis.
