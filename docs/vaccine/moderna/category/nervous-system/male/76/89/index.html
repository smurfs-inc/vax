Nurses at the facility reported that he was responsive and showed no signs of any adverse effects until 1/2/2021 when he was observed slightly unresponsive and staring at the ceiling and trembling. He had a fever of 101F at this time. The facility ordered labs and a rapid COVID test (all of which came back normal) and started IV antibiotics. A few hours later, patient began bleeding from his eyes, nose, and mouth and was sent to the local ER. The patient refused being admitted to the ICU for possible sepsis/hemorrhage and died the following day on 1/3/2021. All healthcare professionals involved agreed that this was not likely due to the vaccine, but needed to be reported nonetheless.

                                                I woke in the night on Monday, Feb. 1 to use the bathroom and when I stepped out of bed I felt a sharp pain in the outside ball of my right foot. I thought I had stepped on a needle. I could not step on that side of the foot as I walked without sharp pain. I immediately searched for what might be in my foot and found  nothing.  The pain continued through the night and into the morning.  My shot was in the left shoulder. I have concluded this is a neurological reaction (nerve pain) from the vaccine (Moderna). Never had this pain before.

                                                On the evening of January 30 I began having chills and shaking.  I then went to bed and had difficulty moving in the bed.  I went to sleep.  When I awoke on the morning of January 31, I was unable to sit up in bed and had been incontinent during the night.  My wife called the paramedics to help get me out of bed and to change my clothing.  At this time I refused to go to the hospital. The paramedics wheeled me to my lounge chair in the living room.  About 1:00 p.m. in the afternoon I asked my wife to help me get out of my chair so that I could take a shower.  I was not able to get out of the chair, stand or walk.  My wife again called the paramedics and I was transferred .  I was in the emergency room until 10:00 p.m. that evening.  I was given some fluids IV.  The ER staff had me walk to be sure that I was mobile before discharging me.  They could not say for certain if this was a reaction to the Moderna vaccination, but thought it could be.  Within a few days I spoke with my primary care physician, who concluded that I did in fact have a reaction to the vaccine.  She has recommended that I not get the second shot at this time.

His windows werte down and he could not remember how to close them.  He had been there for hours and unrinated in his clothing.  He told the police he was making sure the waitesses were doing there jobs correctly.  Again this was a Shell gas staion and not a resterant.  The police closed his windows and sent him home.  He hit the side of the house with the truck.  Then when he got to the garage he could not remember how to put it in park.  He is still having memory issues today but he can carry a conversation.  Tuesday he could not complete a sentance

                                                Patient had the Moderna vaccine 1st dose roughly 5 days ago. Overnight, his wife woke to him  having an episode of what appeared to be a tonic clonic seizure around 5 am on 2/23/21, followed by a period of disorientation and unresponsiveness consistent with a post ictal state. The patient has no history of seizures. It is unclear if this had anything to do with the Moderna vaccine,  but I am reporting it due to the timing of the episode in conjunction with the vaccine.

This pain has continued since then for approximately six weeks now.  In addition, my right arm, hand, and fingers are swollen, and the tips of my fingers on the right hand feel slightly numb. I have been taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen, but still have the symptoms described above.

It was very sore when I moved them.  I did have a stiff lower back, sore when I get up and down. I did see my PCP and she put me on a topical cream and arthritis medication, but doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s related to the vaccine.  It seems like it&#39;s getting better, but I will make a move and will hurt again.

                                                My husband received the first injection on Feb 3, 2021 he developed a cough afterwards, cough would come and go.   He was scheduled to receive 2nd dose on March 11 and I was concerned about having a cough at the time of 2nd vaccine.  He went to walk-in clinic and got a covid test was negative, he said his exam was normal, they gave him prescription of Benzonatate 100mg he took one and it did not help so he never took any more.  On March 5 while working in the yard he collapsed, paramedics arrived and he was in cardiac arrest, they started CPR,  they used AED was in vfib, he was taken to Hospital then transferred to second hospital.  I was told he had blood clots in both lungs, one in his leg, and possible clots in the mesenteric area of abdomen.  His heart stopped due to the blood clots in his lungs.   He remains in the hospital in the Intermediate Coronary Care Unit.  He has not yet gained full consciousness.

Dramatic loss of cognitive function for at least two days.  After two days he seems to have improved although I was advised not to allow him to have a second dose, especially since he already had and survived well the Covid virus in 2020.  His doctor feels the vaccine may have caused swelling in his brain which caused the side effects.  The symptoms subsided after two days but no one could assure me that he could recover from a second dose of the vaccine.   I have video of the behavior.

I think eventually it will go away, but since my 2nd shot is coming up and it has been almost a month, I thought I should mention it to you and ask whether I should mention it to the CDC as a reaction.  I think this is just a result of the injection itself and not of the vaccine.  But I have never had such a lingering pain before from an injection and so I raise the question.

                                                respiratory and cardiac arrest Narrative:  Patient with PMH of esophageal cancer, larynx cancer, liver cancer, PTSD, A. fib, and alcohol abuse. He received his COVID-19 vaccines on 2/14/21 and 3/14/21. Both vaccines were administered without complications and patient was observed for 15 minutes post-vaccination without adverse effects. No other adverse events noted between time of last COVID-19 vaccinations and death. On 4/11/21, patient&#39;s wife called 911 in which EMS found patient unresponsive with abnormal breathing. Wife reported that patient was breathing up until 5 minutes prior to EMA arrival, but had been unresponsive. Wife reports that patient suffered from multiple forms of cancer, PTSD, and alcohol abuse. Wife believed that patient quit smoking and drinking but the morning of death found vodka and cigarettes in his coat. Wife reports that patient asked for help getting up from the stairs and then laid down in the bed, and went unresponsive afterwards. EMS attempted to revive the patient with CPR but were unsuccessful. Per EMS note patient suffered from respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, then cardiac death. Patient was not brought to the hospital prior to death. It is very unlikely that the COVID-19 vaccinations contributed to this patient&#39;s death due to his extensive PMH with substance use disorder and cancer.

When he presented to Medical Center on 4/14/21, he was acutely confused and febrile (102.8 degrees Fahrenheit). He was empirically treated for meningitis with Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone. His CSF was unremarkable, so antibiotics were discontinued. Patient continued to be altered and required intubation. So far, our other workups have been negative and we are pending the NMDA antibodies. He was extubated 4/19/21 and mental status has returned back to normal and is afebrile.

                                                Arm was sore starting approximately 4 hours. after the shot. I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

                                                By 1:30 am on 2/4/2021; patient was shaking uncontrollably.  This continued about 1 1/2 hrs. then he could not get out of bed to go to the bathroom; thus wetting himself multiple times during the night; Patient was restless for about 5 hrs. but still could not get up even with me (his spouse) trying to help.  He also could not understand how to help move his body to keep from falling out of bed (never fell out but I could not get his entire body on the bed until our daughter arrived around 9:30 am.  It took our grandson who is 6&#39;5&#34; tall &amp; 275 lbs. to help get patient up and walked him into our sunroon.  throughout the day, patient could not stand without help &amp; continued to urinate on himself.  He could, however, feed himself breakfast &amp; lunch.  At 7:30 pm grandson and daughter had to walk patient into bedroom.  patient could not walk without us telling him how and pushing his feet forward.  It took both grandson and daughter to pull him onto the bed as he collapsed when he got to the bed.  Patient slept until approximately midnight. at that time our daughter helped him to the bathroom and helped to change his underwear and tshirt which was wet from having a fever.  Afterward, patient was able to go to the bathroom by himself but was very tired.  He was able to walk outside with the help of a cane on 2/5/21 2 pm.  On 2/6/21, patient complained of his back hurting and itching.  We discovered he had shingles!  Not a full body rash but shingles on his left side around his waist.

                                                I had my (Moderna) first dose yesterday.  Within ~6 hour the soreness level of the shoulder joint (but not especially the site of the jab) zoomed up to intense.  So much so, that simply lifting my arm slow-motion to the level of my eyes caused intense pain spasms.  Last night and this morning were equally severe.  Within the last hour or so, the pain level has diminished a bit.  NOTE: I know how people rate pain is super subjective.  In my case working as a geologist in a quarry a number of years ago, I was struck and pinned by a large boulder.  The ER crew would not give me a pain killer, so that they could monitor how the Jaw of Life was working (it broke, the boulder was too heavy), so I not surprisingly passed out several times from the pain level before being extricated.  Needless to say, this compound fracture of the tibia and fibula accident was a 10 of 10 pain level.  Yesterday&#39;s CV-19 jab pain level was an 8-9 of 10.  Nothing I read before yesterday&#39;s jab, Fauci et al, prepared me for this pain level.  So, is this normal???  My POV is, I think, atypical in this matter of pain. Should I be concerned about a return to normalcy right now (today / tomorrow) as well as for the second dose??  I HOPE THAT A MEDICAL PERSON WILL RESPOND TO THIS EMAIL - NOT SOME BOILER PLATE WORDS.

Patient felt pain very soon after injection and circled the needle mark of the injection site. Patient reported to public health department on day 6 after injection to ask if this was an expected reaction after a vaccine or if it was because the injection was too  high. The location that the patient marked was indeed over the shoulder and not in the deltoid muscle. The RN who gave the injection has not done patient care in 20&#43;years. The injection was co-signed by public health department staff.  Patient reports that on day 6 the pain had decreased a small amount and that strength is returning to his hand.

                                                I arose at 7, took a shower and felt fine.  Then while making the bed with my wife I suddenly felt vey week, needed to sit on the side of the bed.  My wife said my face was white.  I had some mild intestinal cramping so went to the toilet.  I was doubled over sitting on the toilet and in a cold sweat with diarrhea.  There was no nausea.   I felt weak afterwards and napped most of the morning with one more episode of diarrhea, very mild this time, at 10:45.  I did not seek medical help, was able to eat lunch and dinner with no problem, but was very low on energy for the remainder of the day.  I went to bed early with 2 Acetaminophen and slept 11 hours.  Felt better the next day.

About 20-25 minutes after my shot on driving home my left leg started to go numb, time I got home both were feeling the same numbness. [takes about 15 minutes to get home] Here it is 4 days later still have the numbness, but not as bad.  Then on 2/13 Saturday evening I was watching TV, my eyes I started to see colors floating around in them. About 20-25 minutes later it was gone. The biggest thing with my feet and is it OK to go with the second shot?

                                                Patient reports at least two falls following COVID vaccine.  Requiring assistance to stand up.  Legs reported as &#34;giving out&#34; resulting in falls.  Reports being shaking within 24 hours following vaccination.  Reports extreme weakness and needing to be lowered to the floor at least twice.  This is new for him.  Did not report feeling dizzy; blood sugar was reported as normal during the time.  No confusion or feeling out of it reported at the time. Ended up with abrasions.  Patient has been having bilateral leg weakness since Friday evening, patient had Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday.  Wife called Sunday at 0130 after 2nd episode of leg weakness and fall (see previous note). His first fall was Friday evening around 2030.  Saturday his wife reports that he was walking on his own without his walker but did have complaints of fatigue and decreased appetite, which she attributed to his Covid-19 vaccine. Sunday morning at 0130 was his second fall, an ambulance was called and patient refused ED after being assisted by EMS. Patient did not have any dizziness or syncope, just states that his legs were too weak and gave out. Wife states that patient has improved today, is using his walker and walking without difficulty. Yesterday she states that she pushed food and fluids due to decreased urine output. Urine output has returned to normal last night and today, appetite and fatigue have also improved.  Assessment    1. Fall from standing, initial encounter    2. Multiple abrasions    3. Adverse effect of vaccine, initial encounter    4. Generalized weakness  PT EVAL AND TREAT 5. Decreased strength, endurance, and mobility  PT EVAL AND TREAT   I suspect his falls and weakness are due to Covid-19 vaccine reaction.  I think he has more baseline weakness than he realizes- recommended PHYSICAL THERAPY for strengthening and he agrees- already planning to see them for shoulder pain.  Feeling better overall today.  Recommended getting up every 2 hours to walk around, use walker for now.  Call if more falls or continued extreme weakness.

The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                On 2/24/21 woke up around 10 AM due to the need to urinate. He was rigid (straight as a board) and unable to sit up in bed and barely able to move. After about 30 minutes he was able to sit up, stand and walk with a walker and assistance. generally has difficulty walking, but the concern was the rigidity and inability to bend for such a long period of time. After that he seems to be the same as he was prior to the vaccine.  Also, on 2/22/21 shortly after getting his vaccine he had a tremor in his hand (not sure which one) which stopped shortly after getting the vaccine.

Currently alert and resting.  States that patient had his 2nd covid vaccine yesterday AM and then develop chills and clammy skin last night.  Symptoms worsened today and patient became weak and fainted.  Was unconscious for about 5 minutes and while unconscious, mouth was open and drooling and became incontinent and eyes rolled back in head.  Is awake and alert now, but still weak and only able to take 1 or 2 steps.  No chest pain or breathing difficulty and no fever.  Feeling very nauseous.  Caller requesting prescription for zofran.      Yesterday AM 2nd vaccine. Last night chills. This AM feeling weak. Today at 11am he felt weak with ambulation. He fainted. Was unconscious for 5 min. Had drooping of the face. He was unresponsive during this time. Had incontinence of urine. Then became awake but very weak still. Only able to walk a few steps. He is communicating. No chest pain. No current fever. No shortness of breath. BP 107/75 with HR 70. He has been very nauseated. He is drinking only small sips of water. Does not seem like a usually COVID-19 vaccine reaction. Given the LOC with urinary incontinence and sustained weakness, I advised ER evaluation to rule out neurological issues. Pt&#39;s daughter in agreement. They will go to ER.  From Emergency Department:  Patient presenting with chief complaint of syncopal episode which was witnessed by his wife.  He reported the got dizzy and lightheaded and then passed out while seated.  The reported duration of his loss of consciousness was somewhat inconsistent, unclear how long he passed out for, there was however no postictal state.  He was not noted have any shaking or seizure activity, he did have an episode of urinary incontinence.  He has not been feeling well ever since receiving his 2nd COVID-19 vaccine.  By the time of my exam patient states that he is completely asymptomatic, he states he is feeling much better after receiving IV fluids.  His lab work is remarkable for a slightly low sodium, compared to his previous levels which were many months ago.  Unclear of the acuity of this, although upon further discussion with the patient he has been drinking large amounts of water since his vaccine trying to stay hydrated.  I advised him to substitute to some electrolyte balanced fluids and to have his sodium rechecked by his PCP to ensure that this is transient.  With negative testing and resolution of his symptoms he is stable for discharge home.  Close return precautions were given.

It didn&#39;t itch, it hurt when something was dragged over it, like a finger or clothing.  It was deep, deep red and some parts of his body there was no regular skin showing.  Took him to ER, where tests were run, showing his liver counts were way off.  Biopsy was taken of the rash.  It was determined that the rash was similar to Stevens-Johnson and he was admitted for 2.5 days.  They put him on large doses of steroids, which helped the rash.  All labs were headed in the right direction except his liver panel.  He was sent home and returned to doctor in 3 days to run panels again.  All were headed in right direction, even the liver.  He will see his cardiologist to be put back on his heart medicines.

He tried to stand up and then he passed out on the floor for about 10-15 minutes.  He went to sleep and woke up around 5 hours later.  He then tried it again and urinated on himself and he fell down on the floor, passed out without getting up until the morning.   He did call his doctor who was not available, spoke to the nurse and advised to go to the hospital.  He is weak and cannot drive so he did not go to the hospital.  He slept the rest of that day and the following day.  Then when he saw his doctor about 2 days ago, he described his reaction and told to report the reaction and that he would report it himself.  He was advised not to take the 2nd vaccination.  He is no longer having the heavy reaction, his muscles are aching and his vision is  blurred, especially on his back and the shoulder.   His doctor did do blood work at the office visit.

It was very sore for about one week.  The soreness gradually dissipated over the next week, but then began to get worse over several days.  Beginning the third week after this dose, the soreness is mainly in my shoulder.

Nursing home would know.  He received his 2nd shot on Jan 19.  On Feb 17 all was fine and they were planning on getting him crowns at the dentist.  On Feb. 19 everything went poorly.  He started to suddenly have seizures and was not responsive.  When I arrived on Feb 21 he didn&#39;t say much and had seizures that night.  On Feb 22, he responded a little bit and had a big black eye from a seizure the night before.  On Feb 22 he had at least 4 seizures and he passed that afternoon around 1:20 pm

They monitored my BP, took blood samples, then did a CT scan followed by an MRI. Then the doctor saw me and told me that my MRI was &#34;clear&#34;, but that I had &#34;Bell&#39;s Palsy&#34;.

                                                He had the injection, had the sore arm and approximately 3 hours after the vaccination he began to experience severe chest pain across his entire chest and into his jaw, which was exacerbated upon taking a deep breath.  He called his cardiologist who advised him to go to the ER.  He was worked up, subsequently admitted from 2/8/21 to 2/11/21, a lot was ruled out but no specific diagnosis made at that time.  They did note some pleural effusion and pericardial effusion at that time.  Upon discharge on 2/11/21, starting Thursday evening he continued to have pain in the chest, but not as severe as when he entered into the hospital.  Every evening including last night has began with severe night sweats, low grade fever and the chest pains have continued.  Went to see his PCP,  Cardiologist and his Electrophysiologist several days later the following after discharge, he does have a pacemaker, and was told by all three of them that he has pericarditis and that the reaction could have been related to the vaccination.  It seemed more than coincidental that the symptoms did not appear until 3 hours after the vaccine.  Was put on Colchicine to treat the pericarditis and then received a 2nd opinion and has reinstituted the colchicine.  His low grade fever has finally dissipated.  During the day he feels okay, but still continues with the chest pains and the night sweats.  His hemoglobin dropped in the hospital possibly related to the heparin and then put on Eliquis postop, and now discontinued, and received an iron infusion to boost his hemoglobin.  He is scheduled for another iron infusion this Wednesday.    He  went to see GI physician and feels that he may have a bleed due to the infusion.   He has had an anastomosis due to Crohn&#39;s disease and feels that&#39;s where the bleed may have been coming from as he did have an ulceration at last colonoscopy.  He did have atrial flutter due this and was advised to have an ablation, and trying to reduce the pericarditis and FU later with other heart related problems.

                                                I am a 77 year old male with peripheral polyneuropathy.  I received my second dose on 3/13.  No problems on 3/14.  On 3/15, I awakened with extreme pain in my right leg from my hip joint, down my thigh, encompassing my knee and my calf was cramping.  I have been experiencing neuropathic pain in these regions for several years, but, this morning the pain was excruciating to the point I could not stand on my left foot, and I had extreme difficulty trying to sit down because of the knee pain, it would not bend without serious pain spiking.  Listed above, are the treatments I have been using to treat the neuropathy since 2017. Was getting better until now.  Pain today is the worst I have experienced in years.

                                                Patient awoke the morning of March 5th feeling weak, fatigued, and unsteady. He went to his primary care provider 5 days later on the 10th of March, as his symptoms were not improving. He told his PCP there that the past few days he was suffering from unsteady gait, walking around like hes &#34;drunk&#34;, and bouncing off walls. It was thought his symptoms were caused by a low serum potassium value, so he was given a rx for potassium. 3 days later the patient presented to the emergency room where his problems persisted. He was still having trouble keeping balance when he walked around. One of the providers treating him reached out to neurology, who recommended that the patient be started on high dose steroids followed by a prednisone taper for tranverse myelitis, The patient was then admitted and treated at Hospital.

                                                Symptoms began the day after the patient received the second shot. He was very tired and weak. By the afternoon, he was so weak he could not lift himself out of the chair. Even with the help of another person, he was too weak to stand. I called for emergency help. He had a fever of 101, was vomiting, very disorientated, confused, could not understand what people were saying to him. At the hospital he continued to feel disorientated, had nausea, dizzyness, a headache, a fever of 104, was dehydrated. He was admitted to hospital and spent one night. Once home, he has begun to regain strength and other symptoms have diminished. Four days after coming home he is feeling stronger and more back to normal.

                                                Not sure if covid vaccine caused this, but this is what happened - Received covid vaccine.  two days later had violent shakes in the night.  Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for &#34;flu b&#34;.  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a &#34;spot&#34; on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat &#34;pneumonia&#34;.  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was &#34;atypical and abnormal&#34; what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.

                                                At 5:00 AM Sunday morning, extreme pain, achy all over, headache, aching all the way down legs, back, neck.  Almost like having the COVID virus.  Rolled out of bed, could not stand up or hardly walk to the bathroom.  Felt very faint, had to hold onto wall.  Was very sweaty, running temperature, cold sweats.  Just kept getting worse and thought about going to the ER and then decided to put it off until talking to somebody.  Called 2-1-1 and the lady told her that it was part of the side-effects to it.  She told her to call her doctor, and they were not in on the weekend.  This morning, the doctor called and asked if she had Corona, his other doctor retired and got this one the first of January.  Took 3 months to recover from the COVID and was on antibiotics, and told her because he have antibodies.  Feeling better, still having some achiness.

                                                About 4 hours after his vaccine, the injection site starting hurting, but not bad.  He could not sleep on it at night as he felt like he was sleeping on a red hot pocker.  On Saturday he was extremely tired in the afternoon.  Had to come in from yard work as he could not function.  He also had pain in his neck and shoulders.  On Sunday he the feelings were going away, but his muscles started aching.  On Monday he felt really strange, felt like he was in a fog, and his muscles ached.  He could not get relaxed, did his normal Monday chores, laundry and house cleaning.  He then tried to relax but his muscles and nerves were very tense.  He went to bed around 9:30 on Monday, fell asleep and awoke at 2:00 AM and could not go back to sleep his muscles in his arms and legs were in spasm and his arm would jump like a shock reaction and jump off of the mattress, as well as his leg.  It was worse on the left side than the right arm.  This went on every 10-15 minutes for about 3-4 hours.  Around 4:00 AM this morning it eased off to sleep and woke up at 10 and felt better today.  He hasn&#39;t had any more of the seizure type feelings in his arms or legs.  He did speak with Moderna who told him that he was the 4th one with this reaction and to report this to us.

                                                On Thursday following shot. Legs of both legs became itchy. Felt like they were on fire.  skin was still clear. . After applying a some  steroid cream it settled dawn and I went to sleep. Next morning I awoke with spots on my legs, and over the last few days, there were deliniated spots  everywhere  on my body - front and back - with the exception of my face. I thought it was measle, though my temperature was nomal (no fever) . I&#39;ve not been able to contact my doctor.    The spots have becom less definite and delineated, have grown into one another.. In general they&#39;re not teribly itchy, but they&#39;re everywhere. I&#39;ll see my Doctor tomorrow. I have spent the days in bed, not feeling my usual self.  I feel a little better today but the spts (rash are everywhere.

Last night I started developing chills, a couple degree fever, overall body aches much like the flu and persistent slight nausea. Did not throw up but was uncomfortable for sure. Slept in 2 to 2.5 hour shifts then up to pee and back to bed. Finally this morning I lslept from 10 am to 2 pm. 4 wonderful hours of blissful unconsciousness. My O2 this morning was 98/74 BP 135/81/69. I just took my bp 315 pm and it was running 141 high end. O2 was good at 97 but heartrate was 99 and temp was 99.7 to 99.1.

                                                March 3, 2021 SUBJECT: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Side Effects This letter/email is addressed to a number of individuals with a request that you seriously evaluate the below discussion, take action to alert medical staff of your respective agencies of these side effects, and work with the manufacturer, Moderna, to address them.  As the recipient of them it has thus far been debilitating and interfered with my daily activities.  It is my hope that the medical community can find ways to prevent or treat them such that daily activity can be unimpeded.     I will first provide a chronology of my medical history and my Moderna vaccine experience.  Then I will discuss my observations. My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sometime after he was assisted back on the couch around 4:30 am  he must of got back up and attempted to go to restroom because he was found on the floor with his arm and face resting on the love seat which looked as if he was trying to pull himself up. His wife found him in the morning around 11:00 am and he had been died for some time according to EMS. His death was unexpected. Even when contacting his doctors they were confused as to why he had passed away.  No autopsy was done but as of this moment he has not been cremated yet and is at Funeral Home.

At first, he looked like he was having a vasovagal/ syncopal episode: he became non-responsive, stared straight ahead.  then shortly thereafter he started to take be gasps for air, his lips turned blue.  It soon became clear that he was having an anaphylactic reaction. we called for an ambulance,  we administered one dose of an Epipen, and administered oxygen. His pulse ox was in the low 80&#39;s.   within a minute or two, he started to react and started to moan, breathe more normally, then began to speak to us.  His BP was checked and was 118/83.  His oxygen sat went up to 100%. after a few minutes,  We took the oxygen off and his sats dropped into the 80&#39;s so we restarted the oxygen.  We are rural, so it took the ambulance 30 minutes to arrive. He was very stable at the time that he was  taken to an emergency room for further evaluation.

                                                He developed very labored breathing on Tuesday night.  By Wednesday morning , upon waking it was severly worse.  I would have taken him to the ER had I been home.  When I returned home around 11am, he was having a very hard time breathing.  I got him a rescue inhaler to use.  He had a dailysis treatment that day, during the treatment they kept him on oxygen.  I called Dr office to inform them, they ordered a new inhaler and told me if the symptoms did not decrease by 72 hours to inform them.  His breathing did get somewhat better but he did not have his enegry levels that he had previously or his appeatite.  12 days after his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine he went into cardiac arrest in the home with myself and husband present.

His wife came in and said that he was warm with a fever, and also has a headache, no energy.  He has not taken anything for the symptoms.  He has not notified his doctor.  The arm where the vaccine was given is a little sore, but not too bad, just the achiness and fatigue.

On 01/24/21 patient came to the pharmacy stating that he has experienced numbness/tingling in his right fingers and thumb since he received his first dose.  It started with numbness in his pinky finger and progressed over the course of several days to each finger and thumb. This occurred more than once since the first dose was given. However, patient states that this has not happened anymore within the last week. Patient denies any kind of injury, pinched nerve, etc in his right hand/fingers and states he never had this occur to him at any other time in his life.  Patient was scheduled for some type of procedure, however the physician will not perform the procedure until the source of the numbness is discovered.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Urostomy, Nephrostomy and Colostomy. Concurrent medical conditions included Lymphoma (stage 4 lymphoma cancer), Renal failure (stage 4 renal failure) and Neuropathy NOS (chemo related neuropathy).    On 23-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PAIN IN EXTREMITY (arm pain), DYSPNOEA (labored breathing), ASTHENIA (very weak), RASH (got rash on both of his forearms), HEADACHE (headaches), FATIGUE (fatigue) and CHILLS (he had chills). On 27-Apr-2021, the patient experienced NEPHROSTOMY (nephrostomy bleeding) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and DEHYDRATION (he was dehydrated). On an unknown date, the patient experienced MYALGIA (hurting all over). The patient was hospitalized on 28-Apr-2021 due to NEPHROSTOMY. At the time of the report, NEPHROSTOMY (nephrostomy bleeding), DEHYDRATION (he was dehydrated), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (arm pain), DYSPNOEA (labored breathing), ASTHENIA (very weak), RASH (got rash on both of his forearms), HEADACHE (headaches), MYALGIA (hurting all over), FATIGUE (fatigue) and CHILLS (he had chills) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter. After the patient got the vaccine, he was very fatigue for a few days. He had a lot of arm pain. The doctors noticed that he got rash on both of his forearms. He complained of headaches and it was hurting all over. He was very weak and had chills. He had labored breathing. His nephrostomy was bleeding a lot in the tubes so they had to hospitalize him. He went to hospital on 27-Apr-2021 and was currently in the hospital. He had blood transfusions and he was very dehydrated. He was put on IV saline. He took Eliquis but doctors wanted to stop it because his kidneys were not in good shape.  Company comment: Based on the information provided which indicates patient&#39;s underlying history of nephrostomy, a causal association between the event of nephrostomy bleeding and dehydration and the administration of mRNA-1273 and the events is assessed as unlikely as  the event is common local complication from nephrostomy tube placement,  The other events are temporarily associated with the product use and a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which indicates patient&#39;s underlying history of nephrostomy, a causal association between the event of nephrostomy bleeding and dehydration and the administration of mRNA-1273 and the events is assessed as unlikely as  the event is common local complication from nephrostomy tube placement,  The other events are temporarily associated with the product use and a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I had Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on Wednesday February 3 at 11:30 AM . After the vaccine I went home and had virtually no pain. Around 10PM that night I felt some pain in the toes on my left foot. When I looked, I noticed that my toes were red and appeared slightly swollen.   My big toe was the worst. It was sensitive to the touch and very red. I also felt a short intermittent sharp pain that would last a second or two. It would happen every 3-4 minutes. The next day the redness was gone on all but my big toe.  As I write this today Saturday February 6 at at 11 AM. My big toe is still sore, but does appear a bit better.   I have had gout once in the past. So, gout or Covid ?   The people at were great.

                                                Bell&#39;s Palsy; .A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 79 years-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced Bell&#39;s palsy (facial paralysis).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medication reported included metformin.  On 29 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 012L20A), intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 29 Jan 2021, after the administration of vaccine, the patient developed Bell&#39;s palsy. The patient went to the emergency room (ER) for treatment but was unable to get the condition resolved. The patient was referred to a neurologist, but the side effects were still present up to this point.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the event, Bell&#39;s palsy, was not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Tylenol didn&#39;t help.  Took one tab of Percocet (5-325) to allow me to sleep.    2/19/21 Contacted dentist and was prescribed Penicillin VK 500 mg. Started Penicillin around 3 pm.   2/19/21 ~6 pm onset shakes, chills, sweating, low grade fever (~100.2), nausea, headache, weakness,  difficulty in standing.  Took more tylenol, lay down, fell asleep for approximately 3 hours. Woke briefly took my nighttime meds (atrovastatin, metoprolol, ranolazine, baby aspirin.) Additional information for Item 18:  2/20/21 Felt better when I woke up.  Temp normal. Ate breakfast.  Mild stomach ache. Around 3 pm onset of sweating and chills, shakes. Low grade temp (~100)   2/22/21 Fully recovered.  No lingering issues.  Not sure whether what I experienced is related to the Moderna vaccine or a reaction to the Percocet I took to alleviate the severe pain associated with my toothache.

He fell on the floor and was unable to get up.  His face was very flushed and he broke out in a sweat several times.  We had to have fire dept come and pick him up off the floor.  He was able to get around a little bit with a walker, but spent most of the day in bed and was transported to bathroom by wheelchair.  He was also a bit confused.  He had very little appetite and was unable to eat very much.  At dinner time, he ate a little bit of soup and when he stood up at the table, fell again onto wood floor.  We had to call fire dept to pick him up from floor and EMT&#39;s/ambulance to come out and check him over.  VItals were all normal.  He was just a little bit better on the next several days.  We made an appointment for him to see Dr. on 3/3.  Doctor did blood work which came back normal. Pt. is still not back to normal.

                                                Patient recieved 2nd dose COVID vaccine and had unresponsive episode in car after monitoring period, staff assessed in car and patient had recovered, staff encouraged family to take to ED for evaluation.   From ER MDs note: EKG was normal sinus rhythm, narrow QRS, delayed transition, minimal lateral st depression V4. Patient IV access on arrival, would Brady down to the 40s 1 time as low as 27 but remained alert, blood pressure is not dip.  Troponin was mildly elevated and decision was made to transfer the patient.  Prior to transfer is necessary to rule out pulmonary embolism, intracranial injury Patient wished to proceed with CT angio chest and noncontrast CT of head which were without acute findings.  Patient given aspirin 81 mg to supplement the 81 mg he had earlier today.  Discussed with hospitalist, patient was accepted in transfer. Suspect this is combination of patient&#39;s beta blockade with underlying sinus node dysfunction.  Patient does have prominent lower extremity swelling and suspect pulmonary hypertension despite treatment with CPAP but cannot exclude valvular heart disease.  Patient was went to Hospital.  Symptoms thought to be unlikely from seizure.  Doubt CVA, ongoing cardiac ischemia.

He was initially tachycardic, febrile and had leukocytosis 18K, with admission labs with creatinine 1.8, lactate 2.4. He had need for supplemental oxygen and was placed on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Respiratory viral panel including SARS COV2 PCR was neg. Blood cultures from 2/24, 2/27, 3/3 were negative. CT chest showed some prominent mediastinal adenopathy which was increased from prior CT 2017. Also had axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. 2/27 he had a code blue called for bradycardia in context of receiving ativan for a CT study. Antibiotics  were changed to Vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin, acyclovir on 2/28. Multiple attempts by multiple providers at doing a lumbar puncture have been unsuccessful.  Bronchoscopy 3/2 with left lower lobe secretions. Cultures negative. He has stayed incessantly febrile and working diagnosis is probable underlying lymphoproliferative neoplasm immunostimulated by vaccine. At this time a bone marrow and lymph node excisional biopsy is planned. Patient is unstable to proceed for MRI imaging at this time due to hypotension.

                                                By 3:00 he had a whole body chill.  He was then incoherent, lost all control of all body muscles and was incontinent both bladder and bowel.  He continued as such when Dr. said to give him Prednisone along with the Benadryl he was receiving every six hours starting at 3:30 p.m. 3/8/2021.  He was given a Prednisone at 4:00 p.m. 3/9/2021 and again at 8:00 p.m. on 3/9/2021 along with his Benadryl.  He was unable to ambulate or even turn his body over in bed.  He was able sip water and sports drink but ate nothing since noon on 3/8/2021.  It wasn&#39;t until early Sunday morning that he was able to move his legs and get to a walker and use the toilet.  He slow, very slowly has improved since then.  Late Sunday he was able to get up, and sit in a chair.  Later he was able to take a sit down shower and shampoo and   be an to feel &#34;nearly human&#34; again.  He has slowly progressed since then and Monday morning was able to navigate by himself and to descend and ascend a 13 stair step to the basement.    In discussing the 24 hours he spent in bed he was unaware of any of the things going  on such as not being able to move, but knew he was in pain if he moved his legs.  He also had a temperature of 102.3 which rose to 102.9 and then with cold compress on his forehead and time his fever dropped to 95.4 and the back up to a normal of 97.5.  These are similar symptoms he had after the first injection of the Covid 19 Moderna vaccine and he had had a similar reaction in 2017 from the first flu shot he ever had in his life.  He felt he needed to take this vaccine in order to be able to &#34;have a life&#34; even though we assumed he would have such a bad reaction.  He is slowly improving and if it is like the first injection it will take him nearly two weeks before he can ambulate at the level he was before the vaccination.  Still, he is grateful to Center for being so proactive as to have available the vaccine and it being more convenient for cancer patients than waiting in line at a mass inoculation center.   He would appreciate an acknowledgement that this information has been received and could possibly passed along to help others in his situation.  Thanks.

By 8:00pm I began to feel weak, tired and poorly. By 11:pm I had developed a fever and aches and pains in most joints and muscles which mimicked flu symptons. During the night I became chilled and found it hard to sleep from all of the discomfort. Most of these symptons were almost gone by the next night except for the swelling, which took another 2 days to go down. I have had no other symptons since then.

                                                Patient is an 79 year old male who had his 2nd Moderna vaccination in his dominant right arm Thursday afternoon.  Upon awakening Friday morning, he had difficulty walking.  His legs were strong enough to hold him, but he was unstable.  He also had some numbness on the palmar surfaces of some index and middle fingers of his left hand.  His speech was somewhat garbled, but when his wife would encourage him to repeat himself, he could enunciate more clearly.  He had some nonspecific difficulty swallowing.  He attributed this all to adverse reaction to the vaccination, which would pass...  Friday mid day his wife took him to the barber, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  Later in the day on Friday they went for car ride, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  He had no other episodes of nausea.  He had no fevers or chills.  He had no visual disturbances.  He had no other numbness or paresthesias.  He was aware of no clear weakness.  Finally today, the gait instability persisted and the numbness in the left hand, so he came to the ER for evaluation.   Patient is currently recovering in the hospital

He was on the floor as he slid off the bed and could not push himself up on his arms, and got worse and worse.  He went up to bed, and his son had to come over and help him into bed as he was not even able to lift his legs to get into bed.   Then at 3:00 AM this morning he could start walking again.  Now this morning he is a little wobbly and otherwise getting better.  He did take 2 Tylenol.  No soreness around the injection site, just the extreme weakness.

                                                I had my 2nd Moderna Covid 19 vaccine on Thursday morning March 18, 2021 at  the hospital.  Everything went fine.  At approximately 4.00am Friday morning.  I was awakened and barely made it to the toilet where i vomited 3 times.  Following that took my temperature and it was 102.5.  I was shaking all over, ached all over as well as a headache.  very similar to my 1st vaccine reaction only much worse.  Again i was planning to play golf Friday and Saturday mornings but cancelled.  Can&#39;t play golf when you can barely walk.  I drank pedialyte and gatorade to  rehydrate and basically had no energy to do anything but sleep off and on for the next 2 days.  It wasn&#39;t until Tuesday that I began feeling normal.  Temperature slowly went down and finally was normal Monday night.

After many tests and MRI, they found a mass tumor on his brain, They transferred him to Med Center and they did more testing. On March 13th they preformed surgery to remove the mass tumor. After pathology reports were ran, it came back as a cancerous tumor know as a Glioblastoma or GBM. They were able to remove 80%. The remainder of the tumor was in a part of the brain that they would run the risk of permanent damage or paralysis. He will undergo Chemo and Radiation to treat the 20% left.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included type II diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, heart failure, acid reflux, and urinary retention. Concomitant medications included metformin, gabapentin, furosemide, spironolactone, omeprazole, and tamsulosin.   On 06 Jan 2021, hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the evening of 06 Jan 2021, hours after vaccination, the patient began feeling chills and discomfort. Overnight he began to experience night sweats and did not sleep at all.   During the night on 07 Jan 2021, the patient experienced night sweats and had delirium. When he tried to get out of bed, he collapsed. No treatment information was provided.   On 11 Jan 2021 and 12 Jan 2021, the patient began to feel better. He no longer had night sweats or delirium. He returned to his exercise routine at about 50 percent of what he normally did although he continued to feel weak.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided, although the patient reported he was not sure if he would take the second dose.  The outcome for the events, night sweats and delirium, was considered resolved. The outcome for the events, chills, discomfort, did not sleep at all, and collapsed, was considered resolving. The event, weak, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the events, chills, discomfort, night sweats, did not sleep at all, delirium, collapsed, and weak, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine due to feeling well before the vaccine and feeling more or less disabled after receiving it.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 80-year-old, male subject with medical history of type II diabetes and diabetic neuropathy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of delirium and non-serious unexpected event of asthenia, discomfort, insomnia, fall, and night sweats, and non-serious expected event of chills. The event of discomfort, insomnia, chills and night sweats occurred 1 day; the event of delirium, and fall occurred 2 days and asthenia occurred 6 days after mRNA-1273 administration.  The subject was on metformin for diabetes ty II and gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy, Lasix and spironolactone for heart failure, omeprazole for acid reflux and Flomax for urinary retention. Treatment details not provided. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Right after the injection had warmth around injection site.  Around 12:00 on 1/27/21, he looked wilted.  Wife checked his temp and it was 103.8.    Was given Tylenol and temp went up to 104.  She called the doctor at 2:00 PM, told her to see the doctor.  Lethargy and weakness.  Tested him for COVID and flu and still had fever.  Was negative for both, told to alternate Tylenol and Ibuprofen, went down to 102.  At 6:30 PM went up to 103.8, at that point she called the doctor, could not speak to him until 6:45 PM instructed to bath down with warm rag, and was told it was probably a reaction to the vaccine.  Was called in a steroid pack.  He went to bed running about 103.6 at 8:30 PM.  Was able to get up, was given more Tylenol/Ibuprofen and his fever finally broke around 101 about 4:00 AM.  Got up this morning and does feel better.  Running around 100-101 temp.  The vaccine is the only thing that has been different in his normal routine.  Still has warmth to the injection site, red.

                                                Client developed a mild covid infection 12/8/21 and recovered. He was admitted 12/25 with hypogycemia and mild weakness and sent home He was given his first dose of the Moderna vaccine 1/4/21 at approximately 9AM covid vaccine clinic He developed weakness the next day  (1/5) prompting admission to a hospital and then transition to subacute rehabilitation briefly  Work up at hospital revealed progressive respiratory failure and pneumonia requiring intubation and progressive ascending weakness and sensory loss without upper motor neuron changes.  MRI : nerve root enhancement LP : protein 40, &#43;/- 80 lymphocytes, cultures negative B 12 and B6 normal extensive CSF testing still pending campylobacter and Musk antibodies negative Neurology diagnosed likely AIDP (Guillain-Barre) and an EMG is planned for the near future.  Neurology felt the cause of his GBS was likely his covid infection verses his Moderna vaccination He was treated with plasmapheresis.  Client received dexamethasone, remdesivir, and zosyn and doxycycline when progressive leukocytosis and procalcitonin elevation was noted. Candida was cultured from tracheal aspirates but felt most likely d/t colonization with an option to treat further if he did not continue to improve. He is now extubated, unable to swallow and has profound weakness and distal sensory loss. He will transition to Acute rehab in the near future.  Comorbidities:as described in the above section and... DM2, CKD3, HTN, DJD, BPH ( h/o prostate surgery), h/o Lumbar surgery and hernia repair, GERD, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia.  Possible etiologies of his AIDP ( GBS)  would include his recent covid infection, the Moderna Vaccine, or other undiagnosed infection. He got his flu shot 9/25 ( fluzone sanofi) so this is not likely to be the culprit

I gave him Tylenol and water He perked up that evening. People say the second dose is worse and I am concerned about him having a worse reaction. He was in the hospital with COVID 19  last August and September and was very ill.  He came home in a wheel chair and oxygen 24/7. He is walking with a cane now and only uses oxygen at night.  I am wondering what you think about him getting the second dose of Moderna. .?.?  Please let me know what your expert opinion is. Thank you very much.

                                                Pt here with concerns of numbness and tingling of his body since his COVID vaccine. He had it on 2/3 in his R deltoid. He notes started to feel bad on 2/6. He went to urgent care and was told that he probably had TIA. He came into clinic that next week and I ordered an MRI of his brain.  MRI brain showed senescent changes and mastoid congestion, but no evidence of stroke/acute event.        His symptoms started with R hand numbness (R thumb and R index finger), then progressed to R leg and arm numbness, R facial numbness with trouble speaking, which he describes as feeling like he had a lidocaine shot at the dentist. He denies any acute illness at that time, but did sleep alot more.         Currently the only symptom he has left is R index and thumb numbness as well as feeling like the R side of his face feels different than the L.

Patient received his vaccine at 2:08pm intramuscularly in his left arm. Patient was asked to remain in the waiting area to be observed. At around 2:34pm, patient started feeling light headed and started yawning. Patient&#39;s wife noticed the yawning and said that he does that before experiencing a seizure. After a couple minutes of slow steady breathing, patient started having a seizure and his eyes started rolling back. Patients pulse was steady at the time and soon came out of the seizure. About 45 seconds-1 minute later he started experiencing a second similar seizure that lasted roughly 15 seconds. EMS was called and they came to help him. Patient experienced 1 more quick seizure in the time it took the EMT to get to the store. Patient started having a stronger pulse, breathing better, and looked a lot better. Patient also is a diabetic at the time and his blood sugar was slightly low. EMT assisted patient the rest of the way and they patient and wife left the store to go home.

                                                Acute pancreatitis; Acute renal failure; Low blood pressure; Weakness; Decreased appetite; Fatigue; Alanine aminotransferase increased; Aspartate aminotransferase increased; Troponin increased; Lipase increased; Blood bilirubin increased; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning an 81-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed an odd presentation of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue.  The patient&#39;s medical history included advanced dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism and possible leukemia. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 08 Jan 2021, three days after vaccination, the patient developed symptoms of weakness, decreased appetite, and fatigue.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was admitted into the hospital with a diagnosis of low blood pressure,acute renal failure,acute pancreatitis,alanine aminotransferase increased,aspartate aminotransferase increased, troponin increased,lipase increased and blood bilirubin increased. Abnormal lab results included &#34;significantly elevated&#34; aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, lipase up to 1900, and &#34;slightly elevated&#34; troponin of 0.079.  On 13 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had improved, and he was discharged. Treatment for the event included two liters of intravenous fluid and supportive care.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.    The events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, were considered resolved on 13 Jan 2021.   The physician assessed the events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, as not related to mRNA-1273. The physician&#39;s rationale was that the patient may have had a gallstone obstructing the pancreatic duct and once the stone passed, the patient got better with supportive care and slow administration of fluids.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 81-year-old male patient with medical history of dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism, and possible leukemia, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, the non-serious listed event of fatigue, and the non-serious unlisted events of weakness, decreased appetite, elevated aspartate transaminase, elevated alanine transaminase, elevated bilirubin, elevated lipase, and elevated troponin.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on the current available information and in agreement with the physician reporter&#39;s assessment, the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273, noting the rapid improvement after administration of IV fluids.

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental. Patient had echocardiogram without right to left shunt or clot identified, no known history of atrial fibrillation. Was monitored on telemetry for the duration of his hospitalization without any noted arrhythmias, discharged on e patch for 14-day outpatient monitoring.

Starting the day after that, the patient&#39;s wife reported that the patient began to display confusion, weakness, and fatigue. The patient also presented to the clinic on 4/2/2021 with complaint of &#34;sinus pressure&#34; and was prescribed an antibiotic. He progressively worsened to the point where he was only able to speak a few words, and presented to hospital on 4/7/2021. Given extremely low platelet count on presentation, a diagnostic workup for TTP vs. ITP was commenced. It was determined by the inpatient hematology/oncology service that the patient was likely experiencing alterations in mental status and weakness and thrombocytopenia due to TTP.  Fresh frozen plasma was administered. Plasma exchange daily x 5 days and corticosteroids were initiated.

                                                My dad got the Moderna Vaccine on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 in his left arm at the Mall injection site for the Health Department. He was told that the side effects could mean his arm hurting, tiredness, headache, and even a low grade fever. Additionally, the site informed us both (as I was with him to get the injection) that this was all normal and not to seek medical attention unless these symptoms last longer than 72 hours. That evening, my dad was experiencing all of those symptoms, and went to bed at 7pm. A little after 10am on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, when he awoke, my dad went to the bathroom vomiting. This was where he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Fire/Rescue was dispatched about 10:30am after my mom started CPR. County Fire Rescue EMTs and Paramedics continued CPR and other attempts at reviving him all the way to Hospital Emergency Department. He was pronounced dead at 12:14pm on Wednesday, January 13, 2021. We have no doubt my dad, following the instructions of the injection facility, thought he was just experiencing the side effects of the vaccine. He had no chance. Had this injection been done in the RIGHT arm, perhaps he could have recognized the arm numbness being that of an impending heart attack. We really miss Dad. He served this country with distinction for over 50 years, and we believe his country failed him.

He has very thin skin and suffered several skin tears.  We applied pressure and bandaged wounds and observed pt for 30 minutes.  He did not hit his head.  Followed up with pt&#39;s wife next day and she reported that his arm was sore, but no other complaints.  I recommended they see a Dr. for his skin tears.

Went to ED - &#34;Patient is an 82yo male with a history of chronic Afib on Eliquis, HTN, and bradykinesia (thought to be PD) who presented to the ED with a CC of weakness after receiving 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine. He also had low-grade fever and difficulties ambulating. In the ED he was febrile at 38.5C and HR 159bpm. EKG revealed Afib RVR. BP was stable. He was given Cardizem 10mg IV x1. Basic labs were unremarkable. COVID negative. CXR negative. He was given Tylenol for fever and admitted under observation. He remained afebrile and heart rate remained controlled with home Cardizem dosing. Cardiology was consulted who will refer him to their clinic to establish routine care with their service. PT/OT recommended home with home PT/OT. The patient overall felt much improved compared to admission and felt ready for discharge. He was discharged home in stable condition.

Liquid oxycodone given and did not help much either.  Nebulizer given x 2.  More oxycodone given and after 1 hour was able breath easier but still struggled all night.  Refused to go to hospital due to not wanting to die in hospital.  Nebulizer given again at 3 am.  Arm and legs jerking really hard.  Boost given.  4 am fell asleep.  6 am did another nebulizer tx.  Oxycodone given.  Still struggling with breathing and albuterol.  Continued this  the next 10 days.  Slept in recliner every night.  SOB with activity and eating.  Went back and forth with walker to bathroom and did not have to use a walker prior.  Arm was very red and had a rash.  Also had a bad headach.  Called doctor and said to go to ER but refused due to not wanting to die in hospital.  28 days later is using Nebulizer 3 times a day instead of 6.  Now just started not using walker.  Was shoveling snow prior to shot.

                                                The night of the vaccine at 9:00 PM his right arm was totally numb.  He got up and took magnesium maleate, and it started clearing up the numbness, and took a baby aspirin.  His right eye went blurry as if he had a cataract in that eye.  Part of the eye was different, crescent vision.  He then took some vitamins for eye, and took an Astroxanthem and started to have some benefit.  He then took Epicor and it cleared up.  A couple of days later he then had some blurry vision again and took some more vitamins, and it cleared up.  He did get some dry eye drops and is using them.    All the symptoms have resolved now.   He does have an appointment with his eye doctor next month.  Has not seen a regular MD or PCP in over 10 years.

Client was ushered up into the bleacher seating at the vaccination site following the dose administration, and upon sitting down was experiencing shortness of breath (reported by the client to be from walking up the stairs). Client pulled out personal inhaler (albuterol) and self-administered a dose. Responder noted pallor and increased difficulty with speaking for the client, but client&#39;s breathing returned to a regular rate and rhythm in the minutes following albuterol administration. Client&#39;s pallor resolved. The client refused emergency medical services twice, and refused having his vitals taken. The client was monitored visually by responder until deemed appropriate for discharge from the observation area. When the client ambulated down the stairs, Responder noted unsteadiness in gait. Once the client was safely at the bottom of the stairs, a wheelchair was retrieved for the client so that the client could safely exit the facility. Client accepted the wheelchair at this time. Client refused a vitals check a second time at the checkout station, per responder.

I had no appetite when I woke up at 6am, took my morning meds and went back to bed. Noon I felt a little better and it gradually went away and it seem to gradually go away. Because I have an auto-immune disease I seem to have had a reaction to the vaccine because it did not bother my wife, except for her being a little tired.

I went to his room,I told the staff to call 911. He had started eating his lunch and felt that the food was stuck at the notch at the bottom of his neck. I prepared to give the EpiPen. He stopped coughing and said he was feeling better, but the staff member . said he didn&#39;t sound right. I decided not to give the EpiPen.  The Depot Runner asked to see his throat and tongue and agreed that he didn&#39;t need the EpiPen. Several other staff members came.  Asked a staff member to take his vitals. EMS arrived and took him to the ER.

Ibuprofen administered.  A pronounced feeling of weakness and lassitude throughout the morning, with slow recovery until mid-evening.  Now at February 10th, return to normal feeling and strength.

He got up and got dressed, went about his day.  Around 12:30 his nephew saw him and commented that his left eye was puffy and red, his face was swollen and drooped and he looked like he was having an allergic reaction of some kind.  At that time, his speech became slurred.  They got a neighbor, who is a nurse, to come over. She recommended medical attention.  They went to an urgent care center and were immediately sent to the hospital.. Left side of his face was drooping and his speech was slurred.  There were no cognitive issues.  Arrived at hospital around 1:30. He was assessed immediately for a stroke and it was determined that he had not had a stroke.  Bell&#39;s Palsy was diagnosed.  He was given a steroid injection at the hospital and given a Medrol dosepak to begin on Saturday, Feb. 20 and sent home.   As of today, Monday, February 22, his symptoms are improving.

                                                Daughter calling to ask about side effects of COVID vaccine? She said her 83 yr old dad got the COVID- 19 yesterday and overnight he became confused, had severe weakness, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, and became feverish.  She said mom said they both got first dose of COVID vaccine yesterday around noon- then last night he started to feel unwell. Around 2am- her mom said her dad- became very weak, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, confused, started coughing, he had chills, felt feverish. She said so concerning by 4am her mom called EMS who came and took him to the Medical Center.   She said he had pretty severe case of COVID in December that he need hospitalized for-she said  he as really weak, foggy headed at that time, kind of out of his mind- she said was told that is how he was acting last night.   After being seen in ED and getting put on some fluids and then antibiotics he now seems to be acting more like himself. They hydrated- have some concerns about possible pneumonia dx so they started him on antibiotics- was told this might be due to his rxn post &#43; COVID vaccine - which is what prompted her to call today.   He is supposed to follow up with his PCP doctor.  He seemed better when he got home this morning- she said just left him a little bit ago after eating early lunch with him. She is not sure if getting him hydrated &amp; sent home with antibiotics is what helped or just time since now about 24 hours post vaccination dose.  Confirmed he has had no prior rxn to any other vaccines in the past.

My doctor looked at it and prescribed Z-pac antibiotic as he thought it might be infected. While the symptoms subsided a bit, they did not go away until after the antibiotic was used up. Since then I have had much loss of strength in both arms while trying to use them reaching above my head. I have to push my left arm up with my right hand to get dishes off the second shelf in the cupboard. The doctor then took blood samples and did a urine analysis but found nothing. He sent me to the ER to have a CT scan of the abdomin and IV fluids. While there they took more blood samples and found nothing. I am also having lower back pains

                                                On day of Wednesday day of Moderna vaccine shot, felt good all day, got ready for bed at 9 PM.  Felt very warm and took my temperature it was 99.7.  Not too bad.  My hands and feet were very cold.  Put socks on my feet and climbed in bed.  Feeling ok.  Woke up around 4 AM my tee shirt is soaking wet, had to pee.  Got out of bed and walked to bathroom no problem.  Sat down and then my wife said she heard a loud noise in bathroom.  She comes to check on me and I?m sitting on toilet passed out, I?m leaning to my right against the shower door.  She?s hollering and talks to me to wake up and shakes me and eventually I wake up, get up and walk to the bed no problem.  Then I feel the urge to vomit.  Go through a series of dry heaves, lay on my back and feel urge to vomit again.  Wife tells me to lay on my side, not on my back, that works and I fall asleep.  Woke up Thursday at 8 AM, wife is in the kitchen, I make the bed get dressed and feel ok.  Walk out to the kitchen and wife is amazed I?m OK.  She proceeds to tell me about my passing out in the bath room.  I have no recollection that occurred.  Had some tea and toast, drinking water to rehydrate and felt better.  Walked outside, got leaves out of the pool.  Feeling better.  No further reaction, just a little tired the rest of the day.  Had light lunch, soup.  Took a nap at 3 PM woke refreshed and had normal dinner with a glass of wine.   Today Friday had normal breakfast and feel completely normal.  All in all not a bad reaction.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 031620A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient experienced little bruising in the arm. On 12 Feb 2021, the patient was a bit off. On Sunday, 28 Feb 2021, in the evening, the patient got cold, and within minutes his entire whole body was in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe were in pain. It felt like it was invaded with COVID. He went to hospital and got tested for COVID, Strep throat and Flu, and all three test results were negative. On an unknown date, the patient experienced tightening in his throat muscle and he went to the hospital where he was admitted.  While there, they did every possible test, chest MRI, Neck MRI, all possible viral tests, and rapid and full COVID test.  The rapid and full COVID tests came back negative.  Results for chest MRI, neck MRI and viral tests were not provided.  The hospital also performed a blood culture for bacteria. Results were not provided.  The patient was unable to move much, his blood pressure and oxygen were a little unstable.

By the next evening, he started vomiting violently, trembling and sweating. He lived in country and his caregiver didn&#39;t think to take him to the hospital. The symptoms calmed down after a while, but he was not able to hold any food or liquids down. Eventually, he fell asleep and his caregiver left for the night. He returned on Easter Sunday at 9:30 am and found my uncle deceased.

                                                COVID-19 pneumonia; Weakness; This spontaneous case was reported by a patient family member or friend (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of COVID-19 PNEUMONIA (COVID-19 pneumonia) and ASTHENIA (Weakness) in an 83-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 002A21A and 030L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Artificial cardiac pacemaker user and COVID-19 on 01-Feb-2021. Concurrent medical conditions included Chronic kidney disease (20 years).   On 22-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 01-Feb-2021, the patient experienced COVID-19 PNEUMONIA (COVID-19 pneumonia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant) and ASTHENIA (Weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged). The patient was hospitalized from 05-Feb-2021 to 15-Feb-2021 due to ASTHENIA and COVID-19 PNEUMONIA. At the time of the report, COVID-19 PNEUMONIA (COVID-19 pneumonia) and ASTHENIA (Weakness) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 01-Feb-2021, COVID-19: positive (Positive) positive. On 01-Feb-2021, Oxygen consumption: low (Low) low.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications were provided. Treatment information provided mentioned that patient was prescribed vitamin C, vitamin D zinc and steroid. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Healthcare professional was consulted on 05 Feb 2021.   Patient was admitted on 05 Feb 2021 and discharged on 15 Feb2021.  Patient received Nursing House rehab which included oxygen, steps and walking.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these event (asthenia), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Based on the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273, the event (Covid-19 pneumonia) is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Further information has been requested.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-037770 (E2B Linked Report).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these event (asthenia), a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Had full tx done and brought to ER. Reports still feels weak after dialysis.    84 year old male comes in today after completing dialysis for evaluation of generalized weakness x 5 days. He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.

In addition, my chest was wheezing and felt as if &#34;bubbles&#34; were in my chest. My arm felt very hot and tender at the injection site. This attack lasted for half an hour. I went back to sleep and awoke the following morning feeling very weak and confused. Feeling extremely fatigued, all I wanted to do was sleep. I also lost my appetite. The next day, I had occasional coughing which subsided with my over the counter cough medicine.

On the drive to the appointment, he felt the urge to urinate and urinated in a urinal he had with him.  The urine looked like blood with clots.  Patient admits that he has had some clots in his urine for past week, so he had taken plavix to break up the clots (plavix is not his medication).  Given weakness, difficulty urinating, and gross hematuria, patient was sent to the ER.  ER nurse was called and given report

                                                Mini seizure; Diarrhea; Slight temperature; Vomiting; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning an 84-year-old male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced events of slight temperature/fever, vomiting, diarrhea and short seizure early in the morning.  The patient&#39;s medical history include type 1 diabetic, history of mini seizures and had a pacemaker installed a week ago-did have check up after and was good. Concomitant medications reported were levetiracetam  - anti seizure, Insulin 2 times per day taking for type 1 diabetes.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 029120A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  He was fine after taking vaccine, but on 28 Jan 2021 started developing symptoms.  On 28 Jan 2021, the patient experienced the events of slight temperature, vomiting and diarrhea. On the same day, patient experienced the event of mini seizers for about 5 min in early morning and took levetiracetam. No other treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s history of seizure was a strong confounder of the event of short seizure early in the morning.

En route while in ambulance, he experienced a convulsion with rhythmic shaking in all limbs lasting several seconds.  He had a second episode requiring midazolam and levetiracetam. On arrival to MGH ED, the patient was afebrile, heart rate 133, blood pressure 173/93, oxygen saturation 99% on a nonrebreather.  He was found to be severely encephalopathic, mute, and not answering questions or following commands.  He was admitted to the neuroICU and intubated for airway protection given his poor mental status. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric treatment of meningoencephalitis, but these were discontinued after his CSF was not concerning for a bacterial infection herpes simplex encephalitis.  Antibiotics were discontinued. He was extubated on hospital day 2.  After extubation he had persistent mixed receptive-expressive aphasia that was slowly improving over time. At discharge from the hospital, he was able to occasionally say a simple sentence, could repeat simple phrases, and could follow simple commands. He was discharged to Rehab

                                                Initially, the night of January 18, the left arm was somewhat sore as expected. The next day, within about 24 hours after the injection, I felt slightly queasy, somewhat weak, what we called on the farm, being &#34;off our feed.&#34; The left arm was increasingly painful, although I slept reasonably well that night. On the second day after the injection (Wednesday, January 20), the left arm was even more painful, I was actually nauseous, weak,  and in the afternoon had a temperature of 99.8 (my normal temperature is 97.4). I had some abdominal pain for a few weeks before the injection and that pain had increased. But by bed time (about 10:30 p.m. CST) the temperature had returned near normal and I was feeling much better. Today, Thursday, January 21, I felt normal, no general weakness and minimal abdominal pain, and there was only very slight soreness in the left arm. My wife (81 years old with a history of nut allergies and asthma) received an injection at the same time I did and had minimal side effects from the Moderna vaccine with the same Lot Number. I note the EUA Fact Sheet says the Modern vaccine is still being studied so I hope is a small contribution.

                                                Patient presents today with his wife and son. He was recently hospitalized having developed a fever the day after his Covid vaccine 1 with associated confusion and some ataxia. He was admitted to the hospital overnight where an MRI scan suggested no acute change showing only moderate cerebral atrophy and some small vessel occlusive changes. He tested positive for Covid by PCR in the emergency department on 1/22. His oxygen saturation was stable. He did have a fever and describes falling off the toilet because of some generalized leg weakness and uncoordination. He has had some chronic left greater than right upper extremity sensory loss following prior cervical spine stenosis requiring urgent surgery in 3/2019. He has had some chronic left foot drop as well. He reports being somewhat deconditioned having spent some time in bed to the above episode but is now ambulating with a cane at home and has occupational and physical therapy in place. He has been mildly dyspneic on exertion above baseline but attributes this to some deconditioning. He did have an episode of lower dental pain with ambulation in the office that was more than usual though denies associated chest pain or pressure and has had no jaw or shoulder pain with exertion. Review of systems is negative for headache.

                                                On the evening of 3/05 I experienced a sore arm and a slight temperature (98.8--about 1&#43;degree from my normal).  The next morning I began a bike ride and within a few blocks was having sore arms and extreme fatigue.  I went home, took my BP and it was 101/59.  On 3/07 I used a stationary bike at the gym, came home very fatigued and BP was 92/63.  On 3/08 it was 111/61 after I spent 2 hrs or so flying airplanes, my other hobby.  Today I tried a bike ride again, quickly got shoulder, arm and back pain and extreme fatigue--came home and BP was 90/59.  I ate lunch, drank a Coke for caffeine, tried to ride again and it was 104/61 after a short ride.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 09 Jan 2021, approximately 10 hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot 012L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient woke up at 10:00 pm with severe left hip pain. His left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), and he took 2 ibuprofens then went to bed.   On 10 Jan 2021, he was still in pain with a low grade fever of 98.8 which is 1 to 2 degrees higher than normal for him. He reported using his wife&#39;s walker to ambulate and took 4 ibuprofens which helped his hip.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was still in pain, had a limp, and ran a low fever until the afternoon. Treatment for the events included ibuprofen.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the event, low grade fever, was considered resolved on 11 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), low grade fever and limp, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events of low grade fever, gait disturbance and severe left hip pain are temporally associated with the administration of mRNA-1273 and a causal association cannot be excluded. Fever and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the product.  The event of paralysis is considered unlikely pending additional information.

                                                after receiving his initial dose the next day he seemed to have suffered a TIA that took almost a week for him to recovery from. He was confused, no appetite, weak, and generally not himself.  Prior to receiving his second dose he was alert, eating, no complaints of any discomfort or issues. The next day following his second dose he passed away from what we think was a massive heart attack.   As a family we feel his weakened state contributed to this and not the fault of the vaccine but felt it important to notify you in case individuals such as patient should be monitored in a different way or use a different vaccine.

The patient&#39;s significant other reported neither of them were feeling well on 2/21/2021.  Approximately 28 hours after vaccination, the patient was found unresponsive in the bathtub.  EMS arrived within 5 minutes, resuscitation attempt was unsuccessful, CPR terminated at 1503 and the patient pronounced dead.  The Medical examiner refused the case on the basis of lack of jurisdiction, and the remains were moved to a local funeral home.  No autopsy was performed.  This event is not thought to be related to the vaccination event or the vaccine, the death is thought to be from natural causes.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not included. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 27 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 06 Feb 2021, approximately 10 days after the patient received the vaccine, he experienced a fast heart rate, dizziness, cold body temperature, and atrial fibrillation. (The wife reports that they purchased an EKG machine, and this is what the machine showed them. Unaware if he had this before the vaccine or not.)  Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 was unknown.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cold body temperature, dizziness and atrial fibrillation, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, the event occurred 9 days after vaccine administration and very limited information regarding this patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were event is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.  Further information has been requested.

By 3/10/21, patient was more alert.   Patient remained fairly consistent from that time with poor appetite, dehydration issue, weakness and dysphagia management.  Then on 3/27/21 he became disoriented, wheezing, labored breathing,   Vitals were 92% oxygen on room air, Temp 97.5, 158/62, pulse 94.  Oxygen started and sent to ER.  Family reported patient is admitted to hospital with mild stroke and UTI.   The vaccine seemed to change patient&#39;s state of health about 2 weeks post first dose with multiple sequelae.  This seems similar to timing of actual COVID infection pattern when it is the actual virus.

Pain was slightly relieved by burping and passing wind. After 3 hours of these symptoms I Called EMS, who checked and could find no other cause other than reaction to the injection. I took pepcid, gas pills and additional blood pressure pill but had no relief. After EMS visit I took Tylenol and was up for hours before finally falling asleep.

We had to have help from a man and a women to help get him on the toilet, off the toilet, to sit him up on the couch, getting in and out of bed. He could not function on his own. It effected him mentally. Right now he couldn&#39;t even that this happened. On the 15th he seemed normal. But now like a week later his memory and strength was bad. Today he is not that bad. It seems to be coming and going with the problem mentally. I took him to the doctor today.

                                                He had the vaccine, everything was fine until he got up around 12:30 AM.  He was shaking really, really bad with tremors.  His wife got up and he had urinated on himself, and his wife felt his forehead and he did not feel hot.  Went back to bed, he went to sleep and the next morning 2/13/21, wife got up and when he got up around 7:30 he was dressed, but not buttoned right and had his hat on and was confused.  He sat in front of the fireplace not moving, and starting talking nonsense until 9:00 - 9:30 when he started talking to her.  He could not differentiate between morning and night, and then slowly progressed back to normal.  Did not eat much, and said that he could eat anymore.  He was pacing back and forth and then finally cleared mentally and was ok around 10:00 AM.   He is now back to his normal self today 2/16/21.   She gave him 250 mg of Tylenol around 9:30 AM on 2/13/21 as his temp was 100.1.  HIs blood pressure at that time was 103/59 and pulse 100.   She then checked it in the other arm and it was 104/60, pulse 99.  She then checked it again on Monday and it was 108/61 with 68 pulse rate which is normal for him.

                                                I came home and found my father on the floor in his bedroom just after 8am.  He was disoriented and unable to get up.  I had to lift him up and he was still off balanced.  I asked him if he had fallen and how long he was on the floor.  He couldn&#39;t give me a clear answer and I don&#39;t know how long he was on the floor.  I noticed he seemed very weak and I asked him when was the last time he had something to eat and he wasn&#39;t sure.  He said maybe 1 or 2 days.  I asked if he didn&#39;t have an appetite and he couldn&#39;t answer me or give me a reason.

Didn&#39;t eat all day.  This morning,  March 7, he said he felt better and slept well.  I fixed him a bowl of oatmeal.  He took one bite and said he couldn&#39;t eat anymore.  All of a sudden he appeared to fall into a state of unconsciousness and could not respond to anything I said.  I tried to shake him with no results so I decided to call 911 and when they got here he came around a little and said he didn&#39;t want  to go to the hospital.  Still not eating and just wants to sleep.  He is 88 years old.  I am the same age and had no adverse event (yet).

Daughter was home with pt and after he went to the bathroom she reports pt was out of breath, however that has been chronic/ongoing for him due to his diagnosis of COPD, pulmonary HTN and metastatic lung cancer. After sitting and resting in a chair, she states patient became unresponsive. She called 911 who told her he had no pulse and was not breathing. She states that they were not able to resuscitate him. Pt had been suspected to be positive for COVID as he had symptoms of increased cough, congestion and rhinitis. Daughter (that is primary caregiver and lives in home with patient) tested positive for COVID on 1/31/21. She started having symptoms on 1/25/21. Patient started having symptoms on 1/31/21. No COVID test confirmed prior to pt&#39;s death. Patient had a definitive diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma in October 2020. History of multimorbidity. He did have a 60 pack year history of smoking. Most likely cause of death from available records is metastatic lung cancer, with other serious diagnoses contributing.
