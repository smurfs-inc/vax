                                                Patient received Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/30/2020 at a Pharmacy clinic where he was a resident. Nurses at the facility reported that he was responsive and showed no signs of any adverse effects until 1/2/2021 when he was observed slightly unresponsive and staring at the ceiling and trembling. He had a fever of 101F at this time. The facility ordered labs and a rapid COVID test (all of which came back normal) and started IV antibiotics. A few hours later, patient began bleeding from his eyes, nose, and mouth and was sent to the local ER. The patient refused being admitted to the ICU for possible sepsis/hemorrhage and died the following day on 1/3/2021. All healthcare professionals involved agreed that this was not likely due to the vaccine, but needed to be reported nonetheless.

                                                I woke in the night on Monday, Feb. 1 to use the bathroom and when I stepped out of bed I felt a sharp pain in the outside ball of my right foot. I thought I had stepped on a needle. I could not step on that side of the foot as I walked without sharp pain. I immediately searched for what might be in my foot and found  nothing.  The pain continued through the night and into the morning.  My shot was in the left shoulder. I have concluded this is a neurological reaction (nerve pain) from the vaccine (Moderna). Never had this pain before.

                                                Patient had the Moderna vaccine 1st dose roughly 5 days ago. Overnight, his wife woke to him  having an episode of what appeared to be a tonic clonic seizure around 5 am on 2/23/21, followed by a period of disorientation and unresponsiveness consistent with a post ictal state. The patient has no history of seizures. It is unclear if this had anything to do with the Moderna vaccine,  but I am reporting it due to the timing of the episode in conjunction with the vaccine.

                                                Arm was sore starting approximately 4 hours. after the shot. I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

But then a fever, chills and aches the day after vaccine. Two days after, still febrile and feeling worse and experiencing shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Fatigue, fever and lightheadedness continue for three more days. On the 6th day post-vaccine, taken to ER and admitted to hospital with a pneumonia and blood counts dangerously low. Received 3 blood transfusions and is receiving 2 different IV antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Still in hospital and waiting to see how blood counts go. I can?t say the vaccine CAUSED this, but it all happened rapidly, immediately following the vaccine.

He was hospitalized for one night and the staff had a difficult time waking him up.   The patient&#39;s medical history included prostate cancer last year. Patient provided that he takes 8 or 10 different medications daily but did not list them out. No other medical history was shared and patient has no known drug or food allergies.   On 30-Jan-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received one of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 042L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 31-Jan-2021, the day after the mRNA-1273 vaccine was given, the patient had a seizure and was hospitalized for one night. He stated that the hospital staff had a hard time waking him up. He spent one night in the hospital and was released on 01-Feb-2021. It was not reported what caused the seizure and the patient was unsure if the hospital knew that he had the vaccination the day prior. He was discharged with Keppra.  Consent to contact was given by the patient to contact him and the hospital.  No further treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not reported.  The events, seizure and depressed consciousness level, were considered resolved on 01 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events have been provided at this time. Further information has been requested.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included chronic cough, acid reflux, minor allergies, hypercholesterolemia and a penicillin allergy.  Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient acquired a Stevens-Johnson like syndrome which required a three day inpatient stay and the consultation of Infectious Disease and Dermatologic consultants. Per his SCORTEN score, he had roughly a 3% chance of mortality from the event. He was closely monitored for signs of decompensation but did not have excessive desquamation or duskiness after treatment was initiated. With IV steroids and IV rehydration, the patient improved over the hospitalization course and labs were essentially back to normal a week later on follow up.

He started to suddenly have seizures and was not responsive.  When I arrived on Feb 21 he didn&#39;t say much and had seizures that night.  On Feb 22, he responded a little bit and had a big black eye from a seizure the night before.  On Feb 22 he had at least 4 seizures and he passed that afternoon around 1:20 pm

                                                He had the injection, had the sore arm and approximately 3 hours after the vaccination he began to experience severe chest pain across his entire chest and into his jaw, which was exacerbated upon taking a deep breath.  He called his cardiologist who advised him to go to the ER.  He was worked up, subsequently admitted from 2/8/21 to 2/11/21, a lot was ruled out but no specific diagnosis made at that time.  They did note some pleural effusion and pericardial effusion at that time.  Upon discharge on 2/11/21, starting Thursday evening he continued to have pain in the chest, but not as severe as when he entered into the hospital.  Every evening including last night has began with severe night sweats, low grade fever and the chest pains have continued.  Went to see his PCP,  Cardiologist and his Electrophysiologist several days later the following after discharge, he does have a pacemaker, and was told by all three of them that he has pericarditis and that the reaction could have been related to the vaccination.  It seemed more than coincidental that the symptoms did not appear until 3 hours after the vaccine.  Was put on Colchicine to treat the pericarditis and then received a 2nd opinion and has reinstituted the colchicine.  His low grade fever has finally dissipated.  During the day he feels okay, but still continues with the chest pains and the night sweats.  His hemoglobin dropped in the hospital possibly related to the heparin and then put on Eliquis postop, and now discontinued, and received an iron infusion to boost his hemoglobin.  He is scheduled for another iron infusion this Wednesday.    He  went to see GI physician and feels that he may have a bleed due to the infusion.   He has had an anastomosis due to Crohn&#39;s disease and feels that&#39;s where the bleed may have been coming from as he did have an ulceration at last colonoscopy.  He did have atrial flutter due this and was advised to have an ablation, and trying to reduce the pericarditis and FU later with other heart related problems.

                                                Patient awoke the morning of March 5th feeling weak, fatigued, and unsteady. He went to his primary care provider 5 days later on the 10th of March, as his symptoms were not improving. He told his PCP there that the past few days he was suffering from unsteady gait, walking around like hes &#34;drunk&#34;, and bouncing off walls. It was thought his symptoms were caused by a low serum potassium value, so he was given a rx for potassium. 3 days later the patient presented to the emergency room where his problems persisted. He was still having trouble keeping balance when he walked around. One of the providers treating him reached out to neurology, who recommended that the patient be started on high dose steroids followed by a prednisone taper for tranverse myelitis, The patient was then admitted and treated at Hospital.

By the afternoon, he was so weak he could not lift himself out of the chair. Even with the help of another person, he was too weak to stand. I called for emergency help. He had a fever of 101, was vomiting, very disorientated, confused, could not understand what people were saying to him.

                                                At this point I am going to give you an account of my past 14 months health and how I know it is related to the covid virus.   i am sure i have had long covid  from december 2019 or january 2020 to the present based on symptoms i incurred on these dates. On my first night I ended up vomiting my guts out at 2:00 in the am. The following 2 weeks I had constant diarrhea.  At the end of those 2 weeks,  i ended up in emergency room. And this all happening when  i haven&#39;t&#39; vomited in over 30 years.  vital signs and blood work were good at the hospital and the drs were confused as to why i felt so bad. i returned home the next day where our permanent home is,  and 3 months later the covid thing surfaced. at first being thought of as a respiratory disease. then in the past months it is surfacing that it may now be considered a gastrointestinal disease that progresses to a respiratory disease. after checking the five main symptoms of long covid i discovered that i have at least 3 of the 5  common symptoms for this. Those being extreme fatigue, joint pain, and cough. In addition to the long covid symptoms, I have encountered tasting issues on and off again.  I have had many discussions with my primary care doctor, and no results or conclusive information came from my inquiries. Then on feb 12, 2021 I got my first moderna shot. About 2-3 weeks later I encountered a sharp pain in a muscle in my neck left side. Shortly thereafter I got very light headed. Then another  week later while  driving a motor home, I encountered a frightening experience with my eyes, and the neck pain and soreness was still there. My vision was very blurred and I was seeing double vision at different angles. I ended up at the medical center and was admitted for 4 days. Before I was admitted, I saw a local ophthalmologist here and he diagnosed me with a condition known as ?edema in optic nerve, inferior, consistent with optic nephropathy?. The symptom I had to get me to the doctor was I was losing eyesight in my left eye. After hd steroid treatment for 4 days, and a plethora of tests, including spinal tap, multiple mri?s, and probably over 20 blood tests (11 at one draw), I was released 3-18-2021 and still can?t see above the equator line of my left eye. And I also am extremely sensitive to light. I also have sensitivity inside my eye as best described as a soreness, especially when I try to look upwards. I have a follow up appt with the ophthalmologists that I first saw that advised me to get to the hospital. And that is on mar 26th 2021.  to mention another point of interest, my granddaughters boyfriends mother is a charge nurse at the emergency ward at the hospital, and she has said that they also have recently encountered emergency patients, who have recently received moderna, and are also having issues with eye problems. What problems in particular, I haven?t a clue at this time.  This is at the very least, extremely alarming to me, and I have no idea whether I may completely lose all function of my left eye., or not. But I adamantly feel this should be investigated by the cdc and any and all other agencies that should be involved.  I would be willing to have further discussions via phone or whatever to help you out with an investigation.

The outcome of the events, hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events (dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding these event (hallucination) has been provided at this time. Medical history and concomitant medications are required for assessment. However, further information has been requested. However, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting are expected for mRNA1273.

                                                Not sure if covid vaccine caused this, but this is what happened - Received covid vaccine.  two days later had violent shakes in the night.  Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for &#34;flu b&#34;.  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a &#34;spot&#34; on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat &#34;pneumonia&#34;.  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was &#34;atypical and abnormal&#34; what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.

                                                At 5:00 AM Sunday morning, extreme pain, achy all over, headache, aching all the way down legs, back, neck.  Almost like having the COVID virus.  Rolled out of bed, could not stand up or hardly walk to the bathroom.  Felt very faint, had to hold onto wall.  Was very sweaty, running temperature, cold sweats.  Just kept getting worse and thought about going to the ER and then decided to put it off until talking to somebody.  Called 2-1-1 and the lady told her that it was part of the side-effects to it.  She told her to call her doctor, and they were not in on the weekend.  This morning, the doctor called and asked if she had Corona, his other doctor retired and got this one the first of January.  Took 3 months to recover from the COVID and was on antibiotics, and told her because he have antibodies.  Feeling better, still having some achiness.

He took Tylenol for the symptoms.

                                                March 3, 2021 SUBJECT: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Side Effects This letter/email is addressed to a number of individuals with a request that you seriously evaluate the below discussion, take action to alert medical staff of your respective agencies of these side effects, and work with the manufacturer, Moderna, to address them.  As the recipient of them it has thus far been debilitating and interfered with my daily activities.  It is my hope that the medical community can find ways to prevent or treat them such that daily activity can be unimpeded.     I will first provide a chronology of my medical history and my Moderna vaccine experience.  Then I will discuss my observations. My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

                                                He developed very labored breathing on Tuesday night.  By Wednesday morning , upon waking it was severly worse.  I would have taken him to the ER had I been home.  When I returned home around 11am, he was having a very hard time breathing.  I got him a rescue inhaler to use.  He had a dailysis treatment that day, during the treatment they kept him on oxygen.  I called Dr office to inform them, they ordered a new inhaler and told me if the symptoms did not decrease by 72 hours to inform them.  His breathing did get somewhat better but he did not have his enegry levels that he had previously or his appeatite.  12 days after his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine he went into cardiac arrest in the home with myself and husband present.

                                                Bell&#39;s Palsy; .A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 79 years-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced Bell&#39;s palsy (facial paralysis).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medication reported included metformin.  On 29 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 012L20A), intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 29 Jan 2021, after the administration of vaccine, the patient developed Bell&#39;s palsy. The patient went to the emergency room (ER) for treatment but was unable to get the condition resolved. The patient was referred to a neurologist, but the side effects were still present up to this point.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the event, Bell&#39;s palsy, was not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Currently waiting for dental work (crown removal and replacement to treat cavity).    2/18/21 Started to experience toothache (R) which got worse as the day progressed.  Tylenol didn&#39;t help.  Took one tab of Percocet (5-325) to allow me to sleep.    2/19/21 Contacted dentist and was prescribed Penicillin VK 500 mg. Started Penicillin around 3 pm.   2/19/21 ~6 pm onset shakes, chills, sweating, low grade fever (~100.2), nausea, headache, weakness,  difficulty in standing.  Took more tylenol, lay down, fell asleep for approximately 3 hours. Woke briefly took my nighttime meds (atrovastatin, metoprolol, ranolazine, baby aspirin.) Additional information for Item 18:  2/20/21 Felt better when I woke up.  Temp normal. Ate breakfast.  Mild stomach ache. Around 3 pm onset of sweating and chills, shakes. Low grade temp (~100)   2/22/21 Fully recovered.  No lingering issues.  Not sure whether what I experienced is related to the Moderna vaccine or a reaction to the Percocet I took to alleviate the severe pain associated with my toothache.

From ER MDs note: EKG was normal sinus rhythm, narrow QRS, delayed transition, minimal lateral st depression V4. Patient IV access on arrival, would Brady down to the 40s 1 time as low as 27 but remained alert, blood pressure is not dip.  Troponin was mildly elevated and decision was made to transfer the patient.  Prior to transfer is necessary to rule out pulmonary embolism, intracranial injury Patient wished to proceed with CT angio chest and noncontrast CT of head which were without acute findings.  Patient given aspirin 81 mg to supplement the 81 mg he had earlier today.  Discussed with hospitalist, patient was accepted in transfer. Suspect this is combination of patient&#39;s beta blockade with underlying sinus node dysfunction.  Patient does have prominent lower extremity swelling and suspect pulmonary hypertension despite treatment with CPAP but cannot exclude valvular heart disease.  Patient was went to Hospital.  Symptoms thought to be unlikely from seizure.  Doubt CVA, ongoing cardiac ischemia.

He was initially tachycardic, febrile and had leukocytosis 18K, with admission labs with creatinine 1.8, lactate 2.4. He had need for supplemental oxygen and was placed on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Respiratory viral panel including SARS COV2 PCR was neg. Blood cultures from 2/24, 2/27, 3/3 were negative. CT chest showed some prominent mediastinal adenopathy which was increased from prior CT 2017. Also had axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. 2/27 he had a code blue called for bradycardia in context of receiving ativan for a CT study. Antibiotics  were changed to Vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin, acyclovir on 2/28. Multiple attempts by multiple providers at doing a lumbar puncture have been unsuccessful.  Bronchoscopy 3/2 with left lower lobe secretions. Cultures negative. He has stayed incessantly febrile and working diagnosis is probable underlying lymphoproliferative neoplasm immunostimulated by vaccine.

                                                Patient is an 79 year old male who had his 2nd Moderna vaccination in his dominant right arm Thursday afternoon.  Upon awakening Friday morning, he had difficulty walking.  His legs were strong enough to hold him, but he was unstable.  He also had some numbness on the palmar surfaces of some index and middle fingers of his left hand.  His speech was somewhat garbled, but when his wife would encourage him to repeat himself, he could enunciate more clearly.  He had some nonspecific difficulty swallowing.  He attributed this all to adverse reaction to the vaccination, which would pass...  Friday mid day his wife took him to the barber, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  Later in the day on Friday they went for car ride, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  He had no other episodes of nausea.  He had no fevers or chills.  He had no visual disturbances.  He had no other numbness or paresthesias.  He was aware of no clear weakness.  Finally today, the gait instability persisted and the numbness in the left hand, so he came to the ER for evaluation.   Patient is currently recovering in the hospital

On 12/29/20, he began to have coughing, increased shortness of breath and runny nose with course breath sounds in his bilateral lower lobes. A chest xray was done and he was initiated on oral azithromycin and cefepime for a bilateral pneumonia. On 1/3/21, he continued to decline with increasing shortness of breath and was subsequently transferred to acute care medicine. All COVID tests have been negative since the presumptive positive on 11/9/20. He did have a CTA that ruled out PE but did show bilateral pneumonia. His antibiotics have been changed to meropenem, vancomycin and IV azithromycin. He remains on acute care at time and has not required ICU care.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included type II diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, heart failure, acid reflux, and urinary retention. Concomitant medications included metformin, gabapentin, furosemide, spironolactone, omeprazole, and tamsulosin.   On 06 Jan 2021, hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the evening of 06 Jan 2021, hours after vaccination, the patient began feeling chills and discomfort. Overnight he began to experience night sweats and did not sleep at all.   During the night on 07 Jan 2021, the patient experienced night sweats and had delirium. When he tried to get out of bed, he collapsed. No treatment information was provided.   On 11 Jan 2021 and 12 Jan 2021, the patient began to feel better. He no longer had night sweats or delirium. He returned to his exercise routine at about 50 percent of what he normally did although he continued to feel weak.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided, although the patient reported he was not sure if he would take the second dose.  The outcome for the events, night sweats and delirium, was considered resolved. The outcome for the events, chills, discomfort, did not sleep at all, and collapsed, was considered resolving. The event, weak, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the events, chills, discomfort, night sweats, did not sleep at all, delirium, collapsed, and weak, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine due to feeling well before the vaccine and feeling more or less disabled after receiving it.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 80-year-old, male subject with medical history of type II diabetes and diabetic neuropathy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of delirium and non-serious unexpected event of asthenia, discomfort, insomnia, fall, and night sweats, and non-serious expected event of chills. The event of discomfort, insomnia, chills and night sweats occurred 1 day; the event of delirium, and fall occurred 2 days and asthenia occurred 6 days after mRNA-1273 administration.  The subject was on metformin for diabetes ty II and gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy, Lasix and spironolactone for heart failure, omeprazole for acid reflux and Flomax for urinary retention. Treatment details not provided. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Client developed a mild covid infection 12/8/21 and recovered. He was admitted 12/25 with hypogycemia and mild weakness and sent home He was given his first dose of the Moderna vaccine 1/4/21 at approximately 9AM covid vaccine clinic He developed weakness the next day  (1/5) prompting admission to a hospital and then transition to subacute rehabilitation briefly  Work up at hospital revealed progressive respiratory failure and pneumonia requiring intubation and progressive ascending weakness and sensory loss without upper motor neuron changes.  MRI : nerve root enhancement LP : protein 40, &#43;/- 80 lymphocytes, cultures negative B 12 and B6 normal extensive CSF testing still pending campylobacter and Musk antibodies negative Neurology diagnosed likely AIDP (Guillain-Barre) and an EMG is planned for the near future.  Neurology felt the cause of his GBS was likely his covid infection verses his Moderna vaccination He was treated with plasmapheresis.  Client received dexamethasone, remdesivir, and zosyn and doxycycline when progressive leukocytosis and procalcitonin elevation was noted. Candida was cultured from tracheal aspirates but felt most likely d/t colonization with an option to treat further if he did not continue to improve. He is now extubated, unable to swallow and has profound weakness and distal sensory loss. He will transition to Acute rehab in the near future.  Comorbidities:as described in the above section and... DM2, CKD3, HTN, DJD, BPH ( h/o prostate surgery), h/o Lumbar surgery and hernia repair, GERD, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia.  Possible etiologies of his AIDP ( GBS)  would include his recent covid infection, the Moderna Vaccine, or other undiagnosed infection. He got his flu shot 9/25 ( fluzone sanofi) so this is not likely to be the culprit

                                                36 hours after vaccination, the patient had increased respiratory distress. He was placed on high flow nasal cannula oxygen with mild improvement. He then continued to be hypotensive requiring IV fluids and subsequently IV vasopressors. Patient&#39;s BP was stabilized with vasopresor, however he continued to deteriorate clinically with altered mental status and lethargy, concerned for bowel peroration based on physical exam by MD. He was then emergency intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He was then transferred to acute care hospital near by.

                                                Acute pancreatitis; Acute renal failure; Low blood pressure; Weakness; Decreased appetite; Fatigue; Alanine aminotransferase increased; Aspartate aminotransferase increased; Troponin increased; Lipase increased; Blood bilirubin increased; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning an 81-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed an odd presentation of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue.  The patient&#39;s medical history included advanced dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism and possible leukemia. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 08 Jan 2021, three days after vaccination, the patient developed symptoms of weakness, decreased appetite, and fatigue.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was admitted into the hospital with a diagnosis of low blood pressure,acute renal failure,acute pancreatitis,alanine aminotransferase increased,aspartate aminotransferase increased, troponin increased,lipase increased and blood bilirubin increased. Abnormal lab results included &#34;significantly elevated&#34; aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, lipase up to 1900, and &#34;slightly elevated&#34; troponin of 0.079.  On 13 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had improved, and he was discharged. Treatment for the event included two liters of intravenous fluid and supportive care.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.    The events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, were considered resolved on 13 Jan 2021.   The physician assessed the events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, as not related to mRNA-1273. The physician&#39;s rationale was that the patient may have had a gallstone obstructing the pancreatic duct and once the stone passed, the patient got better with supportive care and slow administration of fluids.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 81-year-old male patient with medical history of dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism, and possible leukemia, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, the non-serious listed event of fatigue, and the non-serious unlisted events of weakness, decreased appetite, elevated aspartate transaminase, elevated alanine transaminase, elevated bilirubin, elevated lipase, and elevated troponin.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on the current available information and in agreement with the physician reporter&#39;s assessment, the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273, noting the rapid improvement after administration of IV fluids.

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental. Patient had echocardiogram without right to left shunt or clot identified, no known history of atrial fibrillation. Was monitored on telemetry for the duration of his hospitalization without any noted arrhythmias, discharged on e patch for 14-day outpatient monitoring.

Patients&#39; medical history, as provided by patient&#39;s spouse, was emergency room(ER) admission in November 2020 because he had a congested chest (he had fluid around his heart). At that time, they gave him pills for kidney function. Other concomitant medication reported was Coumadin, blood thinner. Two weeks before receiving the vaccine, patient&#39;s EKG was normal.  On 11 Feb 2021, in the morning, patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273(BATCH/LOT # 007M20A) probably in the right arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, approximately after 15 minutes of receiving vaccine, they left and patient was immediately very tired, his hands were shaking. So, patient&#39;s spouse made them down sleep for too long. On Friday, 12 Feb 2021 she tried to pick him up, but he was tired, exhausted, and sick.   On Saturday, 13 Feb 2021, she brought him a coffee and he couldn&#39;t hold it because his hands were shaking, so she gave him the coffee and then made him pee on the bed because he couldn&#39;t get up. At lunch time she made him eat something and he fell sleep again. His wife was hanging around him all day and around 7:30pm she realized that he was cold, and his neck was sweating, she couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat. So, she called emergency services and when they arrived, her husband&#39;s blood pressure went down until he died. Treatment for the events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  Patient was pronounced dead on 13 Feb 2021 20:00. The cause of death was not provided. The plans for an autopsy were not provided.  The events of blood pressure went down until he died and couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat were fatal. The outcome for the remaining events were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 81 year old, male patient, who experienced a serious event of death among others, 2 days after receiving mRNA- 1273 (Lot# 007M20A). Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time. Further information has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Unknown cause of death

                                                My dad got the Moderna Vaccine on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 in his left arm at the Mall injection site for the Health Department. He was told that the side effects could mean his arm hurting, tiredness, headache, and even a low grade fever. Additionally, the site informed us both (as I was with him to get the injection) that this was all normal and not to seek medical attention unless these symptoms last longer than 72 hours. That evening, my dad was experiencing all of those symptoms, and went to bed at 7pm. A little after 10am on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, when he awoke, my dad went to the bathroom vomiting. This was where he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Fire/Rescue was dispatched about 10:30am after my mom started CPR. County Fire Rescue EMTs and Paramedics continued CPR and other attempts at reviving him all the way to Hospital Emergency Department. He was pronounced dead at 12:14pm on Wednesday, January 13, 2021. We have no doubt my dad, following the instructions of the injection facility, thought he was just experiencing the side effects of the vaccine. He had no chance. Had this injection been done in the RIGHT arm, perhaps he could have recognized the arm numbness being that of an impending heart attack. We really miss Dad. He served this country with distinction for over 50 years, and we believe his country failed him.

He has very thin skin and suffered several skin tears.  We applied pressure and bandaged wounds and observed pt for 30 minutes.  He did not hit his head.  Followed up with pt&#39;s wife next day and she reported that his arm was sore, but no other complaints.  I recommended they see a Dr. for his skin tears.

Went to ED - &#34;Patient is an 82yo male with a history of chronic Afib on Eliquis, HTN, and bradykinesia (thought to be PD) who presented to the ED with a CC of weakness after receiving 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine. He also had low-grade fever and difficulties ambulating. In the ED he was febrile at 38.5C and HR 159bpm. EKG revealed Afib RVR. BP was stable. He was given Cardizem 10mg IV x1. Basic labs were unremarkable. COVID negative. CXR negative. He was given Tylenol for fever and admitted under observation. He remained afebrile and heart rate remained controlled with home Cardizem dosing. Cardiology was consulted who will refer him to their clinic to establish routine care with their service. PT/OT recommended home with home PT/OT. The patient overall felt much improved compared to admission and felt ready for discharge. He was discharged home in stable condition.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 031620A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient experienced little bruising in the arm. On 12 Feb 2021, the patient was a bit off. On Sunday, 28 Feb 2021, in the evening, the patient got cold, and within minutes his entire whole body was in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe were in pain. It felt like it was invaded with COVID. He went to hospital and got tested for COVID, Strep throat and Flu, and all three test results were negative. On an unknown date, the patient experienced tightening in his throat muscle and he went to the hospital where he was admitted.  While there, they did every possible test, chest MRI, Neck MRI, all possible viral tests, and rapid and full COVID test.  The rapid and full COVID tests came back negative.  Results for chest MRI, neck MRI and viral tests were not provided.  The hospital also performed a blood culture for bacteria. Results were not provided.  The patient was unable to move much, his blood pressure and oxygen were a little unstable.

He stated that he recently bled due to taking blood thinner.  Treatment included major antibiotic treatments and steroids for pain during the hospital stay. The patient was still taking prednisone at a tapering dose.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The events of weak in terms of walking, coughing were unresolved, while the outcome of the events of tightening in his throat muscle, unable to move much, unstable blood pressure, unstable oxygen, bled due to blood thinner, Bruising in arm, cold, entire body in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on a strong temporal association between the reported events and administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded.  Myalgia and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine

Had full tx done and brought to ER. Reports still feels weak after dialysis.    84 year old male comes in today after completing dialysis for evaluation of generalized weakness x 5 days. He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.   REASON FOR ADMISSION/ ADMISSION DIAGNOSES   Sepsis cause unclear

                                                Muscle pull; A spontaneous report was received from a physician, concerning an 84-year-old patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced muscle pull.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medications included blood thinners.  On 31 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 31 Dec 2020, on the same day of vaccine administration, the patient experienced severe pain in the arm, shoulder, and front of his chest into his back. He was taken to the emergency room (ER) where he was diagnosed with a muscle pull and was admitted to the hospital for one night. Treatment for the event included 500mg paracetamol. At the time of the report, the patient was still experiencing symptoms.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the event, muscle pull, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Company comment: This case concerns an 84-year-old male patient, who experienced unexpected serious event of muscle pull. The event occurred 1 days after the administration of the first and only dose of the Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273). Based on the known cause for muscle pull which is mostly due to an overstretched or torn muscle, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 administration.

Each day the pain has gotten worse and now a week later he is in the worst shape so far.  The primary care Physician has associated the symptoms with the vaccine and on the 25th he saw a cardiologist who again blamed it on the vaccine

Given weakness, difficulty urinating, and gross hematuria, patient was sent to the ER.  ER nurse was called and given report

Instead of him using the rollater to come from his bedroom I got the wheel chair out of the care and got him to the table where I fed him a little breakfast.  His blood pressure was low then high (I don&#39;t now have the readings) By 5 pm I called the ambulance.  He was in the hospital until I transferred him to hospice 6 days later.  He died in hospice 4 days after that.

He was confused, no appetite, weak, and generally not himself.  Prior to receiving his second dose he was alert, eating, no complaints of any discomfort or issues. The next day following his second dose he passed away from what we think was a massive heart attack.   As a family we feel his weakened state contributed to this and not the fault of the vaccine but felt it important to notify you in case individuals such as patient should be monitored in a different way or use a different vaccine.

                                                Vaccination and observation period successfully completed without adverse event.  The patient&#39;s significant other reported neither of them were feeling well on 2/21/2021.  Approximately 28 hours after vaccination, the patient was found unresponsive in the bathtub.  EMS arrived within 5 minutes, resuscitation attempt was unsuccessful, CPR terminated at 1503 and the patient pronounced dead.  The Medical examiner refused the case on the basis of lack of jurisdiction, and the remains were moved to a local funeral home.  No autopsy was performed.  This event is not thought to be related to the vaccination event or the vaccine, the death is thought to be from natural causes.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not included. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 27 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 06 Feb 2021, approximately 10 days after the patient received the vaccine, he experienced a fast heart rate, dizziness, cold body temperature, and atrial fibrillation. (The wife reports that they purchased an EKG machine, and this is what the machine showed them. Unaware if he had this before the vaccine or not.)  Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 was unknown.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cold body temperature, dizziness and atrial fibrillation, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, the event occurred 9 days after vaccine administration and very limited information regarding this patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were event is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.  Further information has been requested.

We had to have help from a man and a women to help get him on the toilet, off the toilet, to sit him up on the couch, getting in and out of bed. He could not function on his own. It effected him mentally. Right now he couldn&#39;t even that this happened. On the 15th he seemed normal. But now like a week later his memory and strength was bad. Today he is not that bad. It seems to be coming and going with the problem mentally. I took him to the doctor today.

Daughter was home with pt and after he went to the bathroom she reports pt was out of breath, however that has been chronic/ongoing for him due to his diagnosis of COPD, pulmonary HTN and metastatic lung cancer. After sitting and resting in a chair, she states patient became unresponsive. She called 911 who told her he had no pulse and was not breathing. She states that they were not able to resuscitate him. Pt had been suspected to be positive for COVID as he had symptoms of increased cough, congestion and rhinitis. Daughter (that is primary caregiver and lives in home with patient) tested positive for COVID on 1/31/21. She started having symptoms on 1/25/21. Patient started having symptoms on 1/31/21. No COVID test confirmed prior to pt&#39;s death. Patient had a definitive diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma in October 2020. History of multimorbidity. He did have a 60 pack year history of smoking. Most likely cause of death from available records is metastatic lung cancer, with other serious diagnoses contributing.
