                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

I got home from work, and having no appetite due to nausea, I fell asleep on the couch around 1800hrs. Severe fatigue had set in. I did not wake up until 0500hrs the next morning to go to work on January 5th. I felt like I had not slept at all, however the scratchy throat had gone away. I worked all day with the nausea and headache. Throughout the day I developed chills, cold sweats, diarrhea, fever, and I felt like my mind was foggy (I had felt feverish since Monday night, but Tuesday was the first time I took my temperature that showed I had a fever.) I went home that night and slept all evening and well into the next morning. On the morning of Wednesday, January 6th, my symptoms had again gotten worse, so I called my primary care physician. He fit me in and tested me for the flu and for COVID. He prescribed me Ibuprofen for the headache/fever, and Ondansetron for the nausea/vomiting. My flu test came back negative on Thursday, January 7th, and my COVID test came back negative on Friday, January 8th. The fever finally broke on Friday evening and Saturday, January 9th  was the first day I woke up without a fever.  I still have the headache as of today, January 11th, and a low grade fever has returned. I am still very fatigued as well.

                                                Received the first dose 12:30pm Thursday(2/11). Around 6pm that same night I notice the first symptom. I had a super strong headache that lasted the next 24 hours or so. Still lingering now but not as bad. Around 3am Friday (2/12) I woke up with chills and the inject spot was extremely tender. All day Friday I had signs of a fever. Chills and felt cold but body was hot to the touch. This lasted all day and it kept Me in bed the whole day.  Around 6pm Friday night, my injection spot was extremely sore , and there was a red circle, about the size of a gold ball around the spot. That?s also when I  noticed I had shortness of breath and was having a little difficulty breathing. Around 8pm I noticed I had really high anxiety that was abnormal. It went away in about 30 mins or so. I thought it was strange as I normally don?t have anxiety that bad. I went to sleep around 10pm and woke up at 5am itchy with a red rash/hives on the upper half of my body, mostly the neck and chest area. Also the red circle around the injection site grew to the size of a baseball. The headache is still there but not as bad . Maybe 2/10 Severeness. I feel better in terms of the fever and breathing today (2/13).  However the rash/hives has gotten worse and seems to be spreading slowly. I plan on taking Benadryl when I grab it from the store in 30 mins or so

EMS was summoned at 8:10am and transported the patient to the emergency department for assessment. RN reports that the patient has no previous history of seizure. Symptoms have resolved and RN reports that the patient has had no recurrent symptoms or seizures while in the emergency department.

                                                I woke up at 3 A.M. the following morning with a bad migraine and dry mouth. I was also very nauseous so I went to my kitchen to have a glass of water. On the way back to the bedroom I felt my blood pressure bottom out and lost consciousness briefly and regained consciousness lying on the floor and my wife helping me up. I was able to make it to the bathroom and lay against the toilet because I thought I was going to throw up. I had that same feeling of my blood pressure dropping and again lost consciousness and regained consciousness with my head laying on the toilet seat. I also had sever chills and body aches, particularly in the neck area. I also struggled talking and communicating with my wife. She tells me I wasn?t making sense and my words were slurred.

I do have a history of these from shots I have had in the past. I got the pharmacists attention and told her I was feeling faint and asked for some water. Once she left, breathing in my throat felt significantly constricted. I had a reaction to clear my throat a few times but that didn&#39;t not affect anything. The pharmacist came back with water and an ice pack that she held against my neck. During this episode I was able to drink water still. The severity of the breathing issue leveled off and eventually I was able to breathe normally again. The whole thing lasted 1-2 minutes. It felt longer thinking back on it but I don&#39;t think it lasted as long as my impression of the episode.  After that I felt tingling followed by shakiness in my extremities which was more typical of the fainting side effects ive had in the past. I&#39;ve never experienced breathing issues with other shots I&#39;ve received in the past. The pharmacist kept me there to monitor me for 30-45 minutes. No additional medication was administered

                                                (Day 1 was day of vaccination). Sore arm started around the end of the day that was vaccinated. Sore arm got worse on day 2 and became extremely painful, especially if bumped. At 6pm on day 2 I started to feel ill and had aches and chills. I felt better the morning of day 3. Sore arm took a few days to get better.

He got very pale and the lost consciousness. He is in a wheelchair so we got him out of the chair and laying flat on the ground where he regained consciousness fairly quickly. 911 was called and they did take him in ambulance for follow-up in the emergency room. Vitals were taken while waiting for ambulance to arrive, but those were given to the EMTs.

                                                I received the vaccine on 3/25/2021 at 5:30PM and had general soreness in the arm the injection took place. Soreness was remarkable until four days after the injection. Night of 3/30/2021 at approximately around 9:30 pm I felt soreness in the left axillary region (in my left armpit). This at first was thought to be unremarkable as I was wearing a tight shirt at the time. However, after switching to looser clothing the soreness and pain continued and now considered remarkable. The day after (3/31/21 Today of this report), I still have pain and what feels to be a swollen lymph node in the left axillary region (in my left armpit). This is sore and painful and feels palpable.

                                                Written by Doctor: April 7, 2021 2:09 p.m. DOB 2/07/1995, male, received his second dose of Moderna Vaccine (Lot 019B21A) at 1:13 p.m.  He stood up and walked to the usher?s table to have his vaccine card completed.  Approximately one minute after receiving his vaccine, he had a syncopal episode falling directly backwards striking his head on the floor.  I, MD did not directly witness the fall, but everyone who witnessed the fall said that he fell completely unimpeded to the floor.  I was notified and immediately assisted the patient who was with his girlfriend.  Patient initially appeared ?out?, but almost immediately opened his eyes and asked what happened.  His skin was cool and clammy.  A pulse oximeter was placed on his finger registering 98% o2 and a pulse of 53.  I kept him lying on the floor until he was completely awake and aware of his surroundings.  At the time he said his neck was not sore, but his head was sore.  Approximately 2-3 minutes later, we were able to assist him in standing to immediately sit down in a wheelchair.  He was taken to the cot in the hallway just outside the Medical Observation where I was able to help him to stand and then lie down.  An icepack was provided to put on the back of his head, he was provided water, Gatorade, and two cookies.  Patient said that he hadn?t eaten all day and had been feeling slightly hungry prior to his vaccination.  I had patient move all extremities and asked his questions to verify that he was full awake and oriented to person, place, and time.  Patient girlfriend  stayed with patient while he ate his cookies.  I addressed my concerns about patient striking his head on the floor and the possibility of a closed head injury.  Girlfriend felt that patient was now completely back to his normal state of mind.  I had patient remain lying down for 20 minutes.  When I returned to check on him, he was sitting up and wanted to leave.  I told him that he needed to be able to walk up and down the hallway before I would feel comfortable letting him leave.  He stood up and walked halfway down the hallway before saying he was lightheaded.  I immediately went to him to lead him back to the cot, but he insisted that he needed to use the bathroom to urinate.  Both girlfriend and I stood in the doorway to assist patient if he needed, but he was able to finish urinating, then returned and sat in the wheelchair.  I spoke to both Doctors via a phone call and had spoken to someone earlier.  After letting them know that patient did not want an ambulance called, but I was going to strongly recommend he go to the nearest ER before returning home, I returned to the patient.  Vital signs at 1:53 were Pulse Ox of 98%, pulse 78, and blood pressure sitting of 140/75.  Again, I strongly recommended that girlfriend drive him to an ED for an evaluation and possible cat scan.  Patient also now had some paracervical neck pain which I also said should be evaluated.  Patient and girlfriend both insisted they didn?t want an ambulance called and girlfriend felt comfortable taking patient out of the clinic.  Patient said he was hungry, and they were going to get food first.  Girlfriend gave me her phone number (xxx)xxx-xxxx and I gave her my phone number (xxx-xxx-xxxx).  I told her I was going to call her every hour to check on patient and told her to call me at any time.  I recommended acetaminophen for the headache and other vaccine symptoms but no ibuprofen because of the possible head injury.  I recommended to immediately call an ambulance or go to an ED for nausea, worsening headache, confusion, or drowsiness.  Girlfriend is not to let patient sleep longer than 30 minutes at a time.  Patient was able to walk out of the clinic easily under his own power without any assistance.  He stated he was feeling much better.

                                                I received my first Moderna shot on March 24th. Just had a sore arm the next day.   April 2nd: Around 1pm at work I was starting to feel a headache coming on. By about 2-3pm it was worse and felt tired/drowsy. I ate supper then went to take a nap at 7:30pm. I woke up at about 10:30pm, checked the time and just felt out of it so I went right back to sleep.  April 3rd: I slept until my dog woke me at about 5:50am and felt pretty good, still minor headache and some chills. During the night I did feel some soreness in my arm that got the covid shot. After I showered I checked my arm and it was swelled up with a rash like redness maybe an inch in diameter. I was fine for most of the day enjoying the nice weather outside. Then about 6pm I started to feel the headache again and some chills. Went to bed at about 10:30pm, headache was bad, had the chills, started coughing some, and just didn?t feel normal, took some Tylenol to help through the night.  April 4th: Slept through the night fine, woke up with a mild headache and a sore throat. Had some dry coughs occasionally throughout the day, but was fine most of the day.  I did check my temperature throughout these past few days and all check were normal.  April 5th: Almost back to normal, still have a sore throat and cough. My arm rash near the shot area has gone away, just a little swollen.  April 6th: Back to normal health.

                                                Ever since about 2-3 hours following my vaccination shot, I felt soreness in the left arm where I received the shot. It felt as if somebody punched me in the arm fairly hard and 2 days later I am still unable to move my left arm around too much. It is imperative that I can access my car whenever I need to so this is a major inconvenience for me and if this can be avoided or if all patients can know beforehand about this effect I would feel better about this entire thing. I did not know my arm would be sore for this long.

I am unsure if this is linked to the vaccine but I have seen that this is a potential side effect and thought it may be linked but unsure. They diagnosed me with Bell?s Palsy and my right side of my face has still not been working properly.

He was advised to sit for an additional 30 minutes since the event so that the nurse and pharmacist could monitor him.

                                                About 7 min after my shot I stood up to walk into the next room and became very light headed and was ready to pass out. They immediately put me into a wheel chair but I wasn?t getting better until they laid me down in the stretcher. My lips turned blue and I think I was having an allergic reaction to the shot. It was hard for me to breathe before laying down on the stretcher my heart rate dropped and my blood pressure. It took me 30-40 min to come back to stand up and slowly walk out. My arm was super sore afterwards and I would have little shocking pain flashes in my chest. I felt tired and run down/ sensitive the rest of the night. The next day my arm was still super sore and I still feel very tired and run down.  The doctor on site took care of me and they put the stickers on me just in case they needed to revive me. I was sinking quickly but luckily when I laid down I got better.

He went to work and was unable to move his arm and had to leave work early and took the next day off as well. He said this continued for three days after the vaccine. He reported that he did contact his physician who told him to give it some time and if it  got worse to make an appointment to be seen, stating that all they would do is give him an anti-inflammatory to reduce swelling. The patient told the physician that he already had some for another condition and would just use that and did not go in to see her. He said that it was still not 100% on 5/19/21 but wanted to proceed with the shot in the same arm.  He was able to make circles with his arms over his head after the immunization was given a little lower that where the first one was administered.  He said he had looked up the symptoms that it might be a frozen shoulder/nerve issue.

                                                Roughly 15 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started to develop muscle aches. Within 30 minutes of the aches, they became severe. Aches were primarily located in the lower back, shoulders, hips, and calves. 30 minutes following,  I started to feel very fatigued and had labored breathing. Another 1.5 later, I developed chills and had flu like symptoms. By the afternoon, I had broken into a fever and had mild nausea. Besides the muscle aches, as one symptom onset, the others seemed to fade away. By 5:00 in the evening, (roughly 25 hours after receipt of vaccine) the symptoms quickly subsided. The only residual side-effects within the rest of a 48 hour period were soreness in the area of the injection, and mild headache.

                                                Ever since receiving the vaccine, two months ago now, my left arm has had chronic pain usually radiating out from the injection site but sometimes spreading across my entire shoulder and down to my elbow. I also have quite a bit of pain depending on the motion I try to take and a fairly regular (and worsening) throbbing sensation around where the injection was. - I also regularly feel like I have no strength in my left arm/grip and it?s gotten to the point where it?s now affecting daily life.  Some days, the area around the site swells up and I feel a burning sensation instead of a painful pulsing or throbbing  Painkillers (ibuprofen) don?t seem to help very much though and sometimes I?ll wake up in the middle of the night from rolling onto my left arm and causing the pain to intensify.  I?m not sure if the pain is truly a side effect of the vaccine or if the volunteer performing the vaccine did something wrong when administering it.

                                                I woke up feeling a slight pain on my left side of my chest near my heart. When I breathed in too heavily, I experienced that pain. Throughout the day, it continued and slowly got worse. As of now, I can feel that there is a slight discomfort at rest and I am unable to inhale too deeply or laugh without having that pain return. I don&#39;t think it could be a result from anything else, as I wasn&#39;t sick recently and do not have any conditions or take any medications. I&#39;m waiting to see if it continues through the night into tomorrow to schedule a doctor&#39;s appointment.

Rash started in chest/upper torso and progressed to bilateral arms, back, upper buttocks, and thighs. Rash feels like a sunburn in that it makes the subject feel warm. Rash is blanchable and fully pinpoint-macular, no papules or plaques.   At approx. 36 hours post-vaccine, the rash had spread down both arms and up the neck, sparing the face. The rash gets intensely pruritic when scratched or itched. There is no pain, shortness of breath, altered mental status, or other compromise of the subject&#39;s health or well-being.

                                                Had no symptoms prior to injection. After injection, quickly developed moderate pain at injection site that eventually became severe. Over the rest of the day, developed a severe headache, severe muscle aches (not just at injection site), severe fatigue, fever of 100.6F, moderate joint aches (not just in arm, but all over body - neck is worst), and general weakness (I almost fell walking to the bathroom and I&#39;m in decently good shape). Toward the evening, I started struggling with thermal homeostasis - I was simultaneously sweating and shivering. The combination of these was severe enough that I had extreme difficulty sleeping last night and woke up at least once an hour, getting &lt;6 hours of sleep after lying in bed for almost 12 hours. Right now (23h post vaccination), the pain at the injection site has gotten significantly less bad, but I still have a splitting headache, fever of 100.3F,  moderate fatigue/weakness, and mild muscle/joint pains across my whole body. I&#39;m unsure how much the headache this morning is from sleep deprivation.   At no point did I lose sense of smell or taste, have a sore throat, cough, runny nose/nasal congestion, or shortness of breath.

                                                On  the morning of 3/3/2021 i felt a slight amount of discomfort in right armpit. The following night, 3/4/2021, muscle pain in upper back started to develop. The morning of 3/5/2021 the muscle pain had spread from upper back to neck and shoulders. The pain was severe enough to impede the ability to get dressed or drive.  I took Ibuprofen and noticed little relief, then took 1g of acetaminophen and experienced some relief. Pain persisted at same degree until the evening of  3/7/2021  where pain had started to noticeably subside. On morning of 3/8/2021,  armpit discomfort had ceased and muscle pain and been reduced to that of very slight soreness.  as on 3/10/2021 all pain had disappeared.

                                                My arm became very sore, to the point of near complete immobility, 4 hrs after injection. The condition has not improved, and it is now 39 hours after injection. Regular, everyday tasks are very difficult. Pain is about a 7.5/10.  Also, 24 hrs after injection I experienced a fever. The fever lasted for 12 hours without coming below 103 degrees, and went up to 105.2 degrees at its highest. This was accompanied by extreme chills. I have also have body aches, which are likely a result of the fever, and the fact that I haven&#39;t slept in 2 nights because of these side effects.

His face was slightly red on one side.  The patient stated he was breathing normally, but wasn&#39;t sure if it was an allergic reaction.  As a precaution I offered 50 mg of diphenhydramine to the patient, and he accepted and took it by mouth.  I offered to call paramedics, patient refused.  I observed the patient for 20 min more, and at the end of the 20 min the patient felt better and went home.

I thought I would have go some adverse affect already so wasn&#39;t worried. When we went to bed at 9 I started getting chills and a fever of 101, 102F. I had my electric matress pad turned up to max and I wasn&#39;t even sweating but, was shaking with cold. The chill faded at 3am ish and now I just have a fever of about 100F

                                                I randomly got hives and its lasted about 2 weeks now. Once the Benadryl runs out then I start to feel an itch and the itch leaded to that whole area red and bumpy. The only thing I have gotten so far is a steroid and Benadryl. only thing that works is the Benadryl.   When I first went into the ER I went because I got hive and ive never had hives before in my life.   I went 3 days later because I had a migraine, felt sick and had trouble swallowing.

It was also difficult to raise my arm past 45 degrees without some pain. Around 24 hours after the shot was administered, I started to feel more immense pain and swelling around the area of the shot and now felt pain even when my arm was resting, with the sensation sometimes traveling to my fingers. Taking two tylenol helped reduce the swelling and the pain significantly after about 20-35 minutes.

Right as he was observed to be breathing normally with a steady pulse, patient had mild seizure with jerking movements. He was turned to his side during seizure event lasting no longer that 2 minutes. Patient then regained consciousness and was kept on his side. Was alert and oriented. He knew where he was, who he was, what day it was. He was able to answer all 911 dispatcher questions relayed to him. Dispatcher advised he could sit up on floor, which he did. PharmD stayed right behind him until paramedics arrived. He was kept talking to stay alert. It was unknown if he hit his head on the initial fall. Paramedics arrived and checked BP/Pulse/EKG. Pt then had a gasp/shake attack that paramedic notated as a panic induced episode. He calmed and was transferred to ER

                                                Patient waited the 15 minute waiting period sitting down and appeared fine. Patient began walking around the store with family members. Patient became dizzy/light-headed, had a numb arm, and began sweating. Patient was brought back to the pharmacy, where a machine took his BP as 207/107 with a pulse of 114. Patient stated he felt &#34;like his heart was trying to get out of his chest&#34;. Patient had no significant medical history, and in fact had not had a vaccine in over a decade. Pharmacist directed patient and their family to the hospital/doctor due to hypertensive crisis BP, but suspected it was due to nerves/anxiety.

                                                Saturday: Intense chills, and body aches, that were unmanageable through 1,000mg Tylenol every 4-6hours and Gabapentin 1,200mg every 6 hours.   At approximately 2:30 AM on 4/11/2021 I awoke to extreme chills and uncontrollable tremors. The tremors were so bad that I had issues walking to the kitchen to take additional medication, and could not hold a glass in my right hand steady - as it slipped out of my hand while my hand was uncontrollably shaking. Additional Tylenol, Gabapentin, and Zanaflex calmed my nerves enough to where I was able to return to manageable chills for the next 12 hours.

                                                Patient had vaso-vagal reaction from the vaccine. Within 2 minutes of getting the vaccine the patient became flushed and very pale. He as sweating profusely and had vision loss. He was sitting while this all happened which I think prevented him from fainting. I got him water, an ice pack and called ems. By the time EMS arrived the patient was starting to feel better. EMS did their evaluation on site and the patient was able to go home 20 minutes later.

                                                During my first vaccine I experienced a bruise on my arm that lasted ~3 weeks. My arm swelled (including my fingers which looked like sausages) for a few hours that night.  I also felt like I experienced slight chest congestion for a week or two after. The second vaccine (lot number listed on this form) I have a bruise that in my opinion is worse than the one from the first shot.  The bruise is still present after 1 week. I also feel slight tenderness around the joint area. I have not heard of these symptoms being advertise Will this cause joint damage? Additionally form both vaccines I experienced fever, body aches and obviously a sore arm.

Patient finished with injection and walked into the observation room. Observation provider FNP walked up to patient after he had sat down and the patient appeared to have a seizure for approx 90 seconds, was leaning to the side where provider was supporting him, and was unresponsive. Provider called for help and this provider &amp;  FNP responded. Patient was awake and looking at us but was not responding to questions. Patient was assisted fully to a wheel chair and moved to a private room. Vitals were obtained - oxygen saturations were low and patient began to look dusky and cyanotic around lips. AGNP, FNP, and Dr also arrived.  Oxygen was applied. Blood pressure was in the 60s systolic and 30&#39;s diastolic.  Patient started to pink up after oxygen was given. Patient&#39;s phone had an active call (girlfriend). She was unable to provide any history for the patient.  Patient started answering questions slowly.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine  About 8 hours after receiving the second dose of Moderna, almost all of the side effects came in full force including headache, dizziness, fatigue, full body aches, injection site pain, chills, and elevated temperature. The peak severity lasted about 4-5 hours. It wasn&#39;t possible to sleep at all the night after the shot. After that 5 hour period, lingering side effects included headache, fatigue, and aches. About 22 hours after the shot, I decided to take some Tylenol to help get rid of the residual side effects. At 24 hours after the shot, it appears most effects have subsided but there is residual dizziness and some fatigue and weakness.

By next day, expected flu-like symptoms were apparent such as chills, headache, and body aches. Then, full body muscle twitches and motor tics began. The continue six weeks later. On the 7th day post-vaccine, early AM sleep paralysis/seizure sensation 4-5 times before falling back asleep. When awoken, unilateral weakness (right side). Right eye vision blurry. Right ear muffled. Subjective weakness and numbness in right arm and leg. Went to ER and was admitted under suspicion of TIA or mild stroke. CT w/oC appeared unremarkable. Scheduled for a brain MRI following day (3/19) WWO contrast. Appeared unremarkable, so acute ischaemia was ruled out. Blood work was done repeatedly during stay (CBC, metabolic, CRP, sed rate, urinalysis). Everything was unremarkable. Discharged with instruction to follow-up if symptoms did not improve. The unilateral weakness is intermittent six weeks later. On 4/20, allergist tested against components of Moderna vaccine intradermally. This showed a reaction compared to the negative control. Allergist advised to avoid further vaccination with any of the ingredients in Moderna. Allergist posited that symptoms could be a latent reaction to the allergy, but wasn&#39;t sure as prolonged presentation seems unlikely. Future follow-ups: rheumatologist to rule out acute autoimmune reaction, 4/21/21. Neurologist second opinion 5/4/21. Primary care evaluation, as PCP was on leave for several months, 5/19/21.

                                                Patient has history of passing out when getting blood drawn. As patient was standing to get vaccination card filled out, he told associate to call RPH that he wasn&#39;t feeling well. I ran out to give my attention and patient was sweating and looked dizzy. His eyes started to shut while he was standing and as I was holding his arm and back to support him he started to fall to the ground. Patient gently went to the ground, I pushed him over to one side and he was out for about 3 seconds and woke back up. Patient was very hot and sweaty. He wanted to move to a more private area so I made an area with a privacy panel available to him. Patient stated to me that he has no history of seizure, but suffers from mild anxiety. Myself or one of the associates was with him for approximately 45 minutes just to make sure he was ok. His blood pressure was taken (twice) and water was given. His BP readings were normal. Patient was on his way. Moderna series completed.

                                                Patient called out reporting that he had fainted/blacked out while sitting in chair across from the pharmacy counter. The patient was sitting with legs were stretched out and his head was laying back on a shelf that was immediately behind the chair he was in.  I immediately went out to converse with the patient. I called for someone to bring him a cool drink and gave him a cool compress for his forehead. He pulled his mask down below is nose to breathe more freely. While he was drinking the pineapple drink I asked if this had ever happened before while receiving a vaccine or during a blood draw. He said never as an adult but as a child he did have fainting spells. When asked if he had eaten at all during the morning or afternoon he reported he had not but had only drank water and coffee. After about 10-15 minutes he started to feel better. I asked if I could call someone to drive him home, he said he was fine and when he went to get up to go he reported that his arms were tingling. I asked his permission to call 911 so he could be evaluated in the ER. He agreed. 911 was dispatched. Paramedics took his blood pressure and found his diastolic pressure to be 100. He was asked if he had been diagnosed with HTN or if he was taking any medications to treat it. He denied. They suggested that he be taken to the ER to which he declined to go. The paramedics escorted him out of the store at approximately 2:15pm.

                                                I first noticed I was itchy on the evening of 5/11 and noticed hives on my body the next morning. They continued to get worse for several days and appeared on all parts of my body from head to toe. I noticed my feet hurt and that I was showing signs of angioedema beginning on 5/14 and peaking the next day. I also experienced joint/tendon pain in the evening of 5/16 between my legs and feet (upper ankle). I still have hives today. The hives were particularly bad in high-touch areas, near the armpits, lower arms, pelvis areas. I took Benadryl occasionally which helped but at no point did the hives go away.

                                                Starting at about 5pm on the day of vaccination, I experienced intense but expected side effects including full body muscle ache, fever, drowsiness, cold sweats, joint pain. These symptoms lasted for about 24hrs before subsiding completely by that Tuesday evening. On Thursday, 5/13, I woke up with moderate tightness in my chest that progressed over the course of 45 minutes to be severe chest pain. At that point, my wife drove me to the ER in  where I was checked in at about 8:30am. By the time I was checked in the chest pain had subsided to be just a slight discomfort, overall the chest pain had lasted for approximately 2 hours. At the ER my bloodwork was done and the initial blood samples returned an elevated Troponin I level of 5.04 ng/ml. While at the ER at the  I experienced one more incident of chest pain which lasted roughly 30 minutes and was moderately low on the pain scale. I was given multiple EKGs, X-rays, and Echocardiograms, all of which showed no abnormalities. Repeated troponin tests however showed an increase in my levels over the course of the day from 5 up to 12.6 and 13. I was placed on a heparin drip in the afternoon. By doctor recommendation I was air-lifted to later that night at 10:30pm so that further scans and a possible cardiac catheterization and CT scans. The following day, Friday, at 1am at my bloodwork was taken and troponin levels had increased to 14. I was scheduled for a CT scan, cardiac MRI, and echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis of Myocarditis. By Saturday afternoon I was taken off of the heparin drip and told that they would not be able to perform any of the scheduled tests until Monday at the earliest. My most recent troponin level came back as a 9. At this point I decided to check myself out of  against medical advice since they were not able to run the necessary scans and my wife and I do not live in . I returned home to and followed up on 5/19 with a doctor at the ER at  since I was unable to find any available appointments with any cardiologists in the area for the next few weeks. My troponin levels and EKG taken at came back as normal, so I continue to follow doctor advice of bedrest and no alcohol for the next 4-6 weeks. My pulse is still elevated (roughly 85 bpm resting when it used to be at &lt;65 bpm resting) and seems to easily increase with even moderate activity such as walking in the house up to over 100 bpm.

                                                The same day as the injection I experienced severe pain a few hours after in my bicep rather than my shoulder where I experienced pain during the 1st vaccine dose. I also experienced the common fatigue. However, at 12:13a.m on May 25th, I was woken from sleeping to what can only be described as either the most severe case of the shakes that have ever been experienced, or convulsions. I was unable to move, speak, and could hardly breathe. The effects of this lasted well over an hour and a half. It was only after what I was experiencing stopped, that I suddenly became burning hot, but did not have a fever. 98.7° was what was read at the time I started to feel hot. Since then I have experienced severe joint and knuckle pain on my left hand, still bicep soreness, pain in my left forearm, again joint and knuckle pain in my left hand, and headaches.

                                                Friday (Day of shot): Fairly typical symptoms (soreness in arm, cough and sore throat, headache, and fatigue) Saturday (24hrs): Same symptoms as above, but slightly worse than day before. In addition, both feet (on top) began itching later into day. Sunday (48 hrs):  Typical symptoms began disappearing, itch on feet became more intense, bottoms of feet and ankles started to itch as well. Monday (72 hours): Typical symptoms virtually disappeared. Itching became progressively worse throughout the day on feet/ankles, and various small areas of body (abdomin, back of knees, inside of elbows/forearms) became itchy. Hives and rashes noticed over entire body later in afternoon. Hives/rashes were either single (unraised) isolated red dots, clustered and raised red patches, or clusters of small &#34;braille-like&#34; bumps (clusters and bumps area-size ranged anywhere from quarter-sized to palm-sized). Most noticeable areas were upper left back/shoulder, both sides of abdomin, groin, front/inner thighs, behind both knees, inner forearms, and both ankles and feet (top and bottom). Sore throat also came back on Monday afternoon, and over ~2 hr became itchy, then constricted with trouble swallowing, then restricted/strained breathing. Went to ER after noticed trouble swallowing, given epinehrine shot in  left leg. Throat slowly went back to normal over the next 1-2 hours. From 05/18 through today (3 weeks, and still ongoing),  rashes and hives have been diminished in size and amount, but are present both in pre-existing and new areas of body. Rashes/hives may last 1-2 days after developing or be on-going (feet and ankles). No prior history of allergies. No change in diet, lifestyle, soaps/detergents, environment at time of reaction.

No side effects were noted following 1st dose (one month prior to 2nd dose).  Severe skin reaction primarily concentrated at both palms (redness, irritation, minor painfulness) and both feet (irritation, visible rash). Skin reactions also occurred on upper chest and full back (redness, itchiness). Reactions are still present but have begun to subside about 120 hours after injection.

                                                From May 14, 2021, I have started experience dizziness and weakness in my body. There has been slight fever during the initial days but the weakness and mild headache is still there till today i.e. June 9 2021. I do experience a little shortness of breath and chest pain (on both sides) sometimes but that is not continuous and remains normal most of the time. I have got stomach infection and constipation too during these times and I have taken a pill of Prilosec upon prescription of doctor. Stomach looks good and bowel movement is fine as of now. I have been monitoring my blood pressure and body temp during these days and they all were normal.    Apart from that I experience chills more than anyone around me and don&#39;t know if that is related to vaccine effect.  Currently, my main concerns are - mild headache, weakness in body and dizziness which is happening for almost a month now.

                                                About 2-5 minutes after receiving shot I felt a twitch/bubbling feeling in the left side of my face. I immediately started getting anxiety and my hands began to sweat. I also started getting a mild pain in my lower spine. Which is still persisting today (2 days later). Yesterday I was pretty tire and had aches all day that came and went. It was very hard to work from home but I managed to work 6 hours with breaks. Also yesterday and this morning when I got out of the shower I noticed 2-3 itchy red bumps on my stomach area. I?m not sure if I had a mild allergic reaction to the vaccine. Either way, I will most likely contact my doctor before I get my second dose. I hear the second dose is more intense which makes me hesitant as the first dose debilitated me quite a bit.  I am usually very healthy and have never had any allergic reactions which makes this puzzling. The only thing that comes to mind that may have caused this is mushroom immune supplement. Any info will be much appreciated, thanks.

Treatment: Took the day after the shot off of work and slept a LOT (approx 18 hours on and off), stayed hydrated and fed. Did not take painkillers due to hearing it would interfere with vaccine uptake. Most symptoms except for headache had gone away by 30-hour mark. Only some lingering fatigue and achiness left over past 36-hour mark.

I woke up in the middle of the night (around 12:00AM) with terrible night sweats, chills, a fever of 101, a terrible headache (completely different from my migraines) and my arm was extremely sore and painful. I tried to avoid taking any medication as I heard that it could decrease the efficacy of the vaccine, but it became unbearable so I took ibuprofen around 3:00am. My symptoms lasted throughout the next day, the fever subsided after the first dose of ibuprofen however I still had chills and the headache. The chills finally subsided around 3:00pm and the headache did not subside until I woke up Friday (2/5/21) morning around 6:00am which was roughly 42 hours after my second dose was administered.

These began around 1AM approximately 9 hours after vaccination.  Side effects most strongly felt within 36 hours of receiving vaccination.  Continued fatigue, chills, night sweats and muscle pain for two additional days (Thursday 3/11, Friday 3/12) that gradually subsided over those days. Appeared to be a slight rash around the injection site for several days after. I previously had the COVID-19 virus in late March 2020.

One week later (Thursday, 3/18/21), sore arm and slight muscle/joint pain came back and has subsided. Friday evening I experienced left jaw and ear pain and has subsided. Saturday morning, small bumps/rash appeared on left forearm (vaccine in left shoulder). Saturday evening, same thing on right forearm. Bumps/rash are similar to blisters and some have pustules. Itchy and painful. Took Benadryl. Sunday morning, more on hands, feet, and ankles. Continued Benadryl and monitoring. Sunday evening, increased density of sites on hands, feet, and ankles. Some showing on lower legs and knees. Monday morning (now), itchiness and pain increased. Increased Benadryl intake. This has helped reduce itchiness slightly. Sites are still painful. Hands feel slightly swollen/tight where sites are.

                                                Around 2:00am of the day of the adverse event i started to feel &#34;off&#34; so i continued to try to go to sleep when i started sweating from my upper body at the same time my heart rate increased fast, at that point it was hard for me to even move my body without making my heart go faster. My girlfriend was treating me during the event helping me taking my shirt off because i got desperate from the heat and cold at the same time i drenched my side of the bed and speaking incoherently at times, i asked my girlfriend to bring me my phone in case &#34;i needed to call 911&#34; but in the process i fell asleep while my girlfriend was watching me until 6:00am i finally slept, since that day i have been feeling better but not 100% i still have some sort of muscle spasms in ramdom areas of my body but more on my left upper arm

Specifically my right foot, usually the ball of the foot by my big toe.   I woke up this morning with the most painful flareup I can recall. On a scale of 1-10, the pain was a 7-8. After taking two Aleve tablets and icing my foot twice the pain is a 3-4. The joint still feels swollen and the range of motion is diminished.

He did drink some water and felt better. He thought he may have been dehydrated , anxious about the shot, and concerned when reading the shot info.  He has had flu shots in the past but  has not been  to a doctor in recent memory. The paramedics checked him and offered him a ride to the hospital . His vitals were fine so they released him to his girlfriend who was able to drive.

Patient&#39;s head went back as if he was falling asleep, but  he began making gurgling noises and his eyes rolled to the back of his head.  Helped him slide him down out of the chair, so he would not hit his head or fall.  Once on the floor the patient began seizing. After a sternum rub, the patient raised up and was helped back into the chair.  He was sweating  and flushed.  He was able to answer questions as we awaited the EMT to arrive.

According to wife he did shake for less than 15 seconds in his arm and a bit in his head.  They were in the car, so she tilted the seat back for him and came in to get us.  Within the 30 seconds that she was gone he was awake and sweating profusely.  We gave him an ice pack, 25mg of liquid benadryl, and kept him laying back in the seat.  At 5 and 15 minutes mark the patient was checked on and he was completely fine.  After 20 minutes the patient had stopped sweating and reported to be feeling 98% better.

Once pharmacist came out to check on patient, he was conscious and responsive, but seemed confused. 911 was called. Patient got up from chair and tried to leave the store. We told him to stay seated. It was apparent that the patient defecated in the chair, so he walked to the bathroom. Pharmacy staff stayed with the patient until EMS arrived on scene. Patient refused to go with EMS.

                                                patient received first dose of MODERNA. As soon as the immunization was complete, he started feeling faint. I called a pharmacy technician into the room with me, and got him a water. He slumped in the chair, fainted, as his head fell back  he made a groaning noise, eyes rolled. I went into get the radio to call code white and when I returned he had come to, and was asking to lay on the floor. He was sweating and clammy. The optical manager, helped me and pharmacy technician get him to the floor. He did not want an ambulance because he was starting to feel better. After 15 minutes of water and cold pack on his neck, he was recovered. He was talking and up walking. He left with his brother and brother&#39;s girlfriend.

                                                The day after, I had the normal fever, flu-like symptoms, and my left ankle/right knee ached pretty badly. Starting Monday 05/17, my right knee was unbearably painful. If I moved it at all away from a ~30 degree angle, my entire leg lit up with the worst pain I&#39;ve ever felt. Not as bad as if I put pressure on it though, that was even worse. I couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t drive, could barely get out of bed for days. I got through that with over the counter pain killers and Biofreezing the knee like crazy.  Starting Friday 05/21 I believe, my knee pain suddenly went away only to be replaced with pain in my left foot. It&#39;s not nearly as bad as the knee was, but the entire left side is in constant pain made worse with pressure. I can drive now that my right leg works fine, but still can&#39;t walk without some form of assistance. I was reporting all of this in the V-safe health checker, but it apparently doesn&#39;t care outside of 7 days. Tempted to put &#34;permanent damage&#34; for Item 21 as the result, but I&#39;m hoping this goes away soon.

                                                Approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, patient reported feeling clammy and light-headed. I provided cold compresses and water. Patient remained sitting in his chair and after about 5-10 minutes he reported feeling closer to normal. His father was accompanying him so they remained in our booth for about 20 minutes longer and he reported that he was feeling 98%.

                                                Just after midnight, I was watching TV with my brother after smoking a medical pre-roll (I&#39;m a medical marijuana patient). Shortly after, I began feeling dizzy. I finished my glass of water and the dizziness subsided for roughly ten minutes, before returning even worse than before.  I went to get more water and after filling my glass and closing the refrigerator, I was barely able to walk the few steps from my kitchen to the living room to lie down on the couch.  At this time, my chest started feeling tight, and I had a light tingling sensation in my feet and lower body.  When I closed my eyes, the dizziness got worse, and laying in certain positions made the tightness in my upper chest become painful. I continued to drink water and ate a little, but the episode lasted between 30-60 minutes of mild discomfort ranging to a decent amount of pain. There was a moment when I had considered going to the hospital, but after eating, drinking, and doing some controlled breathing, the pain lessened I ended up falling asleep on the couch.  I woke up feeling considerably better, but decided to call out of work so I wouldn&#39;t do any strenuous activity. On occassion I still feel like there&#39;s a little bit of pressure or tightness in my upper chest,  but nothing painful or debilitating like the night of the incident

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    In April 2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 17-May-2021, the patient experienced VOMITING (vomiting). On an unknown date, the patient experienced BELL&#39;S PALSY (might have what looked like bells palsy on one side of his face) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (second dose appointment was scheduled for 15May2021 which he missed), NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDER (neurologic spasm up and down his spine), MUSCLE RIGIDITY (serious rigid back in the middle of his back) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes along his neck/ has swollen lymph nodes). The patient was treated with CANNABIS at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, BELL&#39;S PALSY (might have what looked like bells palsy on one side of his face), PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (second dose appointment was scheduled for 15May2021 which he missed), NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDER (neurologic spasm up and down his spine), MUSCLE RIGIDITY (serious rigid back in the middle of his back) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes along his neck/ has swollen lymph nodes) outcome was unknown and VOMITING (vomiting) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 05-May-2021, Olfactory test: negative (normal) negative but it was 24 hour test.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications reported. Treatment medication not reported.  This case concerns a 28-year-old male patient who received first dose of mRNA-1273 and missed second dose (missed dose.  The patient experienced additional events after first dose for which based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. vomiting is consistent with known safety profile of the vaccine.

                                                Injection arm became very sore at around 1 PM, around four hours after the injection of dose two. Around 6 PM, began noticing overall body soreness and fatigue. A headache began soon after, and remained throughout the night. I barely slept because my arm and shoulder hurt so bad, and I also was sweating and shivering. I woke up many times.   At 8am on 06/24 I woke up with a severe headache and nausea. My injection arm and shoulder was very sore. My body overall ached, joints and muscles. I almost called into work but decided to go.   I took 500mg of acetaminophen at 10:25am.  At 10:30am at work, I was still very sore and noticed I was mildly disoriented. My coworkers commented on my look of fatigue.  Around 1pm, my disorientation and fatigue began to alleviate somewhat, and my headache had resolved by that time.  Currently it is 8:51pm. I worked the whole day at work, though it was difficult with the body aches and exhaustion. I have a mild headache, general fatigue and soreness, and my  injection arm is still very sore.

Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

I pretty much slept all day and all night (2/4) on 2/5, I was feeling a lot better, no fever, but still felt weak. pretty much relaxed all day and slept. the next 2 days I just took it easy and relaxed. Didn&#39;t take any medications during this.

                                                During the first day after taking vaccine, started having a fever, headache, and sore throat. By the evening, fever was severe and 102&#43;, with severe headache and sore throat. After sleeping on that nigh (had disruption of sleep from 2 - 4 in the morning), it was looking normal., just had usual fatigue after a fever. But on Thursday (Took vaccine on Tuesday morning, March 02, 2021), I suddenly started having a seizure, my whole body was shaking, legs were cramping. I thought it was going to go away, but after 10 minutes it was getting worse and I had to call the emergency services. The fire service members first came, they measured my blood oxygen level, it was 98%, but my blood pressure was high (140). I was still shaking and having the seizure. They tried to calm me down by talking, after some time, my blood pressure came to normal and I started getting normal (no seizure at that point). I declined the ambulance service as it is expensive and I was getting normal. I had a 101 fever just after that and went to visit the health care facilities .

                                                This patient felt fine with the injection and for the 15 min following. He was dismissed to check out and make a follow up appt. While waiting in line to make his appt, he stated to his mother (who had given him a ride and stayed with him) that he felt faint. His mother shouted to staff nearby that he was going to pass out, so a staff person grabbed a chair for him. He sat in the chair, but did not fully lose consciousness. I ran to him with , told someone to get an ice pack, and asked his mother to sit in a chair next to him and place her hand on his right arm. I checked his bp at this time and it was 58/30. He was shaking all over, diaphoretic, pale,  and his muscles were weak.  He asked for water, so one was given to him, and he promptly drank the whole 16 oz bottle.  Over approximately 5 min, he came back to his normal LOC, stopped shaking and sweating, and stated that he was feeling better.  He was given a small bag of crackers and another bottle of water, which he quickly consumed before standing up. At this point, he stated that he was feeling hung over after staying out late the evening before drinking and celebrating St. Patrick&#39;s Day. Instructed him to make sure he is well hydrated before he comes for his second dose vaccination.

                                                Patient received 1st dose of Moderna at approximately 12:30pm on 3/18/21. He did not stay the recommended 15 minutes on site for observation. He drove himself back to vaccination clinic parking lot at approximately 1:40pm and got out of his car hurriedly to get his mask from the trunk before speaking with EMS on site. He then reported to EMS his wife witnessed him have a seizure (eyes rolled back, unresponsive, stiffening of arms and legs) for 2-3 min approximately 1 hour after receiving his shot. He reported when he regained responsiveness he asked his wife what had happened as he reportedly had no recollection of the seizure, they decided to call the patient&#39;s sister and she directed them to return to site of vaccination to report his seizure.  EMS who evaluated patient reported he denied (and was not exhibiting) postictal signs/symptoms when he arrived back in parking lot at vaccination site. He denied having a history of seizures or any medical conditions. EMS also reported that neither the patient nor his wife called 911 after the seizure. Patient declined any further medical evaluation/follow up. EMS urged him to call 911 if he had anymore seizure activity to which he replied he thought if he just rested Friday and through the weekend, he&#39;d be fine to return to work on Monday.

Patient came in today around 1 pm stating he was sore and couldn&#39;t sleep last night and today he has limited movement in left arm. He can lift it up to almost horizontal position forward but difficulty moving it backwards. He took 2 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen as directed and still sore. Advised he can take 4 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen (800 mg) every 8 hours for a day and see if that relieves pain and motion. He can also put a cold compress to affected area for slight swelling. If not better in a day or so advised him to contact a doctor, because might need something stronger to treat reaction to vaccine.

The hospital was of no remedy to me. One doctor even boldly claimed that she wasn?t there so they can?t necessarily say I had a seizure. I received no medications and left the hospital with no CT scan.

                                                About a week (6 days) after I had my first Moderna shot, Inflammation of the hands and fingers started in the forms or red/skin color welts like Hives. Excessive burning and itching sensations, difficult even to wash or rub hands together, scratching was increasing the pain and was resulting in swelling of fingers. Fingertips had pain gotten super sensitive with inflammation.  Couldn&#39;t even form my fist because of swelling and pain. Had a lot of discomfort and difficulty sleeping so took a Tylenol PM one night to reduce the inflammation and to aid the sleep. Only took it once as not much of a fan of medicines. I also soaked my hands in water with baking soda which provided some comfort and reduced the pain and inflammation, applied some coconut oil to soothe the inflammation.  As I thought it was happening because of hives and/or excessive heat increase in the body, I changed my diets, started with foods and ingredients that cools down the body which felt like working and the swelling, pain, burning/itching sensations were slowly pacifying in 3-4 days. I also got acupuncture treatment after 5 days which has helped a lot now. Now after a week and all that I did, I don&#39;t feel the pain and burning sensations anymore, no swelling and the skin is getting clear, red spots/welts are disappearing and I am able to sleep better.

I asked patient if he felt ok to move to observation area. patient said yes and stood up and walked to observation area. he sat down and I told him I would be right back. I turned around and was walking back into the pharmacy when I heard a loud crash. I turned around and patient was slumped side ways about to fall out of chair. He had fainted or had a seizure (he was very stiff, redness to face, eyes open and fixed). I ran over to him and a pharm tech and I got him to the floor immediately. He regained consciousness within 5-10 seconds after placing him on floor. he asked how long was he out. he stated he had this seizure happen before but never after a vaccine. he said he has had multiple vaccines like hepatitis b and this never happened. he states it happens when he has something done to him that causes intense pain. he said it happened after hurting his ankle or when he hit his hand in a fan. checked his BP-172/100 pulse-65.  paramedics came to check him out. BP still elevated. he walked out with paramedics.

Patient consented to Janssen as his first COVID vaccine on 03/31/2021. It is possible he received Moderna vaccine instead because both types of vaccine were being prepared/administered at nearby stations. Patient notified of possible error.  Mild arm soreness for 1 day. No adverse events as of 04/08/2021 after following up with patient via telephone.  informed and advised for patient to receive 2nd Moderna vaccine 28-42 days after initial vaccine due to our uncertainty as to which vaccine he received on 03/31/2021.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Friday around 2:45pm. Felt zero symptoms beside soreness at the injection site, until about 10pm, when I became extremely overheated quite suddenly. I was trying to exit the building to get into cold air when I fainted twice. I was unconscious for 5 seconds or fewer each time. I did not hit my head or sustain any injury from the falls.  Paramedics arrived about 10 minutes later, by which time I had regained consciousness and felt fine aside from weakness, dehydration, and some temperature fluctuation. They said my vitals were perfect and I went home from there. I was feeling completely fine and back to normal by 6pm the next day.

The vaccine was administered in my left arm. I cannot go back to sleep until I straighten my arm out and support it with my body by laying on my right side. During the day there is slight tenderness to the elbow joint, but otherwise no pain or symptoms. As of 4/12 it now feels like I have partially torn my Achilles&#39; tendon where it connects to the bottom of my heel in my left foot after trying to lightly stretch it while standing talking to someone in my office. I am fairly active outdoors and consider myself in otherwise good health so these two events post-vaccine seem very odd to me.

                                                Noticed hives about an hour after getting the shot forming all around my body.  Thought it was normal as the covid rash.  Quickly started feeling ill. Had a small amount of trouble breathing and a fever with swelling  and the hives became larger as my skin was flushed. Googled it and it said that this was a normal reaction and common side effects.  So I did not do anything and fell asleep because I felt badly. The next day I woke up to see the bumps all over my body including my digits and pelvic region. Called and talked to my wife she told me to go to the hospital. I started feeling a bit better though and decided against it and took rest that day. The following day the rash had become raised and tender across my body.

                                                This is a secondary VAERS for the same pt. Pt originally was very anxious before the vaccine, got the vaccine and subsequently had lightheadedness and nausea. He was treated for this by laying him down which resolved his sx&#39;s almost immediately. Vitals were all normal. He denies CP, SOB, nausea resolved and so did his lightheadedness. About 6 hours after the vaccine, pt was seen in the ER for a seizure. Pt has a hx of a brain tumor with surgical removal. No sz since March 2020, per pt. He was treated for a sz and for sinusitis.

The next day he was sitting watching TV and felt very weak, had a weak pulse and tried to measure it but did not give a good reading 60/40, felt like he was going to pass out and was sweating and had to lie down.  This happened twice within 10 minutes of each other.  He laid down and breathed carefully and calmed himself down to get through it, and that lasted for 1-2 minutes.  He has had no other reactions since.

Fever was noticed the morning after receiving the vaccination and led to a much earlier wake-up than usual. Fever was roughly 100 degrees F. Patient took 1g acetaminophen to address headache, which is typical as patient takes NSAIDs regularly to address headache. Fever went down to 98.5 within a few hours, returned to 99.5 by afternoon.

About 5 minutes into waiting outside the pharmacy sitting in a chair I heard a loud thud outside the clinical services room. I was alerted by pharmacy technician that the patient had fainted. We called 9-1-1 immediately. Patient was face down and unconscious for about 7-10 minutes. Patient also had some convulsions during this period. Patient regained consciousness but was very disoriented and did not know where he was. He then went in and out of consciousness for about another 7-10 minutes until EMTs arrived and began caring for patient.

I administered the patient with his second shot of the moderna, then he sat on the chair in the waiting area after his vaccine. I then gave his fiancé her 2nd shot of the moderna. As I was done giving the shot, his fiancé and I noticed his eyes are rolling backwards and he started to faint in the chair.  Then his wife and I tried to waking him. He regained conscience after 20 seconds or more. He was extremely hot so I got him a water.  I had him wait 10 minutes after so I can monitor him.

Within 24 hours of the vaccine my tounge went numb, although I couldn&#39;t taste on my tounge I can in the rest of my mouth. I also started to feel heavy fatigue, headaches and chills. These symptoms continued into the next day (22nd) with the addition of jaw tightness and ear pain. The fatigue and headache went away at the end of the day on the 22nd. When I woke up on the 23rd half my face was numb and I am unable to smile correctly, movement of my eye brows has been impared and the use of my right eyelid, as it is not able to close completely. My tounge is still numb, the persistent use of which causes muscle tightness. Yawns and other large movements of my jaw can cause the muscle under the tounge to freeze up which is painful. went to urgent care as soon as I could and was told this could be a rare side effect but they told me based on my symptoms I have bell palsy. I was prescribed acyclovir, lorazepam, and prednisone.

                                                The first day after I received the vaccine I experienced symptoms in guidance with all available resources. I was fatigued, my arm was sore at the sight of injection. I remember sleeping at least 12 hours.  A few days later I began to experience severe intermittent chest pain. The area under my arm was extremely tender, as were the area behind my left knee. The adverse event as stated in the report was a sudden jolt of searing pain on my left side. It lasted only a few moments and felt like it traveled from my left shoulder down to my left thigh and behind my knee. It nearly knocked me off my feet. I remained with a lingering pain in my leg and upper left back until today.  I reached out the pharmacist  who administered the vaccine about the side effects and she advised me to immediately contact my doctor&#39;s office. I visited my doctor&#39;s office yesterday (6/3/21) and he assured me I didn&#39;t have any blood clots. He advised me to use a heating pad for the pain in my leg. He also said that sometimes the lingering side effects from the vaccine may last weeks in rare cases. Those discomforts are finally starting to subside. I had no treatment outside of elevated levels of hydration, taking Tylenol and resting.

                                                Acute localized lower back pain along with localized lower abdominal pain. Difficult to explain sensations, almost like a catch in lower-mid spine, along with abdominal pain in relatively the same area.   Feels like someone kicked me square in the middle of the spine. Possibly kidney pain? Tends to come in intense waves of pain, with a lingering dull ache seperating the more intense spasms.   The abdominal pain reminds me of a bowel obstruction I had a while back, almost like someone has taken a section of my intestines with both hands and is violently stretching it apart. No diahrrea, or constipation - as far as I can tell.  Lying down or propping and supporting the back does nothing to help with the back pain. Neither does any OTC pain relievers such as Acetaminophen or Naproxen, and as a result sleep is very difficult.

The body aches, headache, and arm pain lasted until 06/06/2021. The swollen eyes are still swollen today, 06/10/21, 7 days after the vaccine. On 06/09/2021 my lymph nodes in my right arm pit and on my left pectoral muscle swelled up, became red, and had an aching pain without touch and a moderate pain when touched. As of today, 06/10/2021, my lymph nodes are still swollen but with very minor pain with touch.

                                                I got the 2nd dose on 06/06/2021 and then for a couple days after my heart was pounding and I was just tired. I felt tightening in my chest, intermittent pain in upper back. Periodically this would come in waves. My hands felt like pins and needles kind of flushed over my body. It was mainly hands and feet but I would feel it in my face and sometimes arms and legs. I did go to the ER about a week after 2nd dose (around 06/13/2021). They told me it could&#39;ve been anxiety and stress. They did an EKG, blood work, and x-ray and didn&#39;t find anything abnormal. I did f/u with PCP and I just went last week and explained symptoms there as well and they&#39;re looking into my issues. They told me today I had a high white blood cell count and that my liver has elevated enzymes. They want me to come in the middle of July to do more fasting blood work. No fever, no malaise, but I did feel tired and fatigued and nauseous. I had bad brain fog and my body felt like it wasn&#39;t mine. It was like someone took my brain and put inside someone else&#39;s body. 1 week after 2nd dose I had bad sinus pressure behind eyes like my eyes were going to burst out of skull.

                                                A couple of days after the vaccine, my lymph nodes in armpits were swollen and neck lymph nodes were swollen for a couple days. It was uncomfortable nut not painful. No fever, no malaise. I did feel nauseous during this time. 2 weeks after my vaccine (around 05/22/2021) I had a weird sensation that my left arm went numb and I couldn&#39;t really control it 100%. I went to the ER because I thought I was having a stroke and because of my experience with Bells Palsy. They didn&#39;t do anything because I was in the lobby waiting for 2-3 hours and they seemed rushed and they told me that I must&#39;ve been sitting in weird position because my arm went numb. They didn&#39;t do any tests.

Over the next day or two I began to notice persistent weakness of the 4th and 5th digits on my left hand to abduction, adduction, flexion, and extension.  Over the weekend the weakness improved slightly, but has not improved much in the past few days.  I am also still occasionally experiencing the tingling sensation in the same distribution.

He was able to cushion his fall so that he did not have any broken bones, bleeding etc.  He said he felt weak and tired.  I had to help him up from the floor.  He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

                                                I&#39;ve prior had mild adverse reactions to flu shots where I&#39;d feel slightly ill for a day or so afterwards, but no significant responses to question the initial COVID vaccine. About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

I went to bed at 9:30pm and woke up at 2:00am unable to move my left arm due to severe pain, a pounding headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and minor nasal congestion. I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep the remainder of the night due to the pain. All symptoms persisted the morning and afternoon of the 21st as well. The severe arm pain subsided but I still struggled to lift my arm past 90 degrees without intense pain. I went to bed on the 21st unable to rest on my left shoulder due to the pain and woke up the 22nd with most symptoms gone except for a minor headache and moderate soreness in the left arm.

                                                Chills starting around 10:30 PM, joined shortly after by an increasingly painful headache. Alternating between chills and being overheated on and off all night, while headache became worse. Had to take ibuprofen at 7:30 AM after not being able to sleep, and was able to sleep. Woke up at 1 PM and had to take another ibuprofen for the headache. Chills were gone, but was overheated and sweating for an hour or two. Had to take another ibuprofen at night, but headache wasn&#39;t too much worse. Headaches were gone upon waking up at 9 AM on Sunday.  Experienced lymph node swelling in armpit of arm that got the vaccination. Tried to do pushups, but became too painful. I had also experienced the lymph node swelling after my first vaccination 28 days before my second one. About a week after, and they always felt minorly swollen up until the time of my second vaccination. I didn&#39;t know they were caused by the vaccine until after the second vaccination.  Currently 1:20 AM on Monday, and I have been experiencing redness and itching in a large patch around the vaccination site all day.

Next day I was in bed all day the next day because of the severe body aches. Cough got worse for the next few days or so after that.  I had some shortness of breath because of the coughing. Migraines started - strong headaches. The first one was the morning after the vaccine. During the next day (third day after vaccine) I had another migraine.  Symptoms were acute for three days.

I took tylenol to try to help reduce the fever, which it did not help.  during the middle of the night I was woke up with an urge to vomit.  I ended up vomiting multiple times throughout the day and had a debilitating migraine.  after 26 hours since the shot was given I would finally be able to function as the migraine started to subside as well as the nausea.  My arm was also quite sore for about 4 days after the shot.

                                                That evening I began to have a fever and chills.  I took tylenol to try to help reduce the fever, which it did not help.  during the middle of the night I was woke up with an urge to vomit.  I ended up vomiting multiple times throughout the day and had a debilitating migraine.  after 26 hours since the shot was given I would finally be able to function as the migraine started to subside as well as the nausea.   My arm was also quite sore for about 4 days after the shot.

                                                Patient lives with family in private residence with parents and 2 siblings. Spends most of time in own room. First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

                                                After I was administered the shot. I was directed to a space designated for observation for patients after they receive the  vaccine. Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

I took a melatonin to boost this effect, and was cozily asleep by 6 PM, T&#43;3. 5:00 AM, T&#43;14: woke up chilly and overall mildly sore. Normal temperature. Very mild headache behind the eyes. No Tylenol yet for anything. Chills compounded by the fact I was  wearing the same T-shirt from the day. I changed into a long-sleeve pajama turtleneck, pull-over sweater, and put on socks, and went back to sleep.  7 AM, T&#43;16: Soreness and chills fading. Arm still a bit sore but less than shot #1. 8 AM, T&#43;17: Headache and soreness comparable to a rough hangover. Moving slow today. No Tylenol needed yet. 11:30 AM: Mild fever of 100.7. Headache and soreness have remained mild. 2:30 PM (T&#43;23.5): Fever of 101.0 (peak) 6:30 PM (T&#43;27.5): Fever reduced to 99.5. 8:00 PM (T&#43;29): Finally took some Tylenol with dinner for bedtime. 8:30 PM: temperature back to my normal baseline. 11:00 PM (T&#43;32): Feeling back to normal, though worn out from the day.

                                                Two days after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, I got a pain behind my right ear. The next day, my tongue became numb, specifically focused on the right side. This caused me to lose taste on that same right side. A few days passed and I started to experience numbing on the right side of my face. The following Saturday (4/10/2021), I met with my cousin, a practicing neurologist, to discuss and test my symptoms. He determined that I have a mild case of Bell&#39;s Palsy.

                                                Around 8am in the morning, I got a intramuscular shot in my left arm on/around the deltoid muscle. I stayed at the vaccine administration location for about 30 minutes to ensure I felt okay, and left. Around 8:45 am I noticed the left side of my face was going numb. By 9am, a 2&#34; radius around my rear molars was completely numb. I immediately called the doctor who oversaw the administration and began constant communication with the doctor. I did not loose any functionality of muscles, my ability to talk, eat, or breathe. I simply felt like I had a very strong novacane shot to the upper rear gum and that numbness radiated out.  Under regular communications with the doctor and his team, I did daily check ins and updates with how I felt. The numbness started to wear off after 10 days of no medical intervention. 13 days post injection was the last day I felt any numbness. 14 days after injection I felt fine. I have not gotten the second shot. I have not felt any side effects since then.

Patient started to sweat (sweat was vissible on his forehead &amp; his shirt). I escorted patient to immunization booth and assited him to lie down on his back (supine) as recommended per immunization adverse event response protocol. I applied cold compresses to his forhead and arms, monitored his breathing, LOC and BP until emergency response team arrived. By the time emergency response arrived, the patient stated he felt better. He declined ambulance and decided to drive himself home. Both the emergency response team and the patient left the pharmacy.

I had uncontrollable shakes, chills &amp; hot flashes. Tylenol wouldn&#39;t reduce my fever. I was taken to the ER where I was given fluids, potassium and magnesium which eventually calmed my fever. My blood pressure was very low as well. I tested negative for COVID-19 and Mono. No clear indication of cause resulted from chest xray and CT scan. Later small nodules were detected in my lung. Doctor&#39;s referred this as a viral reaction but couldn&#39;t determine a cause. I was discharged from the hospital after being there about 6hrs. The next day I was lethargic but felt almost back to normal. Within 36 hours I felt 100% and like nothing ever happened.

                                                Patient came in for a Moderna Vaccine. He had no DUR&#39;s. I gave him the vaccine at 9:25am. He waited the 15min. He walked over to the blood pressure machine and took his blood pressure. He then said He was starting to feel funny. Pharmacist took his blood pressure. Initially it was156/94 pulse 114. She gave him a water. She checked on him again a few minutes later and it was 166/76 pulse 103. I check on him. He said he felt tingly and his throat was still scratchy. But he was not having any problem breathing. He said he thought he was having a panic attack. I recommended Benadryl. I gave him 50mg Benadryl orally at 10:15. He was still feeling funny after and we called a manager to get paramedics ( he wanted paramedics called). He was a little shaky and still felt bad. Paramedics arrived a little after 10:30. They ran some tests and also said they thought it was a panic attack. They did not administer any meds to him that I saw, but did take his BG, BP, and check his heart. They went ahead and wheeled him to the ER. Patient apologized, I think he felt embarrassed.

                                                Patient received his first Moderna COVID vaccine. While he was waiting the 15 minutes he started to feel pressure behind his eyes, started sweating profusely, felt dizzy, and nauseous.  I had the patient go into the IMZ room where I had him sit down.  I took his blood pressure. His heart rate was 55 bpm and his blood pressure was around 110/70.  He was not having any trouble breathing or had any signs of anaphylaxis (swelling of throat, tongue, lipps, etc). I had him remain seated and talked to him for 5 minutes. He felt like he was starting to come out of it and we took his blood pressure again.  His heart rate and gone back up to 65 and his blood pressure was around 135/75.  I had the patient remain seated for another 5-10 minutes.  Took his bp again and the numbers were similar to the second one that was previously mentioned.  He wanted to stand up and see how he was feeling.  He stood up right outside the pharmacy for another 15 minutes and said that he felt back to normal.  I explained that in the previous case where this happened to a woman they recommended she have someone drive her home and I recommended he do the same.  He seemed to think he was fine and I believe he was planning to drive himself home.

About 1 and 1/2 minutes later we were told by a customer that we had a patient in our waiting area laying on the floor. I immediately went out and saw him and told the staff to call 911. His body started convulsing and I repeated to call the manager and 911. I got down on the floor on his left side. He was face first in the concrete. There was a man sitting beside him with his hand on his back. He didn&#39;t look like he was breathing and I wanted to turn him on his back, but he started making sounds and I left him lay like he was. His body started convulsing again. Then store management appeared. The man started to lift his head and I could see that his nose looked cracked open and he was bleeding. He tried to get to a position on his knees and then I could see blood on the floor and coming from his mouth. I told him to continue to lay down and that the ambulance was coming. 2 fireman came over to assess the situation.  Then there was a woman there next to patient. It was his mother. She said that he has a history of fainting after shots. The man that was by patient&#39;s side on the floor was his father. EMS got there and started to take care of him. At this point he got to a sitting position against the wall. He did not remember any of what had happened. The EMS wanted to take him by ambulance to the hospital but patient was agitated and did not want to go by ambulance to the hospital. He thought he was fine but we were trying to tell him what had happened to him. He got up and went to the front with the EMS to sign a form. His mother and father wanted him to go to hospital to get checked out because he has never had a seizure before. We have not heard anything back yet.

                                                Patient received vaccine, was waiting for about 5 minutes in the waiting area when another customer yelled &#34;He&#39;s passing out!&#34;. Upon running over, I noticed that the patients eyes rolled in the back of his head, his legs were straight out, and was making &#34;groaning&#34; noises. He was in this state for about 30 seconds. 9-1-1 was called immediately and patient was given water. When asked if he knew where he was, he stated &#34;a pharmacy store for my COVID shot.&#34; He told me he remembers everything, saying he felt like he was in a dream during seizure. Questioned if he had ever had seizures before and he stated once when he was giving blood. No shortness of breath or hives noticed, therefore no EpiPen was administer. Ambulance arrived and asked similar questions that we had asked, and patient stated he was &#34;just hot.&#34; He also seemed a bit yellow in color. Patient was able to stand up and walk to the ambulance with little to no help. All of this occurred in about 10 minutes total.

                                                Leg cramps, body pain and headache started when I woke up at 5:30 am. Weird vivid dreams (after trying to go back to sleep) along with shooting pain through my legs. When I got up at 8 am, I felt it was like a cold without any of the nasal issues. Symptoms persisted until I took ibuprofen at 10 am. The symptoms continued throughout the day but were faintly noticeable even up until I went to sleep. The second day I woke up at 10 am with symptoms of few leg cramps and a small headache. Not nearly as bad as the first day.

                                                I for my 2nd shot on may 5th 2021 at 5pm. By 1130pm I developed a headache and pushing on my left side neck on the back side (same side I got my shot also) by 1130pm. It turned into a migraine. I took Imitrex 100mg and fell asleep and it went away. At the exact same time last night on 5/6 around 110pm a headache started caused by the same muscle ache on my left back neck. I can push on one spot and the headache gets much worse. I took 50mg Imitrex an hour ago. It&#39;s bow 457am 5/7 and the headache went right away. I&#39;m now having hot flashes and had to take my shirt off. Not sure if it&#39;s the medication or both. This is unusual for me to feel hot when it&#39;s 58F outside and 71F inside. That means something unusual is giving me headache/migraine/muscle pain in neck/hot flashes. My Imitrex never causes hot flashes. Thank you. P. S the first shot had no reaction other then soar arm. Which I have now also.

                                                Began with soreness in the arm at the site of the injection, several hours after the vaccine was administered. Progressed around 4PM to slight fatigue, headache whenever head was moved too quickly. Fatigue and headache worsened to the point that I took Acetominophen to counteract the headache at 9 PM. Went to bed at 10 PM Felt overheated during the night, but slept decently until I felt the need to urinate at ~4AM. Fell back into a half-sleep until 8AM or so. Performed my daily exercise routine (40 decline pushups, 40 pushups, 40 incline pushups, 50 situps, and 50 unweighted squats), noticed overheating more easily than normal, considerable fatigue, and headache whenever moving the head too rapidly. Had temperature taken midway through, 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Took Acetominophen for the headache around 9:30 AM. Experienced intense fatigue over the course of the day, general feeling of being overheated, and headache persisted, but felt no need for medication. Also found intense soreness in the arms (probably related to my exercise routine which involves 120 pushups altogether?) Went to bed at 10 PM. Again, woke up to relieve bladder at ~4 AM then fell back asleep. In the morning, fatigue lifted, still have a general feeling of being too warm, headache has lessened to only when I raise my voice, soreness in arms persists.

UPON INSPECTION OF THE PATIENT, I NOTICED THE PATIENT WAS SWEATING AND HAD A PALE COLOUR TO THE FACE, THEIR ARMS WERE IN A CRAMPED POSITION WITH WRISTS FLEXED INWARD. I ASKED THE PATIENT TO RELAX THEIR ARMS AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE. I CHECKED THE HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE, ASKED THE PATIENT TO SIT ON THE GROUND AGAINST A WALL, GAVE THEM WATER AND SNACKS TO HELP BRING BLOOD PRESSURE AND BLOOD GLUCOSE UP THEN CONTINUED TO MONITOR FOR 45 MIN WITH FREQUENT CHECKING OF BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE. THEIR BREATHING WAS NORMAL AND TALKING JUST FINE.

                                                Patient with no past medical history, presented to the emergency department with complaints of acute onset left-sided chest pain while getting ready for work. Pain was described as burning sensation that is somewhat improved with leaning forward. Notably patient had received his second dose of the COVID 19 vaccine series (moderna) 3 days prior to presentation. He also noted generalized weakness with hot and cold chills after the vaccination that resolved within 24 hours. ECG in the emergency department with concerning for ST-segment elevations in anterolateral leads and cardiac enzymes were positive. Patient then underwent cardiac MRI which found evidence of perimyocarditis believed to be due to acute inflammatory response to second dose of COVID-19 vaccine series as all other tests were negative and patient had no previous viral illness prodrome. The patient was treated with colchicine and later discharged home after a 3 day hospitalization.

                                                Reporting primary symptoms: headache, fever, lightheadedness, elevated heart rate, arm soreness, muscle soreness, back pain, nausea, suppressed appetite, anxiety, and panic attacks. (see below for more information) Initially, felt faint and lightheaded. Stood up and the feeling worsened. Within five minutes, felt nauseated and clammy. Also, appeared pale in the face. Was given instructions to sit, close eyes, and take deep breaths. Applied a cool, wet rag to the face and neck as needed. Was anxious and may have had a panic attack triggered by the experience. Heart rate had elevated, but not to a concerning level. Within 30 minutes of initial vaccine administration, face was no longer pale and heart rate was lowering. Other symptoms mostly subsided within 90 minutes of the vaccine administration. The next morning (5/19/21), woke with a mild headache, low grade fever, some fatigue, slight nasal congestion, and very sore arm. Took Tylenol for fever and it was mostly gone by the next day (5/20/21). Felt well enough Saturday (5/22/21) morning for lots of physical activity (push-mowed lawn in humid conditions) and only had a mild headache and mild fatigue afterward. No notable symptoms on Sunday (5/23/21) morning, but had indigestion, gas pain, and some soreness (back muscle) late that night. Stayed up a little later than normal. Woke a few hours early (around 4:30 am) on Monday (5/24/21) with throbbing low-to-mid, left-side back pain and worsened indigestion and gas pain. Had anxiety that led to a panic attack. Did not feel well and tried stretching, taking Tums, deep breathing, used the bathroom, and walked around. This was helpful enough to return to sleep. Woke up again at 8:45 am and had a mild headache, some soreness in neck/shoulders, and anxiety about the situation. Took a shower, did some deep breathing, and tried to relax. Drank some caffeine at noon, but the headache was not relieved. Appetite was somewhat suppressed and was mildly lightheaded. Stomach became more unsettle by night. Stopped all caffeine intake and NSAID usage (and still no intake/usage at the time of this report). At night, anxiety over the situation worsened, so tried deep breathing, talking to others about the situation, and stretching. Panic attack occurred, but was able to manage with the aforementioned techniques. Woke the next day (5/25/21) with mild headache, muscle soreness in mid-to-upper back, shoulders, and neck, suppressed appetite, and anxiety. Was able to manage most symptoms with breathing, stretching, relaxing,  and talking through the situation. No panic attack on 5/25/21. Went to bed earlier than normal (around 9:30 pm) and woke on 5/26/21 around 9:30 am. Had similar symptoms, but appetite was more decreased and worsened anxiety. Decided to see doctor that afternoon (see item 19 for more information on testing from that visit) and was told to give more time to recover from vaccine side effects. Did not give doctor information about anxiety or panic attacks at that time.  Had a panic attack (less severe than previous) Wednesday night and managed with the aforementioned techniques. Thursday (5/27/21) morning woke with no headache and no fever, but still some soreness in neck/shoulder area, suppressed appetite, mild fatigue, and mild anxiety about the situation. No panic attack on 5/27/21. Friday (5/28/21) woke with similar symptoms and decided to visit doctor again about anxiety. Was prescribed Buspar and Zoloft. After taking Buspar (first time ever) at 2:30 pm, experienced an increased heart rate up to 160bpm and a low fever up to 100.2F. Experienced another panic attack during this time. Sought medical assistance from local ER around 3:30 pm. Was seen and monitored until discharge at about 11:45 pm. During stay, tests and levels were mostly normal except during a panic attack that was triggered after blood was drawn. Treated with Vistaril around 11:20 pm and monitored for about 20 minutes before being discharged. Anxiety was relieved after deep breathing and relaxing. Did not take Zoloft. Slept and woke on 5/29/21 with mild headache, unsettled stomach, and mild anxiety. Anxiety is more manageable so far and other symptoms were somewhat improved after eating breakfast. Currently, no plans to continue taking Buspar, but will consult doctor.

                                                blurry vision five minutes after the shot; seizures on the same day; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of VISION BLURRED (blurry vision five minutes after the shot) and SEIZURE (seizures on the same day) in a 30-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 027C21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (had covid-19 twice before receiving the vaccine once in APR-2021) in April 2021. Concurrent medical conditions included Epilepsy. Concomitant products included LEVETIRACETAM (KEPPRA [LEVETIRACETAM]), LAMOTRIGINE, LOPERAMIDE HYDROCHLORIDE (LOMOTIL [LOPERAMIDE HYDROCHLORIDE]), ATORVASTATIN, LORAZEPAM (ATIVAN), ONDANSETRON (ZOFRAN [ONDANSETRON]) and CLONAZEPAM (KLONOPIN) for an unknown indication.    On 12-May-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-May-2021, the patient experienced VISION BLURRED (blurry vision five minutes after the shot) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). 12-May-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (seizures on the same day) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 12-May-2021 to 19-May-2021 due to SEIZURE and VISION BLURRED. At the time of the report, VISION BLURRED (blurry vision five minutes after the shot) outcome was unknown and SEIZURE (seizures on the same day) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In April 2021, Computerised tomogram: unknown (Inconclusive) unknown. In April 2021, Lumbar puncture: unknown (Inconclusive) spinal tab from CNS fluid to make sure there was no cox in his brain. In April 2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: unknown (Inconclusive) unknown.     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was withdrawn on an unknown date.       The patient had epilepsy as pre-existing condition and he was on unspecified medication for that. The patient has seizures on the same day of vaccination and was transferred to hospital. Patient had magnetic resonance scan (MRI) and patient had seizures over there for which he was moved to sister hospital where they did scan under anesthesia. Before discharging patient from hospital they took spinal tab from central nervous system (CNS) fluid to make sure there was no Cyclooxygenase (COX) in his brain.  Patient&#39;s physician told to not receive the second dose of Moderna vaccine.   No treatment information was reported.

                                                Roughly 20 minutes after injection I quickly started to feel nauseous and light headed. I made me way back to the pharmacy (barely) which was around 50&#39; or less away. On my way there my vision started to fade away and go white then would come back. I made it to the counter, said I was sick, and collapsed on the ground as I could no longer stand. I quickly became more sick, became very hot, and started sweating badly. I needed to vomit but since I had not ate that day (not uncommon for me and the pharmacist was aware before I received the shot) I could not. At the same time as I was in the floor I had to put all of my concentration into not shitting my pants in front if everyone staring at me. I remember them asking me if I needed an ambulance and I don&#39;t remember responding or being able to process what was going on. They did call and ambulance and by the time they arrived I was feeling better. After collapsing they took my blood pressure while waiting for the ambulance and they told me afterward it was 81/61. When the EMT&#39;s were there they tested it several times and said it was normal. They also tested my blood sugar which was 111. They ran an EKG and said everything looked fine. They recommended I go to the hospital but I declined as I was afraid to get billed for it as well as not having a way back to my vehicle or most importantly someone to watch my dog. Though I probably should of gone. As an added possible beneficial piece of information, I went through a similar experience years ago when donating plasma.

I woke up to find that the right side of my face was weak - right eye hard to close, weak lower lip, and even foods/drinks had different or less taste. These symptoms have worsened a bit, most noticeable being my less active right eyelids and the weakness in my lips/face muscles (right side) makes it hard/embarrassing to talk or laugh, as my mouth becomes contorted.

No Medical History information was reported.    On 04-May-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 04-May-2021, the patient experienced CRANIOCEREBRAL INJURY (Brain trauma) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant and life threatening), LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and medically significant), FALL (Fell on cement floor) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), EPISTAXIS (Bleeding from nose) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and SPEECH DISORDER (Could talk but not rational) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and disability). In May 2021, the patient experienced CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and disability). On an unknown date, the patient experienced BRAIN OEDEMA (Brain Swelling) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant and life threatening), SKULL FRACTURE (Multiple skull fractures) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant and life threatening) and MOVEMENT DISORDER (trouble picking things up and raising his legs) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and disability). The patient was hospitalized from 04-May-2021 to 20-May-2021 due to BRAIN OEDEMA, CRANIOCEREBRAL INJURY, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS and SKULL FRACTURE. The patient was treated with Surgery (On 07-May-2021, right part of skull was removed surgically to control brain swelling.) for Brain oedema; Surgery (On 08-May-2021 surgery was performed to remove multiple skull fractures.) for Skull fracture; Rehabilitation therapy for Confusional state; Rehabilitation therapy for Movement disorder and Rehabilitation therapy for Speech disorder. At the time of the report, CRANIOCEREBRAL INJURY (Brain trauma), BRAIN OEDEMA (Brain Swelling), SKULL FRACTURE (Multiple skull fractures), CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused) and SPEECH DISORDER (Could talk but not rational) was resolving, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out) had resolved, FALL (Fell on cement floor) and EPISTAXIS (Bleeding from nose) outcome was unknown and MOVEMENT DISORDER (trouble picking things up and raising his legs) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       On 26May21 patient moved to a rehabilitation facility where he still remains 9Jun21.  He  awoke on 17May21 but was still confused. He is now making good progress and can now walk and talk but needed therapy to relearn these.  He  will need out patient therapy when they release him.  He still requires surgery to replace bone flap and has to wear a helmet. The goal is that he will be normal in 6 months but he is still having trouble picking things up and raising his legs.

                                                I am the patient&#39;s neurologist. The patient has very well controlled epilepsy without a seizure in over a year. He is compliant with medication and did not have another provoking factor.  Approximately 6 hours after receiving the vaccine he had a generalized seizure, which was witnessed by his wife. He had an aura, behavioral arrest, tonic-clonic activity for 1 minute followed by a post-ictal period of several hours. This is consistent with his known seizures, but the provocation appears to be the vaccine he received earlier in the day.

He notes he was not until approximately 1.75 hours after vaccination that he began to develop a runny nose and aching primarily in his arm.  He felt this might be normal but then soon after developed a hot itchy tight feeling in his throat with ongoing rhinorrhea, mild tightness in breathing and soreness in his left arm. He has had similar reactions with Remicade in the past and they became severe and that is why he is no longer using Remicade.

I have not had covid and have not been sick since pandemic started. The following morning I woke up with a fever of 101 and extreme arm pain. As the morning progressed, I continued to have increasing fever even after taking Tylenol 500mg every 4-6 hours. My fever peaked at 104.7 by 3pm on 1/20, then started to come down after taking 400mg of ibuprofen. By 9pm on 1/20, my fever started to spike again and then I took more inbuprofen. As of 1/21, I am still having symptoms of being unwell and nausea, as well as low grade fever of 101. I do not have any covid symptoms (no cough, no loss of taste).

Temperature was not recorded. Treatment: I took acetaminophen by mouth shortly after symptom onset. I took an additional acetaminophen 6 hours later. I then took ibuprofen 3 hours after that. Outcome: Symptoms were controlled with acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Symptoms completely resolved within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine dose.

                                                I received it at 10am and around 2am that night I started to have a bad headache and body aches. I would fall asleep for a bit but then at 4am I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was so unbearable that I would clinch my eyes shut. Bones and muscle pains all over. Violent hot/cold flashes. I would feel hot all over and after a minute or so of placing a cold pack on my head I began to shiver despite sweating. Around 5am I was looking at my phone wondering if I should go to the ER because I legitimately felt like I was in danger.  The unbearable headache lasted a total of 14 hours from its onset. No OTC medications were taken.  Around 6pm on day 2 from the dose the intensity of the headache began to subside VERY slowly.  I woke up on day 3 completely fine as if nothing happened.

They begin vomiting and sweating heavily within 30 minutes after the vaccine. They felt very dizzy and were unable to walk from the clinic to their car and had to find a ride home from the facility. They were unable to return to their shift that evening.

The rash was dark red, was warm to the touch, and felt tight. No increased pain or itching. I took a antihistamine the following day and these seemed to help reduce the rash. It was gone after 4 days.

I woke up around the10 am  the 25th.the next day. I had a migraine that wouldn&#39;t go away. I was feeling nauseous and still had a light sensitive headache. I took Migraine medication, and eventually mid afternoon the symptoms went away. Less than 24 hours later I was back to normal. March 4th I was using Gold Bond Ultimate Mens lotion and had an adverse reaction. My hand swelled up, and got red.  I took Benadryl and it went away. March 5th I used Curel lotion and the same thing happened. Did not take Benadryl.

                                                At approximately 930 am, Offender was vaccinated in Housing Unit and returned to his bed. He was monitored by nursing staff for 15 minutes and had no adverse reaction or side effects. At approximately 1030am, Offender  was called to the officer&#39;s desk and was told to report to the visiting room for vaccination. Upon arrival, offender  was again vaccinated in the opposite arm. Offender was called in error rather than his room mate was who was an add on to the vaccination list. Offender was admitted to the Health Care Unit for observation for 24 hrs. Vital signs remained stable throughout this period with only a complaint of bilateral sore arms.  There were nono additional sequelae. Office of Health Services was notified of the incident on February 25, 2021 and began a review as part of our quality improvement process and in order to recommend practice modifications, provide education, implement policy change, monitor outcomes and prevent re-occurrence.  OHS reviewed information obtained from Moderna regarding the management of vaccine administration errors.  The error at facility is known as an &#34;invalid dose&#34;.  In general there is limited information, yet low risk, for individuals who either receive a second dose within 21 days or a higher than authorized dose volume. The recommendations in this guidance related to the facility occurrence are summarized:  Second dose administered in &lt; 21 days  Do not repeat dose. Higher than authorized dose volume administered  Do not repeat dose. *  Inform the recipient of the potential for local and systemic adverse.    Additional recommendations from the process:   1. Identity verification.  There were several opportunities for Health Care Staff, Security Staff, and  Guardsmen to confirm the identify of Offender. a. All offenders must wear their ID throughout all steps of the vaccination process.   b. Health Care Staff, Security Staff, andGuardsmen must verify offender identities as needed for their assignments throughout each step the vaccination process c. Health care staff must verify accurate completion of offender vaccination forms and ensure that forms match the offender being vaccinated.  d. Health care and Security staff must identify offenders by offender name and number rather than housing assignment. e. Use of handwritten lists should be minimized.  Other pre-printed available rosters or spreadsheets are preferable 2. Offender completed two sets of consent forms for vaccination.  It is unclear if he did not understand the process, or exactly why he would repeat the vaccination process.   a. Though language did not appear to be an issue, appropriate interpreters should be made available to obtain consents and provide education. b. When necessary consent forms should be provided in the native language spoken by the offender. c. It is unclear why there was no further attempt to confirm that Offender had previously received a vaccination that day, after stating that fact to those present before he received his second dose of vaccine. In the future, if an individual states that he or she has already been vaccinated the process must stop until his or her claims have been verified or shown to be false. 3. Any unplanned changes to the onsite vaccination plan (add-ons, extra dose redistribution, team deployment etc.) must be communicated to all members of the vaccination team.  4. Health care staff alone are responsible for the completion of all consent forms and vaccination documentation.   5. Identify best practices and standardize vaccination add-ons across facilities. Consider: location, addition to master vaccination roster, etc. a. Perhaps add-on vaccinations can be moved to another area for tracking. b. Add-ons should be added to the master vaccination roster.  Additional recommendations: 6. Re-Training on the vaccination protocol for health care, operations and national guard staff.    The above items were completed.

He reports mild swelling under his right eye, as well as to his right cheek area. He also reports that he can?t fully open his right eye, which impairs his field of vision; otherwise, denies any vision changes. Instructed that the symptoms were suggestive of Bell?s Palsy, but to go straight to ER for further evaluation.

Shingles healing right as I got second shot on March 5th and had same high fever sick reaction as first week of second shot but with diarrhea this time which I did not have the first time.

Treated with 1 Benadryl and 1 Claritin near the 45 minute mark. Symptoms improved about 1 hour and 30 minutes after getting the vaccine and were no longer noticeable by 3 PM (approx 3 hours after vaccine). After the throat swelling receded I noticed a little bit of numbness in the tongue and throat for another 1-2 hours (4-5 hours after the vaccine). Swelling of throat was uncomfortable but not severe enough to cause breathing issues. There were also no problems swallowing or speaking.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was fine until after a few minutes.  He started to say he felt lightheaded.  He placed is head between his knees, he started to sweat and I gave him some water at his request.  He sat back and started to get pale and more sweaty, he complained about pain in his arm and neck.  He then began to slightly shake and passed out.  He was awoken very quickly by his wife who was standing in front of him.  We kept talking to him and I checked his pulse and called 911.  After about 30 minutes he was feeling much better and did not need to go to the hospital.  His vitals were strong and he walked out on his own.  I contacted him 3 hours later and he was resting but feeling fine.

An hour later, I started to feel tired and weak, and the soreness in my arm worsened slightly. The pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 3.  45 minutes later, I experienced stiffness in my neck and upper back, though that isn&#39;t unusual for me. I also started to feel nauseous and cold at that time, but the nausea subsided within an hour.  The severity of these symptoms stayed the same the rest of the evening. I went to bed at midnight, and woke the next morning at 8am. My arm where I had received the shot felt much more sore and painful, especially when I move it, and mainly when any pressure is applied to the area. I was woken by pain in my arm when I payed on that side of my body. The pain is now a 4, but a 7 when pressure is applied. It is now 12:30 pm.

I pretty much had the same symptoms as the first dose: chills, body aches. headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue. It lasted for about 3-4 days. Now, I stared with bloody stools with my first dose and it never really resolved before I got the second dose. I noticed it increased the frequency, made it a little worse after the second dose. They were not so frequent anymore. I still have blood in my stool at least 2 times a week.

He reported no swelling, so I gave him a 25mg of benadryl and took his BP, which was 142/92. He did not eat breakfast so I got him some crackers and water and watched him. I recommended he call his doctor, he did and they told him to go to ER so I offered to call a squad and he declined. He did not want to go to ER, but wanted to get seen at urgent care. I walked him down to urgent care since the numbness had not improved. He came back to the pharmacy a few hours later and reported that when the benadryl kicked in the numbness subsided and he feels just fine now. He is going to follow up with his primary care doctor tomorrow.

                                                At approximately 9:00 PM (roughly 11.5 hours after vaccination)  I became extremely light headed with slurred speech. I experienced tunnel vision and dizziness. My face turned white, and my lips were a blue color. I sat down immediately, which improved my condition temporarily.   But, within 2 minutes I began experiencing tunnel vision and dizziness again while sitting upright. I laid down on my back and elevated my legs.  My vision returned and but I remained dizzy and pale. I experienced some numbness and tingling in my extremities.  My wife attached a fingertip pulse oximeter to my finger at this time (we did not have a tool to check blood pressure on hand). My blood %SpO2 read between  95 and 98% and pulse ranged from 95 to 101 bpm.  I did NOT experience: difficulty breathing, swelling of the airway, nor itching.   Since I was not having difficulty breathing, and my symptoms seemed to indicate low blood pressure or potentially low blood sugar I decided to wait it out and see if my symptoms worsened.    While laying on the floor, I consumed a glass of milk and a few oreo cookies, hoping to counter hypoglycemia (if that&#39;s what was going on).  After approximately 15 minutes my condition began to improve - I could sit up slightly with only mild dizziness and color began returning to my face. After approximately 30 minutes, I was able to stand and walk to my couch and lay down. After around an hour, I was feeling almost back to normal with only a slight dizziness and tiredness remaining.  12 hours after the adverse event (24 hours post vaccination) I feel okay, slightly lightheaded but generally fine. I intend to call a doctor and discuss if any further tests are necessary.

My tinnitus was not bad the day of or had flared up before taking the vaccine.   1-2 days after having the first dosage of the vaccine I noticed my tinnitus was a lot worse, more noticeable, extremely high pitched, and unbearable for most of the time, on top of the &#34;sickness&#34; and &#34;sore arm&#34; symptoms. This lasted a couple of days (about 3-4 days) after the vaccine. This also happened for the second dose I received on 4/1/21.  I did check in my symptoms on the v-check application (first dose only).

AT 1:30 am - 4/9/2021 (14 hours after shot), I awoke out of my sleep and was freezing. I got up and layer up on clothing and drank some water. From 1:30 am - 5:45 am- 4/9/2021, I was wide awake, but tired , yawning, freezing, and had a temp of 99.9. My mouth got very dry and I was drink just a little water, but found myself having to run to the restroom once an hours. My temp slowly got down to 99.2 by 5:30am. During this time, I was also nauseous from shaking so much from being cold. I slept for another 15 minutes and then was wide awake from 6:10 am- 7:30  and then fell asleep till 9:30am. As of 12:00pm, - 4-9-2021 I have slept maybe 4 hrs, I have a headache, my arm is throbbing and I am tired. I also feel like I have a bunch of mucus in my throat (but that could be from allergies).

                                                Administered Moderna vaccination at 12:40 pm Sunday April  11,2021. Instructed patient to sit and wait in the vaccination waiting area for 15 minutes. Patient approached me  10 minutes into waiting time and told me he did not feel well. Patient was drenched in sweat. I instructed my tech to paged code white while I stayed with him. I advised him to remove his sweater and face mask. He said he had labored breathing and did not have much energy to talk. I provided him with ice pack, and had him sit down in the clinical service room. His sweat was dissipating. His finance stated he may need electrolytes and he gets anxious with needles. Front lead staff provided him with Gatorade, he took few sips.  He requested Emergency medical services to be called. He called his finance on the phone and informed her of his current condition. He stated he drove 1 hour and 45 minutes to get here and did not feel well enough to drive. EMS came on site and evaluated him. The patient requested to be taken to hospital, after further evaluation they transported him to the hospital. Patient was alert, but seemed slow to respond to questions. He kept stating he did not feel well. We advised him we call EMS and they are on the way.

                                                So I got the vaccine on January 23rd and the Sunday following I started noticing I was getting very dizzy I went to the ear doctor they said it was not my inner ear so I went to a heart doctor and they did a tilt table test and the tilt table suggested orthostatic hypotension. The heart doctor did alot of heart tests and the heart is good. My vision was blurry with constant headaches went to an eye doctor and I have onset strabismus in my right eye and then I went to a neurologist because the tips of my toes were numb . The heart doctor has me on fludrocortisone and metropolol because my heart rate was very high all the time ever since the vaccine it was stuck at 130 to 150 beats per minute no matter if I was resting or sitting. My pupils oscillate and ever since the adverse reaction started I have had pupillary athetosis or hippus. Horrible brain fog can&#39;t think clearly or sleep well insomnia came with all of this as well. I go to the mayoclinic, because dysautonomia is expected.

He blackout but I quickly got him to lay flat on floor. During that time (about a minute) he had some jerking and wet himself a bit. I elevated his feet and called my technician just in case needed to call 911 and perform CPR/Epi but we didn&#39;t need to go that route. He loss his consciousness and quickly regained it after about a minute. I had him continue to remain laying down for 15 mins and then after patient felt comfortable I helped him back into seat inside vaccine room to monitor patient for another 20 minutes. After monitoring he was fine and left thanking me that I stayed calm to help him.

As he was sitting down his head threw back, he stiffened, his eyes moved left to right, and he was not responding.  The nurse and I immediately tried to lower him to the floor.  While we were doing this he partly regained consciousness as another staff member called EMS.  He was talking and answering questions when EMS arrived.  They transported him to the hospital.

I woke up in the middle of the night after receiving the vaccine and had trouble going back to sleep.  I was having trouble regulating my body temperature, I was swinging from hot to cold all day.  I felt weak all day.  I had lower appetite.  Symptoms should get better in 36 hours.  In the end I am glad to have the vaccine and be safe, thank you for all you do.

                                                After few minutes of getting the vaccine, patient fainted for couple of seconds while sitting on the chair. Patient regained consciousness right away and was place on the floor lying down with legs raised. Paramedics were called to check on the patient. While waiting for the paramedics, was asked if he has any chronic conditions or had any breakfast in the morning prior to getting the vaccination. Pulse was checked and was 90 bpm. After couple minutes of lying down was moved to a chair to sit. He appeared to be shaking and nervous. Paramedics came and checked his glucose, blood pressure, pulse and asked few questions before clearing him. Patient refused to go to the hospital and sat down for 10-15 minutes before returning to his home.

Quickly escalated to difficult swallowing, body tingling, and extreme anxiety that almost caused a full blown panic attack. Luckily it subsided after about 20 mins of duress. Unfortunately around 12 hours after the injection at 3 AM I began experiencing quite severe flu like symptoms including nausea, extreme fatigue\weakness, occasional gagging, pain and diarrhea. Lasted until I awoke on the 12th (today) at approximately 8 am. Spent entire time in an on\off sleep also tried treating with tylenol and flu medication to no avail. Temperatures were checked twice both times results were in the high 99&#39;s.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    Co-suspect product included non-company product ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) solution for injection for Crohn&#39;s disease.    Concurrent medical conditions included Crohn&#39;s disease (moderate to severe).   On 14-Oct-2020, the patient started ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) (Subcutaneous) dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE (grand maul seizure) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (vision changes) and NECK PAIN (Feelings of pressure at the back of his neck radiating to right side of his head). At the time of the report, GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE (grand maul seizure) had resolved and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (vision changes) and NECK PAIN (Feelings of pressure at the back of his neck radiating to right side of his head) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient had a seizure three days after his first Moderna Covid vaccine and was hospitalized.  CT scan was negative.  The reporter&#39;s causality for co-suspect drug, adalimumab, was not provided.  Concomitant product use was not provided. No treatment information was provided.  This case concerns an adult male, with PMH of Crohn&#39;s disease, hospitalized with a serious unexpected event of generalized tonic-clonic seizure (grand mal seizure), and nonserious unexpected visual impairment and neck pain. Event onset with unknown latency after first dose mRNA-1273. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an adult male, with PMH of Crohn&#39;s disease, hospitalized with a serious unexpected event of generalized tonic-clonic seizure (grand mal seizure), and nonserious unexpected visual impairment and neck pain.

He awoke about 10 seconds later and was afebrile, aware of his surroundings, and showed no signs of anaphylaxis. He vomited after awakening. I asked him to sit in in the post-vaccination area for 30 more minutes while I monitored him. He refused EMS services, but I was able to get him to have a family member pick him up to take him to the emergency room.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the second dose of the Moderna Vaccine on 05/12/2021 I started having chills. This progressed through the night with a fever reaching 104.2F. After taking 750mg of acetaminophen the fever reduced to around 102F. The fever persisted at 102F accompanied by heavy perspiration for approximately 40 hours with 750mg of acetaminophen being taken every 6 hours. For about 10 more hours the fever stayed around 100F with chills and constant perspiration until dehydration set in. Nausea limited the amount of water that could be consumed ultimately resulting in mild dehydration. After fever broke I continue to have headaches through filling out this form along with sharp pains in my lower left leg on the front of the leg. I also have a lot of pain in the upper right glute as if I had been hit my something quite hard. For about 48 hours while these symptoms occurred I remained in bed and tried to drink water. I spoke with the pharmacist who administered the vaccine today and she advised me to report my symptoms right away and to follow up with my doctor on Tuesday or Wednesday if my symptoms persist.

Nothing out of the ordinary. 2. Second day, I felt tired, similar to what I would feel if I am getting  the flu. I felt as if I had a elevated body temperature, but the forehead thermometer was normal. 3. Third day, I felt better overall, only had the soreness in the arm left. 4. Day 12, I noticed 3 patches of a rash on and around the injection site. I only noticed them because I felt my arm warmer than usual. The texture of the rash is a bit different than my regular skin, mildly reddish in color, 1 patch is 2 inches in diameter, the others are smaller. I called in to vaccination team and the nurse took my statement and directed me to report it here.

I woke up on 05/26/21 at approximately 0120h feeling the need to urinate and was very sweaty, hot and thirsty. I sat down to urinate, and I felt dizzy standing back up. I was feeling very thirsty so proceeded to walk to get some water. I fainted after walking about 10 feet. I regained consciousness, and I drank water and ingested an Advil with the help of my wife. I felt a lot better after drinking the water, but still had a mild throbbing headache. I went back to sleep, and the fever symptoms came and went which affected my sleep quality. I drank more water any time I woke up. I took 2 more Advil as well at one time waking up. I woke up around 1300h on 05/26/21 feeling a lot better and a little more well rested. My fever symptoms are gone, but I am still a little sensitive to cold and feeling a little weak.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  About 10 minutes after I got the shot I felt a small pain in the left side of my chest. It lasted about two minutes before passing so I wasn&#39;t very concerned, I thought it was just part of the shot. About an hour after the shot the pain in my chest came back much worse. Ten minutes after the chest pain my arms felt numb. I struggled with opening and closing my hands. I have terrible insurance, no primary care physician and don&#39;t have the money for hospital bills so i didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. I slept a couple hours hoping I&#39;d feel better when I woke. It didn&#39;t help. The pain and numbness lasted about two days, most of which I tried to sleep through. I still have a off feeling in my chest that I don&#39;t know how to describe. My family tried to getting me to go to the ER but I resisted for the reasons mentioned. I&#39;m supposed to get my second shot on the eleventh but I&#39;m scared of what will happen.

                                                The following day I became increasingly fatigued, roughly 30 hours later I took a 2 hour nap. I awoke and had dinner, about 5 minutes after finishing my heartbeat felt &#39;regularly irregular&#39; and was 55 bpm, which is normal for me at rest. I became nauseous, dizzy, full-body tingling, laid on the floor near the toilet for about 20 minutes. My wife reported my lips became purple and I was pale.  I assumed it was hypotension (vasovagal?) of some kind as I&#39;ve had this happen after blood draws in the past. I drank a bunch of water to get my blood pressure up and smelled peppermint oil to decrease nausea. I was okay thereafter, but I slept around 13 hours that night.

One of my colleagues (a surgeon) looked and me and prescribed. Treatment was antihistamine and steroid DosePac . The rash may have improved with  the treatment; however, the blisters took awhile to heal and I&#39;m still itchy. Swings in temperature  -in the room, or in the water or anywhere it swings - the itching gets worse. I crawl up my skin for the itching. I&#39;ve tried cremes and calamine lotion and oatmeal baths.

Besides general left arm soreness for 2-3 days following vaccine, I had no other symptoms until Sunday January 3rd, at which time I began to notice increased fatigue, chills, and mild cough. Symptoms did not subside by Monday morning, January 4th, and I called in sick to work and requested that I receive a Covid 19 test from an urgent care. I tested positive for Covid 19 that day, and remained off work until 1/14/21. I experienced moderate chills, moderate increased skin sensitivity, and significant fatigue from 1/3/21 to 1/8/21, sleeping ~16-20 hours per day every day during that time. I began feeling better 1/9/21 and symptoms gradually improved until I was symptom-free on 1/12/21. I returned to work on 1/14/21, &gt;10 days following initial symptoms.

I went to the hospital because I felt I was going to throw up and I had to hold on to my stomach, felt a stabbing sensation to my stomach and the pain was unbearable. They performed an ultrasound of the abdomen and a CT scan of the abdomen. I also had an endoscopy performed after my 2nd vaccine. I had a biopsy of my stomach and I am pending results.

While at work, co-workers noticed I had paralysis in the left side of my face. I was rushed to the emergency room under suspicions that I was having a stroke. The doctor diagnosed me with ?Bells Palsy?. The left side of my face is noticeably paralyzed.

                                                I got the second dose at 1:30 pm on March 8th. At around 1:30 AM on March 9th I began feeling very cold and shaking uncontrollably. I had a sharp and persistent headache that lasted most of the night. I felt a little pain in my chest, and even when I took deep breaths it never felt like I had enough air. I&#39;m wondering in the breathing difficulties might have been due to heartburn/indigestion. I had to stop taking my heartburn medicine because it&#39;s not good for my kidneys (I also have kidney disease). On rare occasions I have had symptoms from heartburn that feel almost like asthma. The fever-symptoms and chills subsided a few hours later after I took a Tylenol, but I continue to feel fatigued and I have a bad headache.

                                                A few minutes after the vaccine was administered the patient felt hot, lightheaded, dizzy and had to sit down.  While sitting down his eye rolled back and he passed out.  His spouse said his body was shaking.  She lowered him to the floor and he awoke.  Paramedics were called and determined his blood pressure was very low. They tried to stand the patient up to take another blood pressure reading, but the patient had to sit down as he became dizzy and lightheaded again.  The paramedics took him to the ER where the doctor said he was fine and discharged him.

                                                Patient developed pain radiating up into the right side of his scalp starting about two weeks after the injection which was in the right deltoid. . The pain then progressed to the right neck and supraclavicular area. He felt throbbing , sore, numbness as well and &#34;shocks&#34;. Over the next view days the pain was shooting down his triceps and numbness and tingling and then numbness in the fourth and fifth fingers. No muscle weakness and no fever or chills. No systemic symptoms. He complained of the tingling numbness and a sense of swelling--all down the right arm in the c6-7 distribution. On April first his wife noted a vesicular rash on the right side of his neck with a few lesions on the right upper back. He was not responding to NSAIDs, ice or heat, immobilization, so at this point the clinical diagnosis of shingles/varicella zoster was made and Valtrex 1000 mg tid was started.

Talked with the patient and he was not very responsive then went unconscious where he was kept him from hitting the ground. I grabbed the patient to prevent them from falling, his eyes appeared to roll slightly and his leg twitched. He was unconscious  and unresponsive for approximately 10 seconds or less while making some grunts/groans. He came to consciousness and sat upright and began drinking water. He says he remembers immediately before but couldn&#39;t remember the exact event. The ambulance was called at initial event and arrived and took him at that point to continue checking on him. Blood pressure was approximately 117/76 with a pulse of 55 form blood pressure cuff over his shirt.

The symptoms started at 0800 and were severe enough that he was having difficulty speaking, so he had a friend talk to dispatch. He was given 2 doses of IM epinephrine, 50 mg Benadryl, and 125 mg Solumedrol by EMS and transferred to the ER department at the Community Hospital.

                                                I was released from quarantine from my Covid-19 infection 5 days prior to getting the first Moderna vaccine in the morning. By the evening, I felt sicker than I ever have in my entire life. I was shaking uncontrollably, had a fever, extreme chills, and a pounding headache and muscle aches. I didn&#39;t sleep that night and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until noon the next day. I am still lethargic today and seemed to have lost my sense of smell.   My Covid-19 symptoms from the 2 weeks prior were extremely mild and the vaccine experience was 1,000x worse. Something isn&#39;t right and I am questioning whether I should get the second shot.

I can typically wrap my hand around my feet easily (i.e., touch my toes).  However, I had leg tightness so strong I could barely make it to my shins.   I went to work. Had chills, malaise,  pain at the injection site, and continued intense leg pain until I took an acetaminophen (500mg) at 2:00 p.m. on April 9.   Hip and butt tightness continued for the rest of April 9 and through part of April 10.   Redness and pain at the injection site continued until April 12.

Pain grew through the night. Headache became a migraine sometime between 4-6am. By 10am the pain was among the worst I?ve felt. Developed low grade fever around this time (about 100.8 F). I took 2 regular strength OTC tablets of Tylenol sometime between 10am and 12pm.  The head pain only lessened a little in severity. Sometime around 3pm the migraine dissipated rapidly. For the following 24 hours, I had no pain but felt lethargic.

                                                Patient came in excited to get his first moderna covid vaccine. Got his dose at around 1230pm and was instructed to sit down for 15 minute post -vaccine to make sure he felt ok before leaving.  About 10-15 minutes later, he came up to the cashiers and his face was pressed against the plyglass and started to go down.  (RPH) and (tech) ran out to catch him from falling to the ground.  We pulled a chair up to where he was so he could sit down.  He reported to be warm, weak, and dizzy.  He remained seated but was alert.  He has no allergies, no medical conditions, no prior reactions to vaccinations.  He last ate at 8:30am.  He said he felt warm, but I took his temp again and it was 96.7 degrees.  We gave him some water and he remained seated.  After several minutes, he was able to get up and was fine with moving his chair away from the front registers and towards the side wall (within sight of pharmacy).  Kept checking on him and he was getting better and better.  He did call his friend to pick him up instead of driving home himself.

                                                Uncontrollable shaking for roughly 1-hour and 20-minutes. Convulsive as though extreme hypothermic, patient could not control it.  Shaking was so severe that my wife woke up in bed (heavy sleeping) and was so concerned that she was going to call 911, instead she called ER first and they said they couldn&#39;t provide any advice. I said I felt cold, even though I had a fever that was extremely high (no thermometer to measure) my wife then put the 30lb weighted blanket on me and after about 15-minutes the shaking started to decrease before finally subsiding completely. I then had a drink of water at room temperature which lowered my internal core body temperature and slight shaking started again until I warmed back up and stopped. Our house was 73 degrees F which normally I would sleep in my underwear, instead I was fully dressed, under all our blankets plus the 30lb weighted blanket and I still felt cold.  That night I had sweated more than ever, my pillow was literally a swamp and stayed damp until the next night although pillow cases were removed. Half of the king size bed was soaking wet and yet I still felt cold.  I sweated through the sheets again for 2 more nights before my body finally started regulating its temperature again and have since been okay. Felt very lethargic for 5-days.

My right cheekbone is also sensitive to touch. I have no physical rash or reaction on my skin. It?s all nerve feeling. The right side of my upper chest feels more tight than normal. With my history of spontaneous pneumothoraxes I usually have a good feeling on my lungs and chest. This feels tighter than normal and came on about 12 hours post vaccine shot. Otherwise I feel much better today than yesterday. This nerve feeling is still there however.

                                                I began to feel nauseous and lightheaded while brushing my teeth around 10:30 pm several hours after I received the first injection of the Moderna COVID vaccination. I sat down and started feeling very hot. I passed out a few moments later. I woke a few minutes or seconds after passing out and was evaluated by EMTs. They said my vitals looked good, but strongly recommended I go to the emergency room for further evaluation. The ER performed and EKG and bloodwork, both of which were normal. I was told this was most likely vasovagal syncope and sent home. I have had a previous history of fainting from injury or injections. This was different because the fainting has previously occurred minutes or seconds after the triggering event versus hours. Since that night, I&#39;ve  been tired and experienced occasional lightheadedness. I saw my primary care doctor today (4/21) and he advised me to fill out this report.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine at 10:00am on 4/13, 28 days after my first one. On Fri, 4/16 at 4:00am, I woke up to use the restroom and voided my bladder. Shortly thereafter, I felt very nauseous and cold clammy. I had a sip of water, than sat down next the toilet since I thought I had food poisoning and needed to throw up. Instead, I passed out and fell from a sitting position against the wall. I woke up a few seconds later, to find my right ear cut and with quite a bit of blood (not sure what I cut it on, maybe my own thumb nail?). I stood up and walked to the sink, so I could bleed over it while apply pressure so I wouldn&#39;t make a mess. My wife had woken up at this point, and shortly after I got to the sink, I passed out again while standing (fortunately she caught me) and started twitching for a few seconds before coming to (I came to while still standing up). At this point, my wife drove me to the emergency room and we were admitted. In the ER from 4:15am-7am, they did a CT scan on my head without contracts, blood work, and an EKG. All three tests came back normal and I was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope. I have no history of any prior vasovagal event. At the ER they also sewed my ear up with 6 dissolvable stitches, gave me a big of IV fluids, a tetanus shot, and then sent me on my way, discharging me at 7:00am on 4/16. I then saw my primary care doctor that afternoon at 1:00pm on 4/16 who reviewed by medical records/test results from the ER, concurred with their vasovagal syncope diagnosis, checked my stitches, and said I could go back to normal activity largely unrestricted. I haven&#39;t had any issues since; so not overly concerned (other than the &gt;$2,500 of ER hospital bills that are piling up), but just reporting this so you have the data.

                                                Patient felt that his throat was tightening 5 minutes after vaccination during his observation period. He was immediately pulled into a private exam room. Vitals were stable at that time. 50 mg of IM Benadryl was administered. Patient did not improve with this treatment and went on to develop a muffled sounding voice and mild swelling of his left posterior tongue 10 minutes later. At this point, 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered.  Symptoms rapidly improved with treatment. EMS was contacted for transfer to the ER for further treatment as indicated and close observation.

                                                Patient received Moderna vaccine after review. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine they came to the drop off area stating that they felt warm and the lights seemed brighter. They explained they didn&#39;t know if it was just a random feeling or a reaction to the vaccine. I had them sit down, gave them an ice pak and cold bottled water, advised that they stay longer (around 30 minutes total) After about 10 minutes the patient felt better but they stayed the wait time. I called to check on them in the afternoon but they did not answer

He showed photos of his arm with a circle around what appeared to be an injection in the front part of the deltoid muscle area. Patient related that he visited FNP (noted in this report) for evaluation within a few days of the shot. Per patient history, he declined imaging or other scans and elected to treat symptomatically using Naproxen. Per patient, symptoms subsided after a couple of weeks to the point range of motion generally returned but soreness remains. Patient desired to receive his second dose to complete series which was administered.

                                                The evening of Wednesday I began feeling chest pressure/discomfort and slight difficulty breathing. The same on Thursday, but a little worse. Friday morning at 4:30am I awoke from intense pain and pressure in my chest, difficulty breathing, and back/shoulder/neck pain. I went to the ER at 7:30 in the morning. Had tests taken, was given colchicine to help with the pain, and it did help lower the pain level a little bit. By Noon the pain was tolerable enough that I could go home. I was told to take ibuprofen to manage the pain. I took a nap but awoke at 2:30pm, this time with even more intense pain, my back/neck/shoulder muscles convulsing/twitching from pain and from being in a state of involuntary clenching as well as chest pain/pressure and difficulty breathing. I went back to the ER and after several more tests, an ECG gave the doctors cause to worry about the health of my heart (they were concerned I may be having a heart attack or heart failure). They kept me overnight and after taking more blood tests and ECG tests were able to diagnose me with Pericarditis on Saturday morning. I was prescribed colchicine, which I am to take twice a day for three months and ibuprofen to manage the pain.

                                                pupils underwent myosis for several hours after the injection before returning to normal dialation rates. (not sure if this was a side effect or just a shock response to foreign matterials entering the body)  localized soreness in arm for a few days. worse second day than first.  chemical taste in mouth resembling isopropyl alcohol for about an hour or so, starting about 30 minutes after recieving vaccine, i assume this was just some of the sterilizing agent entering the body and getting circulated.  mild head fog in the days following the shot, this seems to have mostly gone away and i cant say with certainty if it is a side effect or was caused by some other factor such as stress.  mood disturbance / depression starting the day of the shot, this one might be completely unrelated, I attended a funeral of a family friend on that day which seems a reasonably likely cause for such, im just listing it because I want to be concise with my reporting of what Ive been experiencing.  mild headache behind the temple on the right side of my head, and behind both eyes.  heightened reaction to concrete allergy, not sure what exactly in concrete/cement i am allegric too possible nickel or chromates as pomphlox seems to fit the description, this has been recurrent for years but after recieving the vaccine a ring of hives formed on my left hand and my feet were the most broken out theyve ever been, i worked with cement 1 day after recieving the shot.  a relatively consistent feeling of coldness, since getting the shot ive felt abnormally cold, sometimes feeling the need for wearing a coat in 80&#43; degree weather. this is completely abnormal, typically i could wear a tshirt in 50°F weather and a hooded sweatshirt would suffice down into the 20s.  persistent joint pain in almost every joint of my body and the surrounding muscles, feels like it may be in the cartilidge or connective tissue, occasional pains had been experienced before and considered a normal part of life, but this has been relatively constant like an inflammatory response.  sleep cycle disturbance, normally i had abnormal sleeping habbits where being awake for 24&#43; hours at a time wasnt particularly uncommon (oddly this one seemingly gets worse when i stop drinking caffinated drinks), and it was impossible for me to get to sleep prior to like 2-3 am most nights followed by  sleeping for around 4-10 hours a night on average. however since recieving the shot ive been sleeping a lot more than this and at strange times (for me) like the middle of the afternoon.  fever/constant headache on the side the injection was recieved on has set in after about 2weeks and has been terrible, ive had to take ibuprophen for two days just to function, mild visual hallucinations have also occured in the past couple days mostly spatial distortions where the depth perception isnt working properly, and framerate issues where objects in motion leave a trail momentarily.

Confirmed with pt that he had no problem with 1st vaccination of covid. Right after the vacciation of 2nd shot, pt told me he was feeling dizzy, sweating, and warm. He told me actually he is afraid of needles so he is not feeling nervse. Stay in the vaccination room wit hpt for about 5 to 10 min. pt felt better after 5 to 10 min. Have pt stay for additional 15min after, he stated he was totally fine now and thanks for my help.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

Similar symptoms to L 5th toe and R great toe. As days progressed it got more diffuse and extended up to mid-calf that was very mild... eventually by day 10 it dissipated, thank god.  To add I also experienced L facial dull pain and the distal portion of my tounge felt like I burnt it (lasted 5 -7 days)

Rash is red, raised, hive-like and itches/burns mildly. Overall reaction moderate in severity and appearance. No anaphylaxis experienced.

                                                -On 1/11/21 at 930AM los angeles time, I received the COVID19 Moderna vaccine. At about 1030AM I had a very bad headache and was extremely nauseous for about 3 hours and felt like vomiting but did not vomit. This went away at about 1230pm and I felt my tongue get cold and a metallic taste which went away within the hour of onset. The nausea, headache, and metallic taste was gone at about 1-2pm on 1/11/21. I had a sore left arm on the injection site, which is to be expected and went away within 3 days. On 1/18/21 around 1pm, my arm started to feel itchy at the exact site of the injection from 1/11/21, and there is now (1/18/21) a red rash like appearance on that left arm where the Moderna covid vaccine was injected. Possible delayed local allergic reaction.

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night with a fever, took 400mg of ibuprofen to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I felt mostly normal, so I took my Bupropion dose (150mg) and drank a cup of coffee. I exercised and went to the gym. When I got back I noticed my heart rate while resting was 130. This persisted into the night. I felt tired, weak, unfocused, and cold at night again. It is possible I had a slight fever again. 48 hrs after my second vaccine, I still have a high resting heart rate (90) which goes up to 120 whenever I move. It is as though I am exercising. I feel like I could jump up and run at any moment. I do not feel fatigued today thankfully. The high heart rate with fatigue is what worried me most.

                                                I developed periumbilicus cramping abdominal pain, nausea for two days after first shot then it went away. After second shot, I developed the usual thing of arm soreness, fever, chills, joint pain and generalized body aches as well as GI symptoms. All symptoms went away in two days except that I have had persistent symptoms of cramping abdominal pain, on/off nausea, bloating. I still have the symptoms 4 weeks after the shot and nobody knows what is going on.  I lost around 15 lb till now and will be following with my PCP soon to see what is next.

All other symptoms experienced following severe symptoms more closely resembling flu-like symptoms that are to be expected following second vaccine.

I woke up around 6:30 with a headache and chills. throughout the morning, my headache worsened as did my chills. I felt fatigued and noticed my lungs felt the same as they did when I had COVID. Essentially all my COVID symptoms came back I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I slept most of the morning and then felt nauseous around 3 pm. I vomited around 3:30 and almost felt completely better after that. My headache, chills, and fatigue were still present but significantly less once I vomited. In the morning I woke up with a headache that lasted through the morning the second day after vaccine administration. By the end of the second day, I felt completely fine. My arm soreness was almost completely gone. I also had some aches and chills on the second day in the morning upon waking up but those were gone by mid-day. On day three I feel completely fine.

                                                Approximately two to three minutes after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, my face began feeling flush. I also felt a tingling sensation in my face and neck, and I began sweating profusely. I walked up to one of the rescue/paramedic staffers and told them that I had a &#34;flush&#34; feeling in my face. The paramedic asked me a few questions about how I was feeling, then a second paramedic brought a wheelchair. I sat in the wheelchair and was brought to a separate room. The second paramedic noted that I was covered in sweat. The second paramedic and I decided to remove the top layer of my clothing (a polo shirt) because it was drenched in sweat. After about 10 or 15 minutes of sitting in the wheelchair and focusing on my breathing, the tingling/sweating sensation subsided and I was able to walk back into the observation area. I felt a second &#34;wave&#34; of sweating/tingling come over me a few minutes later, but it was minor compared to the first &#34;wave,&#34; and did not require additional attention from the paramedics. I did not require any medication during this event.

When asked to elaborate he said he was a little dizzy,  was having some difficulty breathing and &#34;rubbery legs&#34; at this point RN 2  discussed with pt that clinic staff feels more comfortable having him evaluated for continued chest tightness and new SOB. Pt agreed to that.     1416 Requested EMS through Deputy.    1424 EMS was on site.  EMS evaluated the patient and decided to transport him to the hospital for further evaluation.

If he gets another dose of the vaccine he plans to do it at an allergists office.

                                                2 days after receiving my first dose my tongue began to feel tingly and swell, I could feel the tightness in the back and in my lymph nodes as well. I began to have sensitivity to spicy foods on Thursday. On Friday I woke up and my words were slurring as my tongue felt more swollen  and I started to notice some slight swelling in my throat, maybe 5%. I started gargling diphenhydramine on Friday night and that helped a lot, I also took loratadine and Fexofenadine. By Sunday my symptoms were masked by the allergy drugs and I stopped taking the diphenhydramine. 1 week later, 12 days post Moderna Vaccinne I stopped taking the fexofenadine and Loratadine. I continued to have tongue irritation and a sore on my tongue for 2.5 weeks. I then had an adverse event after the 2nd shot as well.

                                                I premedicated with Diphenhydramine, fexofenadine and loratadine as suggested by the urgent clinic from my previous adverse event. 10 minutes after the 2nd shot I felt hot flashes in my L glut region, then 15 minutes  in I started to feel tongue swelling and slight throat swelling (maybe 10-20%). I felt this decrease but was still present 25 minutes after the shot, I notified a rep at the nurses tent. They asked some questions and said they could take me into the tent but that if I felt it was improving to just wait 15 more minutes, I did that and left after. I continued to have some tongue swelling the next day and continued taking all 3 antihistamines for maybe 3 days. I previously had sensitivity to spicy foods and my tongue feeling inflamed but not swollen from the previous shot, this again occurred the 2nd time. I maintained this with gradual dissipation of symptoms until about 3/1/21. I believe all my symptoms were resolved at that point.

                                                I have not felt the same since I received the vaccine. Initially, I felt tingling in my fingers after receiving the injection. I also got chest and throat tightness. I felt very slightly shaky and just a bit off.  After that subsided a bit, I left the facility and started heading home. Ten miles from the store, I went back as I got another wave of feeling pretty terrible. I waited outside there for another hour until I felt better again. The next few days I had terrible fatigue and constant headaches, and the obvious sore arm. I had a couple days where I was a little better but then it would come surging back again.  For three weeks I&#39;ve had on and off migraines, extreme and dreadful fatigue like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before (feels like I&#39;m dying of cancer or something), and feeling out of it and spacey. It&#39;s been awful and I&#39;m terrified to get the second dose if the first one did all this to me. I was feeling great in the weeks leading up to the vaccine so I am certain that my reaction is to the vaccine. I hope this gets better soon. I&#39;m not sure what to do about dose 2.

The  night after my second dose, I had cold/night sweats and completely drenched the bed. This occurred three nights in a row. The morning after the shot I also woke up with a 102.5 degree fever, but the fever went away shortly after I woke up. Additionally, I also experienced severe headaches and exhaustion for about two to three days after the injection. On the fourth day, all the adverse side effects dissipated and eventually went away completely.

The warmness lasted 2-3 minutes, and then he felt cool. The lightheadedness subsided about 10:15 AM. This is when his mother called me over and told me what was going on. His BP (using automatic cuff) was 110/58 with a pulse of 55. He denied any other sx, and said he ate Special K Protein and soy milk for breakfast. We gave him a bottle of water to sip, and he continued to sit with his head near his knees. At 10:30 AM, his BP was 101/56 with pulse of 51. He said the lightheadedness returned slightly, but the sweatiness subsided. By 10:43 AM, he said he felt all better. At 10:36 AM, he took his pulse manually, and it was 66. By 10:43 AM, he felt &#34;all better&#34; and his BP was 135/75 at 10:54 AM, with a pulse of 57 (per automatic cuff).

                                                I received the shot in my left arm. Two things happened upon injection (1) I immediately began to bleed from the injection site. I have been told the provider may have hit a capillary; it bled for about 45 seconds. (2) within 20 seconds of injection I felt faint and began to sweat; this was rather short and subsided within 2-3 minutes. I was concerned that because I began to bleed immediately after injection that the vaccine may have also been expelled, too. But given the following reaction just described and the soreness I continue to feel in my arm, I assume the vaccine was successfully injected. The shot provider was surprised at the bleeding, as was I, but unsure of the exact reasoning behind it.

                                                On March 18, 2021 the patient started experiencing right-sided tongue numbness and loss of taste. It progressed to his face tingling and feeling sore. This went on for a week or so and progressed to absolute right-sided face numbness and face droop from forehead to neck.  Patient&#39;s mother is a registered nurse and conducted a full stroke assessment on him with no findings indicating stroke at all.  Patient saw his dentist between the time symptoms started and the full face droop happened thinking maybe he had something going on in his mouth and the dentist didn&#39;t find any issues, even with an x-ray. The patient went and saw a physician and was prescribed antibiotics in case he had an abscess that wasn&#39;t seen on the x-ray because everything was tingling, numb, or hurting in his mouth at this point. When the right-sided face droop happened, he went back to the physician and was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy.

                                                I had the vaccine that month 3 weeks earlier, and had a 24 hour fever and 48 hour cough. Heart palpitations followed after the vaccine.   The main issue of me reporting this is that I had leg pain when I had the 2nd vaccine shot including the above fever, cough, and heart palpitations. I didn&#39;t report this to a doctor because I took aspirin for a week and it went away. Plus i&#39;m a man so I am stubborn as hell. But seeing the need to report if symptoms arise from what I saw in a article, I thought I should do so.

                                                At 11:08 patient slumped down in chair and stated &#34;oh no, here it goes.&#34; Patient lost consciousness at 11:09am.  I continued to speak to him and he was unable to hear initially.  He did cry out and gasp and tighten then started to have a few slow jerky movements bringing both arms and body up from the chair. It appeared as if he may vomit and I repositioned to ensure he would not slide off of the chair.  The movements lasted about a minute and then he started to come to.  He described feeling dizzy, disoriented, nauseous, and sweaty.  During the event his pupils were non responsive. At 11:17 he went pale and started feeling as if he was spinning and experiencing tingling.  He was still reclined in the chair and sitting up aided with the tingling.  He was given a cold pack to help regulate and given ice water at 11:18.  He stated he had not eaten yet today as he usually doesn&#39;t eat until 11. His temperature had dropped to 96.1 vs 97.5 prior to the vaccination.  BP was checked at 11:25 and was 120/72 which is lower than usual for him and to be expected with the LOC.  After drinking his water, I had him attempt to stand while grasping the wall/table for 2 minutes to assess his steadiness, then standing unassisted for 2 minutes.  After he felt steady enough we had him walk 10-15 feet and stand for another 2 minutes.  Patient was feeling tired and instructed not to drive home.  The situation was conveyed to his wife and they were instructed to seek ER/Urgent care if any of his symptoms reappeared. They stayed in the area to eat lunch and I checked in again at 12:12pm with the patient and he is feeling better after eating but still tired.  I also recommended following up with his primary as I will be sending her a copy of this report.

                                                Started feeling extremely dizzy and shaking while driving home. Felt the need to pull over, but didn?t have time before losing consciousness. Ended up crashing car and being flown via life flight to a hospital trauma unit. Fortunately for seat belts and air bags, no serious injuries had occurred.

Five minutes after vaccination, mother noticed the patient was pale on forehead, followed by &#34;overall paleness&#34; a minute later. Patient reports feeling slightly light-headed five minutes post-vaccination. He said he also felt warm and slightly sweaty. Eight minutes post-vaccination, his mother said his earlobe &#34;lost color&#34;. The patient reported feeling cool and sweaty around this time and still light-headed. 19 minutes post vaccination (at 10:06 AM), patient informed me of how he was feeling, and I checked his blood pressure. It was 93/47, with a pulse of 55. He felt very hot to the touch, but his temp was 96.8 degrees. He brought a water bottle to sip water as needed, and he was given a cool cloth for his neck/forehead. At 10:10 AM, patient reported feeling weak and didn&#39;t want to talk. At 10:13 AM (~25 min post vaccination), patient reported feeling a &#34;bit better&#34;, and his BP was 104/57 (checked by other RPh). 34 minutes post-vaccination he reported feeling much better and was much less light-headed/able to talk. At 10:26 AM (~39 min post-vaccination), BP was 137/75, and his pulse was 60. 42 minutes post-vaccination, he said he was &#34;mostly back to normal; ~90%&#34;. Then, 46 minutes post-vaccination, he said he was 95% better, and he said he was &#34;good to go&#34; 51 minutes post-vaccination.

When I tried to speak with him he wasn&#39;t answering. I then ran to his side and by the time I was there he had passed out (eyes were open and rolling to the back of his head and he was not responsive). I told my technician to call 911 and went to grab the epinephrine and emergency kit while a customer stayed next to him. He came to within a minute and I did not need to administer epinephrine, etc. He said he was okay but we called EMS, who then took over and patient decided to go with them to ambulance/ER.

                                                I started feeling woozy maybe 30 minutes after injection. I ended up taking a big nap when I got home and woke up feeling sick. Had dinner, went to bed for the night.  I was not able to sit up straight for more than 2 minutes the next day without getting extremely light headed. I did not eat for two and a half days. Spent the next several nights freezing cold and with night sweats. I also had a deep, phlegmy cough. It all started clearing up after a few days, but I felt crummy/under the weather for a week.

I had my staff call 911 and the store management.  After about 30 seconds he became responsive and I asked him what his name was, what day it was and where he was at.  He answered all correctly.  He had no memory of the inicident.  EMT&#39;s arrived to evaluate him.  He had a slightly low blood pressure but no other findings.  Pt refused to go to HCF.

Patient was tensing up and unresponsive (looked like a mini-seizure). Patient peed on himself and after 3-4 seconds patient was fully responsive. Patient stated he was fine and didn&#39;t know what happened. Patient did not want me to call an ambulance and person with him told me not to call. We waited a little longer, patient complained of feeling really hot. He laid down on the floor and I gave him some water and a lollipop to increase sugar levels. After 3-5 minutes patient sat down on the chair and stated he was feeling much better. After a few minutes, he complained of wanting to vomit. As soon as I was able to give him a bag, he violently threw up. Patient stated that he was now feeling much better. He went to the bathroom and cleaned up. After a little longer observation, patient said he was fine and wanted to go home. They left. I called patient an hour later and he stated he felt fine and was just resting. Will follow up with patient tomorrow.

Woke up several other times throughout the night with sweats and chills. Headache and body fatigue lasted for about 36 hours.  Arm/should pain lasted for about 72 hours post injection.  Occasional shooting arm pain all the way down to hand, especially during movements. Was painful to raise arm above head and outwards (away from shoulder). Ice was applied several times and did help in the short term. After about 72 hours arm/should pain subsided.   Overall I have fully recovered and those adverse effects are no longer present.

                                                Almost exactly 1 week after getting the first Moderna shot, I woke up and had hives on my lower arms and hands. The next day it spread to my feet, ankles and knees. The next day it was on my thighs, arm pits and groin. The fourth and fifth days it didnt seem to spread anymore, but it was quite uncomfortable. Avoided alcohol and sunlight/heat as much as possible, but I do work in a hot warehouse. Very itchy. One spot on my foot &#34;broke open&#34; and was stuck on my sock, but soaking in luke-warm/cold oatmeal bath helped a lot overall. I did not start taking Benadryl until the third day, I believe. Benadryl seemed to really help after a couple of days. I am a smoker, but no respiratory problems. It is now 13 days after the dose and they are still lingering, but just as a red rash/spots. I have had an abnormally large amount of stress the past few weeks, as I am sure that has been adding to it. From what I&#39;ve seen online, it is almost like shingles. I do not have a PCP in Indianapolis, so I have not seen anyone about it. The strangest part is that they are almost a mirror image on my body. Every one of the spots is practically identical on either side.

Acute onset (minutes) developed full body ?pins and needles? and numbness especially prominent in hands, feet, and sides of neck. Bilateral. Acute symptoms lasted approximately 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, acute symptoms improved but followed immediately by chills, extreme lethargy, and flushing of face. I was disoriented (?dazed?) for approximately  3 hours after episode. I was in a remote area and was not able to present to medical care by the time symptoms subsided.

                                                I woke up the morning after my second dose experiencing  the common symptoms related to the vaccine -- persistent headache, body ache, fever, cold shivers, and fatigue. These symptoms lasted for approximately 24 hours, and I continued to have a headache for a total of approximately 48 hours.   However, I then developed pain in my left calf approximately 10 days after the second dose and on three consecutive evenings at approximately 9pm I developed an all-body itchy rash (big red raised welts) that would disappear by the time I woke up the next morning. The rash only occurred on these three evenings, but the pain in my calf persisted. I went to see my primary care doctor the following Monday (05/17/21) who gave me a referral for an ultrasound to rule out a DVT, although he said that it was not urgent that I go as I didn&#39;t have the other regular symptoms of a DVT (swelling, redness, warm to the touch) and I was too young and healthy to be at risk for one. My doctor said that if the pain didn&#39;t subside by the end of the week I should go for the ultrasound. The pain got worse and so I went for an ultrasound on Saturday (05/22/2021). I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH A BLOOD CLOT (DVT), and sent to the emergency department.

                                                The day after vaccination, I experienced fever, chills, muscle aches, and a sore arm. Symptoms lasted approximately 24 hours, and were self-resolving.  Early in 2020, I was diagnosed with Covid-19 infection. The severity of the symptoms from the vaccine were just as intense as the infection; however, the duration was significantly shorter.

                                                After the individual received his vaccine he went to the medical monitoring area with two additional members of his party.  At approximately 1412 the individuals friends alerted me that he needs help. I walked approximately 40 feet to find a 33 year old male patient that was unconscious and seizing.  The seizure lasted about 20-30 seconds with the patient waking up confused. I instructed someone from my team to call 911 and request an  ambulance.  Another team member and myself assisted the patient to a wheelchair and moved him to our treatment area approximately 50 feet away.  The patient was somewhat confused, hot &amp; sweaty and fatigued.  I took a basic set of vital signs and got: BP 90/70 Pulse 56 Respirations 22 LOC x 4 No CBG  The ambulance arrived within 10 minuets and another round of vitals were taken.  The patients blood pressure and pulse were still low.  A CBG of 120 was achieved.  The patient was still hot / sweaty and fatigued.  The patient lied down on a cot and soon started feeling better.  He stopped sweating and his BP / Pulse started rising to within normal limits.  The two paramedics on site conducted a 12 lead ECG and didn&#39;t notice any amoralities.  Due to this incident being the first of its kind for the patient and without being a able to find a definitive known cause it was recommended that the patient be transported to the local hospital for further evaluation.  The patient declined and stated that he would have his friends take him if he starting feeling really bad.   It was strongly advised that he be transported via medics to the hospital but in the end the patient refused.

                                                Approximately 4 weeks after receiving the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, patient experienced tingling and loss of muscle control on one side of his face.  He presented to Emergency department and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy.  The ED was not concerned that he had received the vaccine 4 weeks earlier and dismissed it as a coincidence.     Family and I decided it would be a good idea to report here just in case there is a pattern with other people.

I rested for 2 days with the fever reaching its peak at 101.7 and a cough starting on Saturday but the sore throat ending when the cough started. Oddly those 2 symptoms did not overlap. It&#39;s now Sunday.  Fever is down to 99.7 and I&#39;m coughing up alot of flem but otherwise fine

                                                I recieved my second covid 19 vaccine by moderna.  I still have the subtle altered taste/smell that occured after receiving the first dose a month ago (I have previously reported that).  On 1/25/21, I recieved the 2nd dose of vaccine at 10 am and felt fine all day.  Around 10pm, I started to have chills.  This rapidly evolved to whole body rigors.  My tempature spiked.  I couldn&#39;t move, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would pass out or throw up.  I had to have my wife bring me a makeshift urinal since I couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Went from freezing to boiling, back and forth.  Felt absolutely miserable.  Around 2-3 am broke out into a cold sweat and finally started to feel better.  I was drenched in sweat througout the night.  It was a very long 4-5 hours.  The following night I felt fine although I also was drenched in sweat when I woke up.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

Finished a conversation at left the facility after approximately 9:55am. While driving back to office (appx 5 minute drive total), experienced clammy skin, sweating at 3 minutes into drive.  I considered pulling over, though I knew I should be around people where I could be monitored, so continued on. Experienced elevated temperature, blurriness of vision and my vision began to turn bright and white.  As I pulled into the parking lot, I thought I may be passing out.  I got out of the vehicle, sat down on the nearest bench and asked two individuals who where outside to stay with me, and I explained my symptoms to them.  I remained seated for approximately 10 minutes, and when I felt the symptoms subside, went into my office and am now filing this report.

                                                Inflammation started on the right and left sides of my neck two days after the shot. The pain was dull and lasted for about two days. The pain then moved to the middle of my back at the spine and blades of my lower back shoulders. The pain has lasted for a little over a week now and has lessened over time but is still noticeable. If I tried to sneeze or inhale deeply, this was difficult due to the discomfort I felt in my back and the sides of my neck.

                                                I had three symptoms: First, 4 days after the injection, the glands in my armpit were swollen and painful. It was a mild pain that lasted 3 days. Second, 7 days after vaccination, itchy and hot area of hives developed around the injection spot and slowly grew  into a 6 inch circle. Third, at the same time with the second symptom, I am having a mild sciatic pain in my right leg.  Symptom 1 has subsided, and symptoms 2 and 3 are still present, but seem to have slowed down.

                                                Within 20 minutes of receiving shot, I started having warm rushing sensations on left calf. Over the next few days it traveled to my foot and left arm. Also started developing tingling, pins and needles sensations, numbness and weakness in left leg, foot, forearm and hand. Have experienced prolonged periods of time with muscle spasms in left calf sometimes up to 2 days in length.  A combination of all of these symptoms happen daily. Have had muscle fatigue in right arm and neck at different times Have developed a metallic taste in mouth over the last 2 weeks. After the first 5 days developed extreme mental fatigue and grogginess that lasted 7 days and can sometimes reappear.

                                                Right below the syringe insertion point around 6&#43; inches long and around 5&#43; inches wide skin got first turned red and then black. Later on, balloon-type blisters appeared. later majority of that skin peeled off and new pinkish skin surfaced. The entire feeling was like skin burn after boiling oil spill. I could not drive because hand movement or muscle pressure caused pain, leading to unable to sleep on the left side and let people touch my arm. Still, after the new skin, my arm shows many signs of ugly spots and marks and discoloration. It&#39;s mental trauma going through it. Over the period of 15&#43; days applying Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream helped.

                                                I woke up and my arm slept sore - I thought I slept wrong. It was about 4 inches by two inches - a red welt (warm to the touch - raised a little) where I got the injection. It felt very sore. I called my doctor - by the next day, when I had the doctor appt,  the red mark was pretty much not visible. The Doctor could see a little bit of it but it was nothing comparable to the previous day. Doctor told me to monitor it.

                                                Mildly swollen red splotches/bumps on several fingers (and underside of left big toe). Only mildly itchy unless scratched - then they become extremely itchy with burning sensation. Skin issues still present, but discomfort relieved by antihistamine (generic Zyrtec). Ibuprofen/lotion/etc had no effect. I believe it was a delayed vaccine reaction because I?ve never needed antihistamines before in my entire life - no known ?true allergies? (just significant GI issues with eurythromycin, so I avoid it).

The feeling was uncomfortable, so I stood up to walk around. After 15 seconds, I felt very nauseous as weak. Hey went to sit back down, but felled while trying to sit. I was able to sit back up and started to shake/shiver and sweat heavily. This happen for over 15 minutes, than it felt as it was coming and going.(the side effects) for the next 40 minutes, I felt very weak and stiff in the left arm.  After another 20 minutes, I started to feel better/normal. My arm started to feel less stiff.  Waited another hour and half total before discharged from the clinic.

This left us uncertain what volume he had received.  We were able to bring the patient back in round 2 hours later and administered another 0.4ml in the other arm.  Over the next few days, he had routine post-shot side effects (sore arms x 2, fatigue) but was otherwise well.

RPH on duty observed patient for another 30 minutes until 1:15PM. Per patient, he only had a small breakfast and a kombucha in the morning. He also has history of fainting/anxiousness from vaccine about 20 years ago, and another fainting history while he was taking an exam. Patient mentioned he was very anxious prior to receiving the shot. Patient doesn&#39;t have any medical history and is not taking any medications or other illicit drugs. Patient lives by himself so he doesn&#39;t have anyone to watch over him when he goes home and at 1:15PM. Patient stated he still feels dizzy, nausea, and arm tingling. Front end manager called 911/Ambulance, medics arrived around 1:20PM. blood glucose, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen were checked. Medics also checked patient?s memory (asked what day it was, what year, who the president is, etc). Medics told patient that he can decide the following options:   1: to have family/friend to come pick him up and take him home OR 2: they can take him to nearby hospital for checkup. Patient lives alone so he decided to go to the hospital to have check up to &#34;make him feel better&#34;.  Patient was transported to the hospital around 1:37 PM. Both RPh on duty and front end managers were at the scene the whole time. Patient seemed to be in full command of his faculties and was following instructions at time of departure.

                                                34 YO male patient with no past medical history presents with sudden stroke-like symptoms including right sided arm and leg weakness, numbness, slurred speech and facial droop.  Symptoms lasted for roughly 45 minutes.  Suspected CVA.  MRI done in hospital was found to be consistent with microinfarcts in the left hemisphere of the brain, mostly along the cortical ribbon with a single lesion in the left parasagittal/lateral pons.  Full neuro and cardio workup is currently being done. ECHO w/ bubble study was weakly positive and plans are for TEE today.  Otherwise, no exact cause identified and few risk factors. Found out that the patent was taking no medications prior and had no past medical history and was otherwise a 34 YO healthy male, who received their first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 4/22.  3 days later the patient had this event.  The timing of everything makes me report this as the potential is there that this is a  vaccine ADE and plausible reason for this thrombotic event.

At 12:30pm, the patient hit his head on the wall in the waiting room, slumped down in his chair, and began seizing for approximately 30 seconds. He, then, woke up, sat up in the chair and did not know what happened.  The last thing he remembered was getting his shot.  The medics arrived and finished the discussion with the patient.  He remained in the waiting  room for a bit, and felt better in about 30 minutes.

                                                Prior to vaccination the patient reported that in the past he had passed out after giving blood. About a minute after administering the COVID-19 vaccine the patient reported feeling dizzy. He then passed out in the chair. We safely moved the patient to the floor. Then within approximately 15 seconds the patient sat up and then stood up on his own. We asked the patient to then be seated in the chair while he recovered. We called 911 as soon as he passed out. Patient was somewhat confused initially but quickly regained his bearings. He began sweating and said he was very hot. We checked his blood pressure and it was 100/80. Patient continued to recover and said he was feeling better. We had him wait until EMTs arrived. He told them he did not need any care. We took his blood pressure again and it was now 110/75. He said he felt well to go to the EMTs and pharmacist.

I went to be around 11pm.  Upon laying down I began to get dizzy and my heart began to pound rapidly.  This strong heart pounding would last 5 hours straight. An hour later my throat started to get a tight feeling with tingling under the chin area and my saliva production began to slow drying out my mouth.  Breathing became more labored and difficult.  At this time my heart was still beating strong.  I had intense Insomnia.  The one time that I tried to lay down; when my body would try to doze off for a second; my body would suddenly jolt me awake with an intense shaking and heart pounding.

I was in bed for 5 weeks with most of the symptoms and regularly had fever exceeding 104. When I was allowed to return to work, the Dr. gave me light duty orders to not exceed 5 hours worked per day for 2 months.  After receiving the first vaccination dose, my arm became incredibly sore. These symptoms lasted for almost 2 weeks.   The morning following vaccination, my body began to ache and hurt on touch to the point where the cover woke me up in pain. These symptoms lasted nearly three days during both day and night.   I became nauseous about 24 hours following the vaccination. These symptoms lasted almost 4, 24 hour days.   I became dizzy, periodically, about 24 hours after receiving the vaccination.  These symptoms lasted for almost 7 days.   I had low grade fever on three occasions that I knew about, I treated with Tylenol.  These symptoms lasted 3 days after vaccination.   I had a horrible headache (I never have had headaches before) I could not open my eyes or expose them to light. Most of the pain was concentrated on the left side of my head. These headaches started 3 days after receiving the vaccination and lasted 5 days later until day 8. I used Tylenol, which seemed to have little effect and slept all day.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving inject patient reported feeling light headed and tunnel vision. Patient appeared pale, and his head was nodding backward. 911 was called. I checked his pulse, and breathing which were both normal. Patient started to gradually lose consciousness and confused speech, but was roused by me asking him questions, to which he responded and shaking his shoulder. Patient gradually began to regain color and normal speech returned. Patient stated that he was panicked and is afraid of needles and worked him self up after receiving the vaccine.

The fever gave me chills and I needed to put on lots of warm clothes to stop the chills which were preventing me from sleeping.  The fever broke after about 2 hours.  All night, though, sleep was interrupted.  I woke up every hour or 2, looked at the clock, and hoped I could fall back asleep again.  Got up at 8:30 am, feeling tired.  Was tired all day and unable to do my daily activities.  Had to rest all day.  Finally, the following day (2 days after getting the shot), after a good night of sleep, I felt like myself again and had my energy back.

The following day was the worst of the symptoms.  The pins and needles was somewhat painful.  Overall mainly an annoyance and didn&#39;t prevent me from completing any of my daily activities.  While sitting, when feeling another jab I&#39;d need to reposition to try to get comfortable.  These jabs happened at least every 5-10 minutes.  The following day symptoms subsided, more like what was happening on day 3.  By day 6 symptoms were gone.

By 130am 1/1/2021 I awoke from my sleep terribly dizzy, shaking violently and experiencing a fever of 101.3 F. I took advil and tylenol and fell asleep about an hour later. I woke up with similar symptoms at approximately 830am on 1/1/2021 took an additional dose of advil and tylenol and slept till 12p. I woke up with a bad headache and coughing fits similar to when I had covid back in March. I went to an urgent care who assessed me and ordered me to the ER. medical center administered IV fluids, an inhaler, steroids, epinephrine and benadryl and a few hours later my symptoms had subsided for the most part and a dose of IV antibiotics was administered. I am currently admitted for observation with likely discharge on 1/2/2021.

                                                Slight numbness on the left side of my face, starting somewhere around a half an hour to an hour after injection. It is now 28 hours after receiving the vaccine and the numbness is still present but milder than this time yesterday. Additionally, there was a very slight sensation of tightness in my throat that has almost completely subsided.

Felt better during the 15 minute waiting period but 10 minutes after felt bad. 1 hour after vaccine had an allergic reaction similar to his shellfish allergy: pale, tachycardia, itchy face, dizzy with blackspots and took Benadryl. Denies SOB and airway closing. Denies any reactions to other vaccine. Next dose scheduled for 1/29. As per CDC recommendations, he may get the 2nd dose of vaccine but will advise to stay for at least 30 minutes to monitor for symptoms.

I went to the hospital and was admitted to start IVIG treatment for Guillain Barre Syndrome/AIDP.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine first dose. Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, i became dizzy, tachycardic and experiencing hot flashes. Me thinking it was in my head did not say anything i waited the 15 minutes and left the vaccination area. The feeling i got seemed to go away and i thought everything was good and was my way home.  About 30 minutes after injection i began experiencing itching in the face, nausea, dizziness, i was pale as a ghost. Having felt this before it was just like my allergic reaction i get when i ingest shellfish. I stupidly continued on my way home when i should have went to an ER but nonetheless i made it home and took some benedryl about 30 minutes later my symptoms subsided. I also took my blood pressure when i arrived home and was hypotensive. By the next day was fully recovered and no problems since day of injection.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                Around 12 hours after the second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine I experienced the expected severe fever, chills, and rigors.  This eventually subsided to a large extent by hour 30; however at hour 36 I slightly bent over to pick up an item from my nightstand and felt what seemed to be a pulled muscle in my left back.  I immediately went to bed and awoke with severe muscle spasms in that same area.  The muscle spasms continued lying, standing, and sitting.  Nothing relieved them and they were intermittent brought on spontaneously and also by movement.  I could not perform most daily functions and sought medical attention at the local urgent care.  There they diagnosed it as a thoracic myofascial strain.  They prescribed me cyclobenzaprine which helped decrease the frequency but not completely alleviate the spasms.

                                                At about 10 minutes post injection I began feeling dizzy, lightheaded and hot. Left arm began itching. Discovered hives on my upper arm. 15 minutes later hives had spread to my left shoulder and neck. Paramedics on site gave me a fimotadine tablet and a benedryl injection, juice, water and monitored me. 20 minutes later there was no improvement, they gave another benedryl injection. Dizziness persisted. Hives began to resolve. 40 minutes later they permitted me to leave but said I could not drive, because the dizziness persisted. Advised me to take a benedryl tablet by mouth before bed and again in the morning and to follow up with my PCP.

My right side of my face around the cheek, eye, and ear area began to tingle and feel numb around 20 to 30 min. After the shot was administered. It was only on the side of my face that Moderna covid vaccine was given. It ended up going away after 4 hours or so. The next day I had normal reactions to the shot for someone that had covid such as low fever, muscle inflammation, aches, and this brain fog, chills in my sleep.

                                                An employee received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on 01/28/2021. This store had entered and scanned the patient&#39;s VAR into the system. On 02/11/2021, the patient was called into our store location to receive his second dose, even though it was 14 days too early. The patient&#39;s VAR and vaccine was not immediately entered into the system, so the fact that the patient had received the first dose only 14 days ago was not immediately discovered. On 2-12-2021, our team was entering the patient&#39;s vaccine into the system and this was when the error was caught. Patient was contacted and instructed to call the nurse triage line. So far, the patient has only reported normal vaccine-related side effects such as sore arm, malaise, fatigue, and sweating.

                                                I was working on a fence about 5-5:30 pm and suddenly developed blurry vision. I continued working for another 5-10 minutes, then I went inside for dinner with my wife kids and in-laws. I complained I couldn?t see in my periphial  to my wife and mother n law.  I  ate dinner, salad and spaghetti. While eating my brother in law asked if I got a new car and that he hadn?t see the white one before. I tried to tell him what happened to my old car but got caught and couldn?t think clearly about the old car, the problems it had and the story.  After dinner I want out to help on the fence again and my son was handing  my brother in law boards and I tried to tell him the board wasn?t cut with a bevel yet. But couldn?t come up with any words to describe the board. I went to my wife explained my  that my brain wasn?t working right and I clearly had a problem. I developed some tingling in my right hand. She took me to  local ER referenced. My symptoms subsided on their own and they weren?t able to see anything on a cat scan. As I felt better I didn?t take the next step to the larger ER with and MRI.

                                                Patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  After 5 minutes of sitting, he decided to walk around the store to shop.  The patient experienced syncope and fell face first to the floor, cutting his lip.  The patient was bleeding from his lips.  Customers and pharmacy technicians tended to the patient.  He was alert and responsive the entire time.  The pharmacist called 911 and an EMS team was dispatched.  The patient rose and sat in a chair.  He was given water.  He stated that he just felt overheated and that the store was very warm.  EMS arrived, evaluated the patient, and stated that the patient just experienced a bout of syncope.  They asked if the patient would like to go to the hospital and the patient declined.  EMS left and the patient remained seated, resting for an additional 20 minutes.  The patient left the pharmacy.  The pharmacist spoke with the patient several hours later and the patient reported he was doing fine at home resting.  The pharmacist counseled the patient to contact his primary care provider regarding the incident.

I had sudden and intense tightness in the left chest (felt like I was shot) the developed into pain and then numbness/immobility of the left arm (vaccine was administered in the left shoulder area).  Since this point I have had routine soreness/tightness in the chest and constant shortness of breath/wheezing.

He felt slightly better and upon arriving home the patient had troubles breathing and explained it as a panic attack without actually having any anxiety. The patient consulted with a physician at a local clinic and was instructed to go to the emergency room. I have not had contact with the patient since arriving at the emergency room.

Shingles were accompanied by eye irritation, headaches (localized on left side), and light headness.  Treated with Prednisone and Valtrex.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

Patient does not speak English so his wife translated and shared that the patient wasn&#39;t feeling well due to allergies to the pollen and wasn&#39;t sure if he could take the shot. I checked the patient&#39;s temperature and it was 98.7F. I asked the patient what his symptoms were. Patient reported mucus draining causing irritation to the back of his throat. I recommended OTC nasal spray for the post-nasal drip. I asked if patient had any history of allergic reaction to any vaccine, fainting, or history of seizures and patient denied. I stated patient was in the clear to take the shot if he was comfortable. Patient said okay. Pharmacist administered the shot and patient and his wife were seating in our waiting area to wait 20 min. After 10 min, patient&#39;s wife screams that her husband is not feeling well. Pharmacist rushes to the patient and sees his body shaking in the seat and asks a customer to lay him on the ground. Customer calls 911. Seizing lasted less than a minute. I approach the scene and immediately lay the patient to his side. Patient is conscious and breathing. Patient denied chest paint, headache, or tingling sensation in hands and feet. Patient vitals were checked. Paramedics arrive and did a full check up and everything was within normal limits. Patient openly reported he had not eaten all day and has history of fainting after shot due to anxiety of needles. Paramedics encouraged patient to seek medical attention, but patient denied. Patient was given water and a banana and went home.

He was pale/yellow and eyes hard to keep open. Pulse was 75. BP 114/77. Patient indicated on var and when questioned prior to administration that he had no allergies and no problem with any shots in the past. Questioned him again and wife told me that he did have a history of passing out with blood draws. Applied ice packs on head and wrists and got patient flat on floor with feet elevated. Family requested that EMS be called.  Nurse standing in line assisted in monitoring patient until EMS arrived. Blood sugar was 108 and pulse 117/77 taken by EMS. Patient was able to stand for them and refused transport. He remained seated for 20 minutes longer after they left. He was able to stand without symptoms and said he felt fine.

                                                1h after the vaccination, I had the usual arm pain which lasted for a few days and then completely cleared away (next day I also had fever 37.5-38 C, fatigue, and muscle pain).  However, 8 days after the vaccination, on Friday 30th of April 2021, I woke up in pain: my arm was hurting again and this time I could not find a position on how to keep my arm and not feel pain. I eventually fell asleep but the arm pain at injection site persisted for days. Today (5th of May), five days after the second I still feel some discomfort in the shot area which sometimes goes above the pain threshold.   I did read about people having delayed arm pain, especially with the Moderna vaccine, which is a some kind of delayed antibody reaction. But I did not read about people having both just-after-shot pain and delayed pain and I do not know if I should take the second dose while my arm still hurts from the first does (I have my second shot in 2 weeks). Should I wait for no pain? Should I do it in the other arm? Could you please advise?  Probably nothing, but just to mention everything I know: one contributing factor could be that I went to the gym the previous day of receiving the vaccine and worked my shoulders - I was already a bit sore when I got the vaccine.

                                                I received my second vaccination Tuesday around 5:30pm. I had a lower back muscle spasm on Monday morning, but the muscles were feeling significantly better by the time of my vaccination. I again took two ibuprofen before bed Tuesday night to help with my lower back muscles relax. (After I took the medicine, I then read that you aren?t supposed to take ibuprofen after the vaccine - the pharmacy unfortunately had only told me not to take Motrin - regardless the only other medicine I took was one Tylenol Wednesday morning). Wednesday morning I woke up with extreme back pain. This was in fact the worst lower back pain I?ve ever experienced. That lasted for about four hours. After that, my back pain subsided and I felt fine from around lunchtime until about 3. At that point I started to feel muscle aches throughout my body but especially in my legs. Around 6pm I started to get severe chills for the next three hours, although I never registered a fever I was shivering  at times. By 9pm I started to feel quite warm. I went to bed at 10pm still feeling a bit warm but was able to fall asleep. At 1am (Thursday) I woke up suddenly and was wide awake for the next two hours.  I still felt a bit warm and my muscle aches were quite strong. At 3am I fell back asleep. I woke up at 9:30am in a pool of sweat. However, my muscle aches had subsided and temperature felt normal when I woke up, but I felt tired and had a headache. My tiredness went away by early afternoon on Thursday and my headache went away around 6pm on Thursday, after which I felt back to normal.

Very sick for 3 weeks. 2nd shot: woke up next day ended in ER with fever over 102. Continuous pain, nausea, anxiety, and migraines. PCP and doctors keep denying the shot caused the issues and urged me to get the 2nd dose.

                                                At the time of vaccination just had pain in arm, didn?t have any of the other adverse reactions. Was recently exposed to someone who tested (&#43;) for COVID and have since had a fever everyday for the past TWO WEEKS.  Originally there were no other symptoms now however extreme night sweating has ensued. Multiple covid tests came back negative but the fever remains. Fever is mostly manageable with ibuprofen but it just keeps coming back when the ibuprofen wears off. I?m hoping to hear back that this is a normal experience for people in my situation? Doctors haven?t been able to explain it, don?t qualify for any of the covid benefits since my tests keep coming back negative so I?m still working and managing? but this is starting to get worrisome of what?s going to break the cycle of fevers?

                                                at around noon the day following my shot, I started feeling soreness all over my body. I took aleve. I felt some chills and a slight headache. These lasted until Sunday. Monday I started feeling very tired, very week, and still sore in my arms and a little in my legs. I took aleeve. Tuesday I still felt lingering soreness but no headache. I started feeling anxiety towards the end of my workday. At around 4pm I started to feel my legs quivering as if I had just run several miles and my muscles were week. This gave me anxiety as I was still working and assisting clients. at around 4:15 I started feeling like I was going to break out in hives around my neck area, which does sometimes happen to me. I got home and around 7pm I took a Zyrtec, but by that point hives started forming on my neck and head. I felt my lip start to swell. I woke up at about 3am on Wednesday to find both of my lips swollen and I took a Benadryl and went back to bed. I woke up at about 7am and my eyes were both swollen almost completely shut and my lips were swollen. I could feel itchiness from incoming hives around my neck and shoulders. I took two Benadryl and rested all day. The swelling mostly went down by the end of the day and I continued to nurse the Benadryl. I saw my doctor on the 15th. He advised how to proceed and prepare  with the second dose and referred me to an allergist.

                                                Continuing peripheral neuropathy. On 4/21 I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm and within two minutes had a vasovagal reaction?tingling in my underarm, flush feeling face and stiffness and tingling in my upper lips.  That mostly subsided within 30 minutes as the dull arm pain set in.  Over the next 7 days my arm pain intensified some and moved up my shoulder and down my triceps and into my elbow. 4/28 I awoke with numbness and tingling in my pointer and middle finger of my shot (right) arm in addition to the arm pain and neck and shoulder muscle tightness. 5/8 Arm pain and finger numbness still present, I did some yard work that exacerbated the arm pain, and at this point it was the first day I recognized the pain as a specific intense nerve pain from my shoulder, down my triceps, across my forearm and into my pointer and middle fingers. From this point on the nerve pain and finger numbness/tingling persisted and included intermittent cold forearm/fingers. 5/11 Met with my primary physician who diagnosed me with cervical radiculopathy (C7). Prescribed physical therapy, prednisone and flexeril. 5/12 Had a massage w/aroma therapy, cryotherapy, and cupping. Provided some relaxation, but no change in nerve pain or symptoms. 5/14 First day of PT; neck and arms stretches, neck traction and nerve glides 5/17 Completed Medrol dose pack, steroids seemingly had no effect. Flexeril at night helped relax neck and shoulder muscles a bit. 5/20 (Today) Still have numbness and tingling in my pointer and middle fingers with specific nerve pain down my triceps, elbow, across forearm and into my two fingers that intensifies with activity and at night.  Intermittent cold sensation in right hand, underarm inflammation and tenderness, and general weakness of right hand and arm.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Bronchoscopy (left lung filled with blood). Concomitant products included COLECALCIFEROL (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) for an unknown indication.   On 31-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 28-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 03-May-2021, the patient experienced HAEMOPTYSIS (coughing blood) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness of chest) and NIGHT SWEATS (night sweats). On an unknown date, the patient experienced PULMONARY THROMBOSIS (blood clot in left lung, left lung filled with blood) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). an unknown date, the patient experienced HEADACHE (slight headache for 2 days). The patient was hospitalized on 03-May-2021 due to PULMONARY THROMBOSIS. The patient was treated with HEPARIN (intravenous) on 04-May-2021 for Clot blood, at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, HAEMOPTYSIS (coughing blood) and PULMONARY THROMBOSIS (blood clot in left lung, left lung filled with blood) had not resolved, CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness of chest) and NIGHT SWEATS (night sweats) outcome was unknown and HEADACHE (slight headache for 2 days) had resolved.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   They did some tests and found there was blood clot in his left lung and put him on blood thinner but he reported that the blood thinner made his bleeding more worse. The patient still in hospital and currently in ICU and the Doctors are unable to determine where the blood is coming from and unable to remove the clot. And he is still suffering with blood cough.

All labs, MRI and CT scan came back normal.  March 3 went to see neurologists and had blood work and MRI which was unremarkable.  March 5 MRI with and without contrast showed is a vein near auditory canal on left side, followed up EEG but unremarkable. Started on Claritin mid-March for a week, headaches and pressure go from constant to occasional and Zyrtec, Singulair (prescribed), and Flonase (prescribed), but no significant improvement next few weeks.  On 02 April 21, was diagnosed with autoimmune attack of cranial nerves likely because of vaccine and was prescribed Nortriptyline for 1 month for headaches. On 07 April 21, hearing test came back normal, and mid-April headaches and pressure completely stopped but tinnitus remains. Again, started taking prednisone but no improvement.  04 May 21, nortriptyline was stopped, was prescribed acetazolamide after suggesting delayed Bell&#39;s Palsy like reaction.  10 May 21, immunologist also suggested delayed Bell&#39;s Palsy like reaction that may or may not be vaccine caused. Tinnitus responded to acetazolamide.

                                                About 12 hours after the shot I began feeling ill with flu-like symptoms, which is what happened with the first Moderna shot a month earlier. A few hours later, my entire body was throbbing with pain, I was in a cold sweat, my head was aching(it felt like an intense withdrawal) and I was incredibly weak. I stayed totally bedridden for 20 hours, forcing myself to sip water whenever I could muster the strength to sit up. My entire body was red, as though I had a light sunburn. The pain in my body and head was so overwhelming for a short period I considered calling an ambulance, but ultimately rode it out. Most of the pain, redness, and weakness have subsided over a day later, and I am about ninety-five percent back to normal with a very mild head ache.

All other associated soreness after shot subsided within 24 to 30 hours. Muscle soreness in these muscle groups have persisted through today and continue to do so. Lifting or moving objects that use these muscles is difficult or painful, and causes fatigue rapidly. Soreness not present prior to second injection, and would have been noticeable.

                                                Around an hour or so after the shot, I had mild face numbness. I noticed this with the first dose as well, but in both cases, it went away. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the onset of a migraine as I get migraines from time to time and I did have headaches/migraines with both doses. Around 12 hours or so after getting the second shot, I had flu-like symptoms (headache, nausea, aches, mild fever). I couldn&#39;t focus and vomited water/stomach bile a couple of times. After around 12 hours of feeling flu-like, I started to feel better and could eat simple food again (Corn Chex, chicken broth). I also had soreness in the arm near the injection site. I can&#39;t remember if I had neck pain or not. After the 12 hours or so of the flu-like symptoms, I quickly recovered. I would have reported this via VAMS, but felt so bad during the first 24 hours after getting the second dose, that I was late to registering my second dose in the VAMS system and the system would not let me retroactively report my symptoms. This is why I am submitting this VAERS report in case that it is helpful.

                                                No side effects from first shot.  Second shot was different.  Got my second shot about 2PM and around 1-2 AM I was getting ready for bed.  At first I was just feeling tired but then I started shaking uncontrollably and muscles in my neck and back were spazzing out.  I lost all control of my body and fell over, convulsing for an unknown amount of time.  I apparently foamed and/or drooled all over myself.  I woke out of this effect around 3:30 AM.  This was Friday/Saturday.  Its Monday now.  I still cannot stand straight and cannot create complex thoughts in my mind.  I had a hard time perceiving colors for the first day and a half to two days after the seizure or stroke I suffered.  I still have a migraine that feels like an elephant is sitting inside my skull.  I still cannot perform complicated thoughts nor can I do complicated things with my hands because of a lack of motor skills.  I successfully pulled every muscle in my back and neck and cannot stand upright.  I&#39;m 35 and now need a cane.  Its already been 3 days and things really have not changed.  Won&#39;t catch me lining up for a booster shot.  NO THANK YOU.  I did not seek medical attention because lets face it the healthcare system is a joke I would have needed a ride to a hospital, increasing my odds of getting the virus, to have them hold me as long as they can to stab me and poke me and take samples, give me no results, and a humungo bill.  I will die before I go to a hospital ever again because the amounts of testing I required at the time would have covered back and neck and brain scans of various types and those tests are stupid expensive and 99% of the time I&#39;ve ever got one they said oh I&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong go see my friend who is a specialist blah blah blah and its the &#34;doctor-go-round&#34; where you blow all your money on morons that only care about lining their pockets.

On day 4 I was nauseous  all day up to day 9.  On day 5 I started feeling chest pain right below my ribs in the center of my chest. If I sat up it was very uncomfortable and if I layed down the pain seemed to lessen.  On day 4 it seemed to throw my stomach off and up to day 9 I seemed to me more constipated. On day 5-8 I felt extremely  lethargic and need to nap which is something that I never do

Two days later I thought I was getting bit  by mosquitos because I was experiencing hives, I even had to call the health department to take car of the mosquitos but that wasn&#39;t the case at all, because they were hives and not mosquito bites. I was also receiving heat flashes throughout the night and that is still going on until this day. I was prescribed Prednisone 20mg 3 times a day for four days by my PCP and I did not see any changes for the random hives that I was experiencing throughout the day. Another problem that I have been experiencing was being dizzy at random times as well. I was advised by my PCP to go to the dermatologist to receive an allergy test but haven&#39;t been able to get around too it.

                                                I am a board certified infectious diseases pharmacist and I have given lectures over hypersenstivites reactions. I noticed itching at the injection site a little more than 72 hours s/p injection with some minor itching. This progressed over the next 20 - 40 minutes to severe itching with large erythematous rash to the the left axillary region, then shoulder,  and chest. Then hives developed pretty aggressively to majority of body including neck, back, inner thighs, and bilateral legs. The next morning I woke up to severe myalgias feeling like I was hit by a truck with soreness this resolved after roughly 24 hrs. Pain worse in buttocks, quadriceps, and sharp left lower mandible pain.  On 01/02 around 7:30 pm took Hydrocorticone 100 mg PO x 1 and 50 mg of diphenhydramine q4h and the allergic reaction resolved over the next several hours.  Still having upper torso itching going on 3 days after allergic reaction and 6 days after injection. Continued diphenhydramine 25 mg twice daily keeps the itching tolerable.

Followed by back and neck muscle spasms causing pain at any slight movement. Telemedicine visit to doctor suggested the sore throat was something viral (not Covid), and that it should go away. Two PCR tests were negative for Covid. Muscle pain has not been addressed yet, as I cannot make an appointment until I have been symptom-free for 72 hours.

This pain dissipated 48 hours after injection. Pain returned 6 days after injection, on Monday the 8th. Pain was in the lower portion of the left arm and in the calf muscle of left leg. In my opinion, this cannot be explained by any other physical activities.

He recognized that the fullness was worse when he was laying down. By the next morning, the fullness became more of a dizziness, he felt unstable, nauseated, weakness, and intermittent tightness in his chest. His symptoms have been mostly stable until this morning (12MAR2021) he woke with a disturbing feeling of fullness in his nose and sinuses. Then suddenly had a significant flow of blood from his RIGHT nostril. As of this evening he still has congestion in his sinuses, and intermittent tightness in his chest.

                                                Initial side effects (24 hours) soreness in upper arm. Within 36 hours I started getting extreme light headed. Within 3 days I started having pins and needle sensation in my right arm, from my shoulder to my finger, mainly my pinky and ring finger. I progressed to my left arm and right leg.  I&#39;ve had back pain since then but not sure if it&#39;s related. The pins an needles I feel every now and then but not as bad. The light headedness has not gone away, I can&#39;t shake it.  I&#39;ve seen my Dr, he put me on an anxiety medication.  My blood work came out good. I started the anxiety meds and started seeing a Therapist , but I don&#39;t really see a difference, it&#39;s nice to see someone but not getting better. I&#39;m coming off the anxiety med because a side effect is light headedness and that&#39;s not helping me much.  I have not got the second dose and do not plan on getting it.

Entire body was weak and fatigued.  48 hours everything seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.  Roughly 80 hours later from the vaccination, suddenly body cramped up and had trouble speaking and pronouncing words. Fell to the ground and had hand spasms similar to bells palsy or cerebral palsy. Could not speak fluently or get up on my own. After 45 minutes to 1 hour, when paramedics were called and came they sat me up. Within a few minutes, like a switch, I could speak normally again and could walk on my own. Walked out to the ambulance and waited for 15 minutes or so, and everything seemed fine and back to &#39;normal&#39;. Declined to go to hospital, and since that episode things are still &#39;normal&#39;.

Attempting a foam roller to stretch my muscle and release some pin to no luck. I considered going to the ER because of the pain not subsiding.   Around 2:30 AM I started throwing up, which lasted off an on for about a hour.   I returned to bed around 3:30 AM with the muscle tightness still happening. Around 4:00 I began having chills and my muscle started to relax. By 5:00 AM I was sleeping. No ongoing effective expect fatigue, and my throat was sore from throwing up.

                                                Day 1: Common symptoms: Fatigue, chills, headache. Day 2-Day14: Began experience upper gastrointestinal symptoms.  Pain, Bloating, Feeling of extreme fullness, Nausea, constant gurgling of the stomach.  This lasted for approximately ~ 2 weeks.  These symptoms have not fully resolved but have improved 85-90%. Day 3-current: Twitching and muscle spasms began in the arm that I got the shot in.  Shoulder, bicep, and into the forearm were CONTINUOUSLY twitching all day long.  Sleep became difficult for a period of a few days due to this.   This muscle twitching then began to occur in all other parts of the body.  Eye lids, arms, legs, torso.  Everywhere.  The rate of the twitches at worst was approximately 30 twitches per minute bouncing around from one area of the body to another.  I am currently 3 weeks post vaccination and although I have seen significant improvement in the twitching, I am still currently experience this symptom.

The girlfriend found him on the floor on the 21st dead on the floor in his hotel room at 8:00 AM.  The girlfriend said she had spoken with him around 10:00 PM and that he said he was going to sleep on the floor in the bathroom as he was throwing up and the floor was cool.  She subsequently found out that he was throwing up blood, and autopsy report showed that his stomach was full of blood and further testing is being done to see what has caused the bleeding.

These symptoms continued until about 2:00pm 04/08/2021 when they rapidly subsided. I did occasionally take acetaminophen to help reduce the fever.   04/08/2021 not sure of this is related or coincidental, but I had irritation on the skin of my penis after having intercourse with my girlfriend. I did receive a yeast infection after my first dose, and I&#39;ve never had either of these issues before or since.

                                                minutes after receiving the vaccine, I began feeling very light headed, my breathing became heavy,  my hands and feet began to tingle, became ice cold and and then went numb. felt like I was about to lose consciousness. I had to lay down for about 5 minutes before I started feeling any sort of normal.  Just about everyday since the Shot I have had a a high pitched ringing that comes and goes and a sever migraine that does not change if I take any medication (Advil). the only way to feel better is to sleep. yesterday was the worst yet.  when I contacted my pharmacist that administered the vaccine they informed me that they did not report my initial side effects and only after I called today were they going to report them.

Patient states that he felt normal within 30 minutes.

                                                After patient received his shot, while sitting during the 15 min waiting period. The patient began getting lightheaded and hot, his color went out of him and his eyes began rolling back in his head.  His eyelids turned a purple color and he appeared to momentarily stop breathing.  Myself and another pharmacist got him on the ground and supported his head with a coat.  When he &#34;came to&#34; and was talking to us.  He described feeling better on the cold floor and his color began coming back.   I was speaking with him the entire time.  While we were out with his 9-1-1 was called and paramedics arrived 15 min later.  by the time paramedics had arrived the patient had gotten up and back into the chair himself, was lucid and had color back in his face.  Paramedics arrived and took over.  He was given the green light from them and remained in the pharmacy area for a total of about 30 minutes before heading home. The patient was admittedly nervous for the shot and had not eaten or had anything to drink the whole day to that point. I believe he passed out from a variety of factors not related to the actual ingredients in the vaccine but cannot confirm this.

I told them to wait another 30 minutes to see if the symptoms would  improve. After 10 minutes, I went to check on him and he said the tingling sensation was gone, but not he was experiencing headache/head pressure  and warm sensation. I told him to continue to wait, which he did and after 20 minutes he said he was feeling  a little better and he was going to head home and rest. I counseled him to continue monitor the symptoms and if they progressed or worsen or if he experienced any new symptoms to seek medical care at emergency room or his primary care doctor depending upon the severity of the symptoms.

                                                Received first Covid 19 vaccine and was told to walk around by person who administered injection since they did not have enough chairs.  Approximately five minutes after injection I was standing in an aisle when my vision became blurry and I felt a wave of heat come over my body.  I began to crouch down and passed out hitting my head causing a concussion.

It becomes very difficult to concentrate on everyday tasks when it begins to increase in  severity. It began almost 3 weeks after I received my first vaccination and is still affecting me today.

                                                Approximately 2 minutes after administration of the vaccine, patient stated he was feeling light-headed, tingling sensation in fingers and beginning to sweat. He was instructed to sit back down, stay for a total of 30 minutes and let the pharmacist know if his condition worsens (his mother was with him). I, asked a technician to provide him with a bottle of cold water. After 4 to 5 minutes, his mother notified me his condition had worsened and the patient looked pale and sweat was visible on his forehead. Another pharmacist stepped in to assist because I was with a different patient. This pharmacist, aligned 3 to 4 chairs so the patient could lie down. He stayed with him until he stated he felt better, which was approximately 5 minutes later. For the record, the patient did not mention a headache or symptoms of a migraine. Patient called pharmacy on 4/14/21 and stated he&#39;s been suffering from a headache/migraine since the day of administration. The pharmacist recommended to follow up with PCP.

                                                I believe I experienced multiple symptoms as a result of my vaccine. My experience matches exactly as described in the article.  ON 4/1/21 at approximately 4pm I awoke from a nap experiencing acute vertigo, nausea and headache. I also was experiencing fever and chills. I began treating with excedrine but did not have an effect. The vertigo was very acute, my eyes were skipping and I was unable to walk. Nause was so intense that any attempt to leave my bed resulted in vomiting. I was unable to eat and could barely drink for the first 24 hours. Friday 4/2 at approx 7pm I took a dose of Promethazine which began to help the nausea. Extreme headache/migraine lasted for 3 days. During this time I also experienced extreme neck pain, as well as pain near base of skull, behind my ears, and on my temples. Symptoms were steadily improving each day, so I did not seek medical care during this time. I feel I became fully recovered by 4/18. I just had my second vaccine dose on 4/21 and I am very nervous about experiencing a relapse of symptoms.

All of a sudden he got up and started sitting down on the floor asking to lay down. He felt dizzy, faint. He kept saying faint. He also was feeling hot. The patient drank water and was feeling better. He wasn&#39;t always answering right away. He laid there for less than 15 minutes and then was able to get up and sit on the chair for another 5-10 minutes before he left the store. He called his wife to let her know. The store manager was with the patient the whole time.

Patient also stated that his entire face was itching really badly. I had him sit in the chair closest to me and pointed my fan on him. I asked him if he had ever taken Benadryl liquid before, and he stated that he had. I told the patient I was going to give him 10ml  (25mg) of diphenhydramine liquid and he said that was ok. I also noticed that both of his arms had a splotchy rash from his hands up. I asked him if it was like that before I administered the vaccine, and he said no. He took the medicine and said he started feeling better within the next 10 minutes. He said he felt good enough to leave and go on to work. I told him he could stay as long as he needed to, and offered to give him more Benadryl, but he declined. He stated that he has Benadryl in his car because some of the cleaning chemicals at his work make him itch, so he keeps Benadryl in his car.

                                                First I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to light, I was also feeling light headed and dizzy on my walk back to the car. (about 30 minutes after injection). I had someone else drive because I felt like I could not drive in my condition. On the ride home, about 40 minutes after injection, I began to have an increased heart rate and had a hard time swallowing. It was also slightly difficult to breathe. I felt like my head was cloudy and I had a hard time concentrating. I felt like my brain was responding about a half a second slower to what I saw. Like if I wanted to turn my head, I would think try to turn my head and my body would react a second later. When I got home, about 1 hour after the injection, my girlfriend told me my hands were freezing cold. I was also having a hard time walking in straight because I was so dizzy. I was still having some minor trouble breathing and swallowing. It was difficult to drink water. After about 2 hours my breathing returned to normal. My mind was cloudy all day, I felt like I was drunk.  On the second day, I woke up with an intense headache. It lasted for 3 days. My arm started to hurt on the second day as well, no pain at all the first day. My head was still cloudy and I had difficulty trying to recall memories or answer questions. By the third day this was basically gone. I was extremely tired for three days total. My mind remain cloudy for about a week.

                                                After he got the vaccine he called his son and quickly said that he had a headache. Said his back hurted him very badly. Then said he was itching all over his body. Then he said he was itching on his head. Then his opposite side of his arm started hurting him badly. And then he started having black spots forming on his feet. All this is traumatizing his kid. I?m not happy that my son has to worry about his Dad. This sort of traumatizing children should be illegal.  My son never done anything to y?all yet he is getting phone calls traumatizing him about a stupid vaccine everyday.

                                                Patient received his vaccine around 9:30AM. Felt fine in 15 min. observation area. Returned to work and began feeling &#34;tingling and numbness in my legs, pressure in my head, ringing in my ears, my arms got heavy and it was hard to move, I had trouble using the phone so told coworker to get his boss&#34; He stated, &#34;I was slouching in my chair, sliding out of it, and my eyesight was blurry&#34;. Nurse was summoned and laid him flat w/feet elevated. He ate a &#34;few donuts and peanut butter crackers after his shot&#34;. He felt better when lying flat but as soon as he sat up, symptoms returned three times. BP-142/88 initially, then rose to 149/106, Pulse-92 10 min. later. On third attempt to sit up, BP 153/99. Patient says his BP has never been above 128/84 and that he just had his annual physical two weeks prior and it was good. EMTs were called since symptoms kept coming back. BP was 170/100s. Was transported to Hospital. He said they did a &#34;brain test&#34; having him touch his nose w/his finger, slid heels down shins, etc. but no other testing was done.&#34; He was discharged to home around 3PM and was told &#34;he had an anxiety attack&#34;. He said they never really asked him what happened. Later that evening at 9:30PM, symptoms returned and he had to lie down. He had &#34;pressure in his head, ringing in ears, and couldn&#39;t get up.&#34; Wife called EMTs. His vision was blurry. BP 150/110 upon exertion (movement) and 138/103 at rest, Pulse btw 105-110. He refused going back to hospital since they did nothing the 1st time. I spoke with him Monday morning and he had seen his Dr. She put him on a Beta blocker still his BP was still elevated. He still feels &#34;cotton headed, muddled, w/constant ringing in ears.&#34; Did not go to work on Monday. Felt frustrated that ER &#34;blew it off and said it was anxiety, which he said he was not feeling anxious until his symptoms began and would not go away&#34;.

                                                On Sat, May 8th around 4:30 PM, while sitting and watching TV, I felt a numbing shock to the left side of my body (particularly left cheek, my entire left arm, and legs) and got up to check myself in the mirror. I got chills and my teeth began chattering, but my arm in particular felt like it was on fire. I thought I was having a stroke so I managed to drive myself to the ER where I was admitted. When the doctors performed the initial tests on me, my skin felt dull on my left side but my arm felt a burning-numbness to it. The doctors performed two MRIs, a CT scan, an Echo Cardiogram, Blood Tests, Blood Pressure readings, and a Covid-19 test and found no problems in my brain or heart, no Covid infection, and a healthy cardiovascular system. I was released May 10th with the diagnosis of a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) of unknown cause. When I woke up today on 5/11, the burning-numbing sensation returned to my arm again (even as I type this) but this time I know it is not a stroke. I have had no medical history, exercise regularly, have a healthy diet (vegetarian/vegan for more than seven years), the only thing I&#39;ve done recently is had my first Moderna shot injected intramuscularly in my left arm, the same arm where this burning-numbness is taking place. I thought it is best proactive to report this event and if there is any correlation to the vaccine

                                                I got the shot around 3:15PM on Monday 4/26/21. Woke up Tuesday 4/27/21 with a minor headache and just felt out of sorts. Around noon that day I had a seizure at work and was rushed to the ER. While at the hospital waiting for a room to open up, I had another seizure. This one was much worse than the first. They had to intubate me and I spent 5 nights in the ICU. Another 3 on the Neurology floor for observation. The seizures caused Rhabdomyolysis which caused damage to my kidneys and significant muscle loss/damage. I wasn&#39;t able to walk at all for 3 days. After that I started to be able to get up out of bed and move around a little more each day.

                                                Dizziness, unbalance. Vertigo was there occasionally the first couple days for hours or minutes, continues endlessly for now. I had a case of vertigo 8 or 9 years ago but no issues ever again with the ear or hearing or balance. After the first shot I twice thought I had a blockage or something in the ear. Tried drops, wax remover whatever you can find, nothing helped. Eventually it subsided but never gave real vertigo or long lasting balance issue. After 2nd shot was immediately an issue. Constant sweating and 99.5 fever for the 11th, 12th and 13th. 3 days straight of just sweating. Vomiting on around or just after midnight on the 13th, into the morning of the 14th. End of the 14th leading to the 15th the Veritgo has a light migraine attached. The migraine is mostly in the right eye has any migraine I&#39;ve had is, comes with some light nasal pressure right at the eye socket. No issues with nasal drip or stuffy nose. Slight blurred vision which either creates the migraine or is from it. I also had migraines in the past but no more than 1 a year for the last 5 years, nothing I have medication or treatment for any longer.  This vertigo has a low grade migraine with small dot of blurred vision from one eye, my right eye. I dance with my daughter which is usually holding hands and spinning until her feet come off the ground. The first recognition that something is terribly wrong in my ear was that the moment I spin I can&#39;t rotate more than once rapidly without becoming incredibly unstably dizzy. That regardless of the vertigo, migraine or anything has been true since the 2nd shot when I spin I am at a total loss of balance.  There is constant dizziness, blurred vision, migraine

Technician  and I gently lowered pt to laying on the floor and raised legs onto a chair. Pt immediately became responsive. Had pt lay on floor for several minutes with icepack on forehead. He soon said he felt a lot better. Had him sit up and remain sitting on floor for a few minutes. He said he felt fine so had pt return to sitting in chair position. He said he felt fine after his waiting period and left with his companion.

Body aches build over the night. Wake up with mild/moderate pain in back, knees, arm. Groggy. Went to work on something with a friend at 10:00 AM (T&#43;24Hrs), but had to return home because....  T&#43;24hr: ....headache growing. Went home and found fever at 102°.  Slight chills, bit mainly just heat without sweating. Fever hit 103.2 at peak. Went through 10lbs ice to keep the fever in check. Headache from T24hr-T36HR feels like a spike through the top of frontal lobe to my left eye.  T&#43;32hr: Headache still intense. Only back pain now. Appetite slowly increasing.  T&#43;48hr (Saturday morning). Back pain persists, but mild. Headache gone. Have a relatively normal day.  T&#43;60hrs (Sat. Afternoon): Back pain increasing. Stop all unnecessary lifting/moving.  T&#43;68hrs (early Sunday morning): Go to ER with the back pain. Absolutely excruciating spasms from top of sacrum - roughly LI/12T. Lower back stiff as wood. Given shot or Toradol, dose/prescription to flexiril. I specifically request this plan because usually takes care of the spasms; basically, get me able to move and the pain/spasms will go away.   NOTE: I have a history of back issues in this area, but I have not had an episode in years and certainly never had an episode that works like this with no relief. From about 2017-2019, I r  T&#43;70-78hrs: Feel normal.  T &#43; 78-88hrs: lower back pain comes back with an absolute vengeance.  T&#43;90hrs (early Monday morning): Return to ER. Back pain worse than Sunday morning. Receive toradol shot and prescription Prednisone. Back pain gone by around 10:30 AM. Decide to take prednisone Tuesday morning as its getting a bit late in the day by the time pharmacy fills the prescription.   T&#43;90hrs: Back pain returns in similar fashion as Sunday afternoon. Still. Barely mobile.   T&#43;96 hours: Wake up with lower back pain similar to Sunday/Monday morning. Took prednisone and flexiril this morning.   Please help me.

                                                The day after the shot, I had the expected fever. The following day, I began to have hand pain and weakness. This continued and seemed likely to be a flare of Sjogren&#39;s, significantly more severe than any symptoms I had previously experienced. After a couple of weeks, my rheumatologist tried me on a pack of methylprednisolone which helped while I was taking them but symptoms rebounded as soon as I finished the pack. This seems like it is not directly related to the vaccine&#39;s action, but the timing makes me think it prompted my immune system to get carried away even after it finished the response to the vaccine. We are continuing to investigate treatment, but in the meantime, I am having to get help for things requiring gripping and I am limited in my ability to type and thus work, so I am also having to look at speech-to-text programs.

Patient can only use his eyes to respond &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34; since he is non-verbal and when he would not respond to his mother&#39;s questions with his eyes she became very panicked and alerted the pharmacy staff.  When I got to the patient he was very clammy, sweating, and breathing heavy.  She said his eyes had rolled back in his head and his tongue had turned blue.  I propped his legs up on a chair and took his blood pressure with an automatic blood pressure cuff and it was 164/124 with pulse 95.  I decided to contact EMS for assistance. Retook BP  few minutes later and it was the same.  EMS arrived and stated it was most likely a reaction to being afraid of needles but would take him to get checked out.

                                                Little to moderate numbness from injection site on my left arm, up the shoulder, up the left side of my face, and up to my left eye. No weakness in muscles or drooping face. Came and went. Physical activity such as lifting heavy objects and sleeping on my left side made the symptoms worse.  Numbness lasted for about 2 weeks then went away. I can&#39;t remember exactly when it started, but it was shortly after the first shot. I received the second shot on my right arm from a different pharmacist and didn&#39;t have numbness. The pharmacists believed that the first shot was given too high and may have hit a nerve. Could the vaccine be injected too close to a nerve which could result in aggravated nerves?

A several days passed and the twitching moved to other parts of my body.  Here it is June 9th and the twitching still continues. I saw a Neurologist, Dr. and he ran additional tests to check for any muscular issues - everything came back normal.

He developed difficulty walking due to joint pains. Received 2nd dose of vaccine on 5/28/21. Came to the ER on 6/4/21 due to persistent hand swelling. Labs sent on that day showed proteinuria for which he was sent to rheumatology (serology done for SLE came back positive) and nephrology. Patient has been diagnosed with systemic lupus eryhtematosus with renal involvement.

                                                In early May my 2nd Moderna vaccine shot caused a typical flu like symptom for 48 hours and then back to normal.   About a month has passed and on June 11th I have started to feel like I had a sore throat, then the next day and since then I have an intense pain around my thyroid area  when swallowing and it feels sore to the touch.  My doctors office has taken swabs for flu and bacteria which have come up negative, and I am waiting on a Covid test which I presume will also be negative.  Currently they diagnosed me with Pharyngitis, and I believe that it is subacute thyroiditis as a reaction from the vaccine. I have not been sick or come in contact with any sick people, and have worn a mask everywhere out of my home.

Pain is elicited on palpation (no induration felt today) and with certain movements (lifting of arm and abduction).  He relates this specifically to the vaccine administration site.  He said that he had only experienced soreness at the administration sites immediately following the vaccinations until now.  He also has had numbness involving what appears to be the medial nerve (just one time in last week) and strange sensation down at the elbow/AC area.  Advised to F/U with PCP from health system return to work coordinator if employee feels he needs medical treatment .  This was communicated to employee and it is unknown at this time if employee has sought medical care.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

This is not a report of the typical soreness after a shot.  Concern for tendonitis/shoulder injury from the shot itself or a complication thereafter.  I have been taking ibuprofen around the clock.  The normal soreness after the shot started around 12 hrs.  These subsequent pain/weakness issues continued on after that point

My wife helped me downstairs and after some water and Tylenol, symptoms reversed themselves in about 15 minutes.  My body temperature was not recognized by the thermometer and then registered 93.4

Then still chills and insomnia. Fever that persisted over the next 36 hours. Responded well to Ibuprofen 400mg for 4.5 hours until symptoms returned. Began alternating with Acetominophen 650mg for better effect. Fever was highest (recorded) at 102.2 F 29 hours after injection. Woke up 40 hours from vaccine after a night of sleep and with reduced fever. Still going up and down a bit off any medication. Last reading 46 hours from vaccine 100.6, but two hours earlier was 99.4. I?ve also had nausea, exhaustion, and tiredness. Also cold symptoms which may be related to the slight cold I had the morning of the vaccination that I didn?t think was anything to worry about - my kid is in daycare and I feel like this for a large part of the winter!

I was unable to speak for a few minutes due to the uncontrolled muscle contractions and was just generally too uncomfortable to move. It was not a seizure, but it was temporarily debilitating. Once I got myself wrapped in a warm blanket, it only took about 10 minutes to pass (and never returned). The rest of the day I did feel generally ill, but the day after I felt completely back to normal.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the moderna Covid vaccine I&#39;ve had a low grade fever and chills.  Three days after the shot, I experienced the worst headache of my life.  I received my shot 6 days ago and I still feel very &#34;hot&#34;/low grade fever and experiencing flushing of the face.  The symptoms haven&#39;t felt serious but I&#39;m hearing approximately 60% of individuals I speak with are experiencing the same or worse symptoms.  I worry that individuals won&#39;t want to receive their 2nd shot due to the reported side effects.  I believe more awareness should be communicated to the general public, so they aren&#39;t caught off guard.   I had a covid test conducted on Friday (negative) and will get another one this week to be certain I do not have covid.

The following day about 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I got a pain in my lower back. I have been doing stretching,  heat, massage and OTC pain relievers. The pain in my lower back is serve, I couldn&#39;t really stand up straight. I have had to miss a few days of work. I have talked to a family friend who is a Doctor and he said it should only last for a 1-2.

The day after I received the vaccine I was very tired feeling, my left arm very sore, and I noticed my heart rate was staying higher. At one point at work my heart rate went up to 140 bpm. I went to the doctor after work and was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia. I was prescribed metoprolol for tachycardia. I do not know what caused my heart rate to increase, but the metoprolol has my rate controlled now. I felt the fatigue lasted about 3-4 days and then I was back to normal.

We kept an eye on him for about 20 minutes, he wasnt wanting to eat his lunch.  His face was also flushed which can be an indicator that he doesn&#39;t have enough prednisone on board.  We gave him an additional dose of his morning prednisone dose, 7.5 mg.  The swelling subsided in about 30 minutes, he ate and said he felt much better.  We will double his evening dose and contact his endocrine doc for more instructions.

After the second dose, he also had a fever the first day, developed severe pain in the right arm with swelling and sensation of heat which did not respond to ibuprofen; radiation of pain down to his hand and into his upper chest, all of which persisted for several days, requiring a visit to the emergency department on 2/12/21, where a workup including CBC, chem, CK as well as an x-ray of his shoulder and venous doppler study were negative. His pain and swelling have persisted for over a month although they are starting to gradually improve.

                                                Approximately 9 days after initial shot, I developed  swelling (about 1 cm thick) between my elbow and shoulder near the injection site.  The site itself was extremely red/rashy. The area was around 5-6 inches by 4-5 inches.  It was itchy and hot to the touch compared to surrounding tissue. It was accompanied by slight pain in the arm. Symptoms receded by the 11th day.

I called 911 as soon as he began to lose consciousness and while I was on he phone with 911, he regained consciousness and had color in his face again and felt much better. EMS and the firefighters checked him out and all of his vitals were normal and he could walk upright just fine.

All of these symptoms subsided  within approximately 36 hrs. after time of vaccination with plenty of rest.

                                                Very sore arm, fatigue within hours of the vaccine. Then 6th day (morning) throat swelling and face when waking up and rushing to the emergency room where I was given a steroid and Pepcid to open my airways and was discharged by 9:30 AM ET on 03/10/2021 after throat opened back up and swelling decreased. I was given a script for EPI, Medrol Pack and Pepcid. Upon returning home I had began having hiccups at 8 PM that lasted through Saturday 03/12/2021, where I was admitted to the hospital for a lot of antihistamine rash reactions over my body that continued from the morning of 03/10/2021. Then went to the hospital again on 03/13/2021 and was given a muscle relaxer baclofen around 7 PM to rid the constant hiccups that were concurrent from what seemed to be the steroid used to open my airways. Went home and have had fatigue, but feel mostly better with appetite back. My family doctor saw me on 03/16/2021 and saw that I was still having a reaction on my back and arms with antihistamines and said it was the Moderna shot and I needed to consult with a pharmacist on what to do or the FDA/CDC as he didn&#39;t know enough on it. Now Pharmacy won&#39;t give me my second dose due to the CDC guidelines and they want me in a medical setting to have the second one, if I am allowed - something I am not privy to. I need help and guidance ASAP on what to do.

A shopper alerted our staff and when I came to check on him, he was just rousing but had his eyes closed due to blurred vision. He was able to speak and look directly at me. He said this reaction had never happened to him before. He seemed jittery probably due to the reaction. Asked for water and was able to drink. He said that he most likely hit his head and compressed his finger during the fall but feels okay. We are not sure how long he was out for.

                                                Patient noted he had no adverse reactions with his first dose of the Covid vaccine or other vaccines he has had in the past.  He was informed that  there are more chances of side effects experienced with the second dose ( such as headaches, flu like symptoms, nausea).  He was directed to stay in the store for at least 15 minutes and to inform the pharmacy immediately if he felt anything  out of the ordinary.  He said he walked down several aisles then started feeling light headed and having tunnel vision.  He was on his way back to the pharmacy when he ended up on the ground.  He does not remember how he ended up laying on the ground.  He said his head did not hurt but does not know if he hit it.  When started regaining conscience, his right arm and leg jerked somewhat then calmed down.  When he came to, he said he didn&#39;t feel dizzy when he tried to sit up.  The ambulance was called so he was instructed to remain laying on the floor.  The EMT personnel asked him his name, the date, and where he was while he was laying down and after sitting up on the floor.  He answered correctly both times.  He was then asked to sit down on a chair to take his blood pressure.  The EMT personnel were having trouble   getting a good reading so he was transported to Hospital.

                                                This morning I gave a patient a moderna vaccine. During administration the patient expressed his fear of needles. After the vaccine I asked the patient to have a seat and wait in the waiting area for 15 minutes. He went and sat down for just a couple minutes and stood up to look for his spouse and when he stood up he passed out and hit the floor face first. I ran out there to check on him and he was unresponsive and bleeding a lot. My team immediately called 911. I started tapping him and slightly shaking him and after a few minutes he woke up. He told me the only thing he remembers is feeling dizzy then woke up on the floor. EMS showed up a few minutes later and took the patient to the hospital.

                                                The side effects I&#39;m experiencing didn&#39;t start until about 2 days later.  It started out as pain at the injection site with extremely bad dizziness that has gotten worse each day. On day 4 after the injection I noticed a full pain in my left thumb area. The same side as the injection. I didn&#39;t think anything of it but as the hour&#39;s and days went by it continued and continues to get worse. The best way I could explain it is it feels like when your hand falls asleep without the pins and needles. Yesterday I ended up having to go to the ER. My issue with my left thumb area started to get much worse. I couldn&#39;t hold things in my left hand and started to radiate up my arm. It was the weirdest feeling I can&#39;t really explain it other than being slightly numb and very week. I wasn&#39;t able to move my hand much at all. They gave me a cat scan but they never called me back to be seen or to give me my results. I was there for 8 hours and was never called back to be seen. I had to leave this morning before I was seen because I didn&#39;t have anyone to watch son. Today is 8 days since I received my first covid shot and I still have major fatigue along with dizziness. I will start sweating profusely out of nowhere and then stops.  I&#39;ve had a numb/metallic taste in my mouth for about 4-5 days as well. I feel like I&#39;m in a complete fog and can&#39;t shake this feeling. I&#39;m having trouble concentrating and remembering things. I&#39;m drinking lots of water and trying to rest when I can but I&#39;m still feeling terrible with no signs of this getting better. My doctor suggested I report this to you and I&#39;m hoping and praying this goes away. Is there anything I can do or a specialist I could see? Thank you so much in advance.

However, the next day on 4/17/2021 I have pain in my right leg calf. The pain is to the right of the calf and feels like a dull pain. The area is not warm or swollen so I don&#39;t expect it to be a blood clot, but thought it might be worth reporting just in case.

                                                An hour after injection I tried eating some food and found that if I chewed and swallowed too quickly I began to have q tickle in my throat that led to coughing and vomiting, this symptom has begun to fade. I also started having pain in my right arm after a few hours, which I expected, but at roughly 2am the night of the injection, my right armpit also started feeling painful. It&#39;s now been 2 days and while most symptoms have abated, my right armpit is still incredibly sore.

                                                My left arm was sore about 2-3 hours after the shot. Later that evening, my arm was worse and I could not lift my arm up past my chest. Around about 11:00 p.m., I began to feel chills, aches and pains. I was sluggish, tired and had no energy. The next day when I woke-up around 10:00 a.m., I still had the aches and pains, all the way down to the bottoms of my feet. My body hurt to stand. The aches and pains continued that evening, along with diaherra and chest pains. The pains continued through Saturday and the chest pains got worse. The pain would radiate from my chest to my left arm, to my left shoulder, and into my back between my shoulder blades. Then by 7:00 p.m. or so on Saturday, my chest started to feel better and my aches and pains were not as bad. I was then woken up around 12:00 a.m. or so, on Saturday/Sunday with severe chest pains again with the radiation of pain. This also came along with the aches and pains and diahrrea. This has continued through to today, Monday. I tried to do simple putting my dishes away and loading up my dishwasher, and couldn&#39;t complete the task due to the chest pain and severe aches and pains all over my body. I have tried to treat the symptoms with over-the-counter medications which would include: Advil II, Pepto Bismal, Alka-Seltzer, hot showers, hot baths, luke warm baths, vapor bath soaks and a heating pad.

Patient was slumped over in his seat, extremely labored breathing and his eyes were rolling to the back of his head.  The Pharmacist spoke to the patient to see how he was feeling but he wasn&#39;t very responsive so we administered an Epipen and immediaetly called 911.  The paramedics came at around 6:20pm and checked the patients vitals. EMT said the patients vitals were normal and have the patient the option to go to the ER.  Patient was alert and able to drink water.   Patient refused hospitalization.  We advised the patient to go directly to the emergency room if he was developing any symptoms once home and to follow up with his primary care provider.

Like an intense ice cream headache that lasted for nearly 4 hrs and continued to come back later in the night in different strengths. I?ve been through a lot of physical pain in my life- this is the second worst pain I ever remember feeling. It was unbelievably intense and way beyond any migraine I?ve ever had. I thought that I was having a stroke or an aneurism it was unlike anything I?ve ever felt before. Afraid to get my second dose!

This was approximately 5 minutes after the patient had received his vaccine.  The patient had his eyes closed and reported feeling hot and tingly.  Patient exhibited no signs of rash or respiratory reaction. Patient was given a cold pack for his neck and recovered after a few minutes.  During a follow-up call the next day, the patient reported he had fainted at some point when his eyes were closed.  After leaving the pharmacy, the patient went home and took a nap.  The patient reported no further or lasting effects.

                                                Approximately 3- 5 minutes after felt strange mild sensation as if pins and needles was moving throughout my body from the injection site. I also started to breathe differently. Couldn&#39;t tell if my heart rate changed or not.   At about 5 minutes, I started to feel light-headed and nauseous as if I just had blood taken or an IV in my, likely a drop in blood pressure. I was reading a book, put it down on my lap as I couldn&#39;t focus on reading and considering to get help. At that moment, I passed out, hunched over in my chair staring at the floor.   This moment likely lasted for about 1 minute, but felt like 20. I was in a dream like state and at one point had a series of images and/or memories flash by in a sequence. Then, I felt like I was half asleep but couldn&#39;t tell what I was staring at but knew that I had to &#34;wake up&#34;.   Then , I was surrounded by people who helped me up. At this moment I felt very weak and tired and was sweating profusely. My right hand felt very weak.   About 10 minutes later, I started feeling better. I was given water which seemed to help. I would have waves of mild nausea come and go that eventually subsided. I also felt random cramping around my stomach/lower chest area and lower right side rib cage area.   At about 15 -20 minutes felt confident to walk to the bathroom and throughout the store. Eventually, I felt confident to drive safely home.  At the time of writing this (approx 2 hours later), I&#39;m feeling random sensations/feelings of itchyness throughout my body. No sign of hives.

                                                Minor back pain began on the 21st. Significant discomfort and limitation of mobility by evening of the 22nd. Increasing discomfort throughout the 23rd, such that I could not twist my torso or reach across my body without acute pain. Currently, severe cramping/spasms of muscle groups left of the spine even without attempted motion. It feels as if someone is punching my left lung from the back. There is, however, no numbness or weakness anywhere, no radiating pain, no lung problems or any other issue. Just constant muscle cramps/spasms. May end up visiting a hospital.

By 8pm I was shivering uncontrollably and had broke out in a cold sweat, the aches increased. This condition lasted through the night.  On 4/30 I awoke around 5:30am, the shivering and sweating had stopped but the aches persisted through the entire day. I took one Ibuprofin around 8 am and experienced mild relief from the aches, I took another Ibuprofin around 5pm. At about 8pm I once again broke out in cold sweat and the aching intensified, I did not experience shivering the second night. Once again this state lasted through the night. On 5/1 I awoke with mild aches which still persist today 5/2.

As a result I?m unable to speak or eat. Recommended treatment has been Tylenol, and antihistamine. I?ve been taking probably more than recommended of both, and as of today, all symptoms persist.

                                                On first injection, after about 7 hours I started feeling extremely lethargic, next day was 103 degree fever which lasted around 5 days with chronic diarrhea, and then a futher 7 days with 100&#43; degree fever that was not reduced further by OTC treatments. Weakness continued for 10 days, followed by insomnia (2 hours of sleep or less per night) with the ability to fall asleep, but no ability to stay asleep. And lack of appitite, eating around 50% less food than was before the vaccine. 3 weeks after initial injection, PCP recommended Trazodone, which improved the sleep function to about 4-6 hours per night, but not the usual 8, has not improved food intake very much.  6 weeks later, ability to eat and sleep normally has not returned. No other symptoms other than lethargia from caloric deficit.

                                                Approximately five minutes after shot, my face began to tingle. My heart felt like it was racing. I had difficulty focusing with my eyes, it felt like my eyes were rolling.  My feet began to tingle. My spouse honked the car horn for assistance. I reached for my epi pen but did not administer it because a doctor was approaching our car. I checked my pulse rate on my iWatch, it was 168.  My throat began to feel tight. The doctor listened to my lungs and heard wheezing. A paramedic came over as well. My blood pressure was taken but I do not remember what my blood pressure was.  At that point the doctor said I should use my epi pen. The paramedic said I should use Benadryl. They were in disagreement, and the paramedic said I should take 50mg of Benadryl and had me put my car seat in recline position.  It was at the point they noticed that my face and chest were flushed.  They had me drink water.  We waited about 45 minutes. My lungs were checked again by the paramedic and I was told my lungs were clear, my blood pressure was taken second time but I do not remember my blood pressure, my face was less flush,  my pulse was in the 70?s.  I still felt tingling on my scalp and feet, my throat felt like it had a lump in it.  I Began to feel nauseous.  I was given the okay to leave and go home.  I had nausea until the evening the next day.  I did not eat until dinner time the night after my shot.  I only drank water.  The next day I experienced shortness of breath performing  duties that typically do not make me out of breath.  I had to take many breaks and used my abuterol inhaler two times.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   Fever fluctuating between 101 and 102 degrees F. These symptoms lasted for approx. 8 hours, between 11:00 PM and 7 AM:  extreme weakness (unable to get out of bed; difficulty rolling over); extreme cold and shivering; profuse sweating; delusions between dreams; inability to sleep; severe muscle pain (every movement hurt, like a wore brush being run across whatever muscle moved).  Anxiety and panic attacks because I did not know that the side-effects could be so severe until talking to others who had similar experiences today. Those who I&#39;ve talked to prior to today had some reactions, but such bad ones. The side effects on the fact sheet are not described in terms that made me think these would be mild. However, mine last night were worse than any other illness I&#39;ve had in my life. Not having the strength to move and at the same time feeling as though I was freezing to death with lying in a puddle of sweat brought on a lot of fear--I felt sure I would not make it through the night, and could not even reach the phone to call anyone, which made it more terrifying.  After 7 AM today, falling asleep during work; sweating and chills; muscles ache and pain; exhaustion after performing simple tasks (making tea, eating cereal, etc.); fever between 100 and 102 degrees, fluctuating throughout day.

I had 103.5F fever, nausea, body ache, and site pain. On 5/10/2021, the adverse events started. The injection site started itching, my face started itching, tingling and swelling in my face and lips. 5/12/2021, the injection site still itches, face and lips are still swollen. Took Benadryl gel capsules. I noticed as the swelling in my arm goes down, the other symptoms are going away.

                                                Fatigue and arm pain same day following shot (Monday 1:15pm). Next morning (Tuesday) fatigue rapidly progressed to fever and chills. Chills became increasingly intense around 10am-noon, had to bundle up and lay down, could not move, work, or do anything productive. Chills, fever, headache, muscle aches became so bad they were totally incapacitating from about noon to 3PM, probably would have made my spouse drive me to the ER if I wasn&#39;t expecting some sort of vaccine reaction like this. However, just as suddenly as these intense flu-like symptoms came on, they began to recede. Fever broke around 3PM, began to feel better, and by about 7PM I was feeling mostly normal, just tired &#43; a headache. Next three days (Weds, Thurs, and Fri) felt a little fatigue and difficulty concentrating, nothing too terrible. But the flu symptoms the day after the injection were intense! and weirdly short-lived.

He stated that his arm felt really sore, and he had tingling/numbness in his hand on the same side that he received his vaccine. No outward signs of Anaphylaxis, had patient remain under observation for approximately 20 more minutes after which time patient stated that his arm felt slightly better but still had that &#34;tingling&#34; feeling. He said it wasn&#39;t worsening or spreading. I counseled patient to seek additional medical care with primary care physician within the next 3 days even if the sensation goes away, and strongly recommended going to an ER immediately if he experiences any increase/ worsening of symptoms.  I also asked patient to follow up with as and informed him that I would submit a VAERs report.

                                                Loss of consciousness; Dizziness; Hyperhidrosis; Hypoaesthesia; Pallor; This case was received FDA VAERS (Reference number: 1086426) on 18-May-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 18-May-2021.    This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness) in a 37-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Eczema. Concurrent medical conditions included Skin infection (Infection on mid to lower back, possible eczema per patient). Concomitant products included TRIAMCINOLONE for Eczema, CEPHALEXIN [CEFALEXIN] for Skin infection.    On 09-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Mar-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis), HYPOAESTHESIA (Hypoaesthesia) and PALLOR (Pallor). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis), HYPOAESTHESIA (Hypoaesthesia) and PALLOR (Pallor) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 09-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 99 (normal) 99.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The reporter states that the patient received shot and then blacked out a minute or two later. The reporter called 911, and while on the phone the patient regained consciousness and felt much better.  EMS checked him out and all of his vitals were normal and he could walk upright just fine.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, although the events may be associated with the act of being injected rather than with the vaccine itself.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, although the events may be associated with the act of being injected rather than with the vaccine itself

At 1537, client asked EMT is it normal to feel a little warm and for my lips to tingle?? PHN overheard and escorted client to the zero gravity chair while EMT obtained the E kit and vital sign equipment. Upon further assessment, the client stated, ?about 5 minutes before my 30 minutes were up, my lips started to feel weird and slowly increased then plateaued. I feel flush and like my heart rate is elevated.? Client was not experiencing any shortness of breath, or tightness in his throat. PHN had client remove his mask to assess his lips. Client?s lips were slightly swollen with few darker pigmentations in areas. PHN also had client look at his lips, to assess if this was his baseline, and client stated, ?my lips have more color than normal.? Client?s skin was slightly red on his face. Client was alert and oriented times 4. Benadryl was offered to client by PHN and client refused. Client stated, ?I want to see if it goes back to normal on its own, and I don?t want to be drowsy.? Vital signs were taken at 1541 (heart rate 80, oxygen 96%, blood pressure 124/84). Vital signs taken at 1551 (heart rate 76, oxygen 96%, heart rate 130/86). At 1553, client stated, ?the tingliness is decreasing.? At 1557, client stated, ?I don?t feel flush anymore. I almost feel 100% normal, like 10% tingly compared to earlier.? At 1557, PHN assessed client?s lips and they appeared to be less swollen with pigmentation that was appropriate to race. Vital signs taken at 1600 (heart rate 78, oxygen 97%, blood pressure 126/96). Vital signs taken at 1606 (heart rate 81, oxygen 96%, blood pressure 128/84). Client is allergic to avocados and said that his throat swells up when he eats them, and he is also allergic to dairy. Client does not have any medical conditions and is not taking and medications. PHN provided client with education on life threatening symptoms and when to seek emergency services. PHN also advised client to follow up with primary care provider and to consult with an allergist before receiving another COVID vaccine in the future. At 1607, client stated, ?I feel good,? and left the facility unassisted with a steady gait.

                                                Patient arrived for 2nd Moderna vaccine today 5/30/21. He explained that he sometimes becomes faint or passes out after having blood drawn. Inquired as to whether patient had eaten this morning and he stated that he had. Advised patient we would have him stay in the pharmacy area longer just to ensure that he didn&#39;t have any ill effects from the vaccine before returning home. Within a few seconds of receiving the vaccine, patient stated that he was &#34;starting to feel it&#34;. At that point, rather than have him move to the recovery area, I decided to keep him in the IMZ booth and told him &#34;I&#39;m going to just keep you in here and we will talk for a while&#34;. Upon asking patient what his plans for the day were, he became mildly disoriented and I held his shoulders to ensure that he didn&#39;t fall from the chair. He temporarily lost consciousness (10-15 seconds) while still seated in the chair. Upon regaining consciousness, he was alert and responsive and did not show any ill effects aside from feeling warm. I had patient sit on the floor and placed ice packs on back of his neck and gave him another to place on his forehead and chest. Patient sat and spoke with me for appx 25 more minutes before leaving the area with his wife.

                                                Patient reported pain in left arm after receiving Covid Vaccine. Injection was given in upper left, outer area (backside) of patient&#39;s shoulder. Patient also complained of numbness in hand. Patient was able to move his arm above his head and open and close his hand. He stated that the numbness was resolving after a short time and that he no longer felt pain in his lower left arm but only in his upper left arm. He continued to move his arm freely even though it was painful for him as well. After consultation,  I advised him to seek urgent care from DH if his symptoms were to worsen or not resolve or if he felt he needed to be seen by a MD.

On day 4 of taking this medication, my right leg completely resolved of the swelling and heaviness and the &#34;bruise&#34; completely resolved without any discoloration.  This makes me think the &#34;bruise&#34; was engorged capillary vessels that were not flowing due to the clot.

                                                I received my first dose of the COVID 19 vaccine on the 2nd of May. Approximately a week or two later I started developing 2 unique symptoms not experienced before. First, I started getting a burning sensation across my left chest that would come and go. Second,  I started to develop pain every time I bent my thumb or pressed in the area of the metacarpal joint on my right hand. This persisted, and the week of May the 26th the burning sensation in my chest was getting stronger and the event lasting longer. It has now been a few weeks, and the symptoms were getting worse. It was enough concern to call my sister who is a nurse whom recommended I go to an urgent care. On the 26th of May I went to an urgent care. They stated that I should go to the hospital as they do not have the equipment to properly diagnose. I went to Hospital ER at approximately 4PM. It was there that I did blood work, got an EKG upon arriving and upon leaving, and x-rays of the heart. The outcome was that the physical exam, blood work, x-rays, and EKG did not show anything of major concern. The ER doctor thinks it is somehow related to the heart muscle surrounding the heart. I received baby aspirin, menthol patch, and was told to take ibuprofen as needed. For my thumb issue, I visited my chiropractor on 16 June 2021 and asked about the joint issues in the thumb, and he recommended to see my family doctor. He thinks it might be arthritis related. I am working to schedule an appointment.

                                                I received the Vaccine on Wednesday 1/6/2021 . Later that evening, my right deltoid was slightly swollen and painful. I would rate the pain 5/10. The next day Thursday 1/7/21, I noticed intermittent heart flutter/palpitations. I had my routine morning coffee and I thought the combination of the vaccine and the coffee might be the caused.  The flutter/palpitations continue to the present. I don&#39;t have shortness of breath. The left deltoid pain and swelling subsided. The flutter is intermittent and last 10 to 15 seconds.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

The right side of my bottom lip started tingling about 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I had no swelling or other impairment at the time and was released after 40 minutes of observation. A little later the entire right side of my face felt as if it had fallen asleep, approximately 1 hour later and it worsened until about 4 hours later. By the next day the nausea and lightheadedness was gone, and the tingling/numbness to the right side of my face was gone within 48 hours, improving after 24 hours.

                                                Nausea, lightheadedness, and finally numbness to right side of face, slight drooping on right corner of mouth and right side of bottom lip. It began with a tingling feeling in lip. Observing staff did not notice any swelling, or other impairments, asked me if I had anxiety, and sent me on my way. Shortly after, it felt as if I had gotten a shot at the dentist, and had the tingling numbness left over on the right side of my face. About 4 hours later, my bottom lip and right side of my mouth drooped slightly, but I could still smile, talk, raise my arm, so there was no other impairment. By the next day the numbness had mostly subsided, and the nausea and lightheadedness was gone. This vaccine was given to me at a work clinic in the administration building. I do not have contact information for them but was provided a packet with this website. I don&#39;t have any pre-existing conditions, do not have anxiety, am not a hypochondriac, did not even know about the Bell&#39;s Palsy issues in trials until after I felt numbness, and the right side of my face felt as if it fell asleep, like a foot falling asleep but it was my face. It was not to the extent of Bell&#39;s palsy, and may have even been my bottom lip swelling slightly on the right side that caused the droop. It infuriates me that this side effect was dismissed as me having anxiety because I was nervous that my face was going numb which would be a natural reaction for anyone.

Patient&#39;s wife had been rushed to the ER previously, and they discovered she was Covid positive when she was admitted. Patient immediately notified public health and was being restricted and followed up with. During his quarantine, he started developing symptoms (08Jan2021). On 10 Jan, he was rushed to the ER and diagnosed with pneumonia due to Covid. He was also experiencing painful stomach cramps, low oxygen saturations and fluctuations in blood pressure. He spent 3 days inpatient in the Covid wing then was discharged to resume resting at home. Our provider immediately reached out to the member and checked in with them. At this time, the patient&#39;s only real complaint is lack of energy or getting winded when doing projects around the house. Patient will isolate at home and monitor his symptoms. Public health and the provider will follow up with the member and her family periodically to ensure recovery.

The next morning, the hive had reduced, but a new one was seen on the right side of the base of my neck.  Very red and irritated looking but no pain or itching.   There were also 2 or 3 smaller hives a few inches below and to the right of my navel.  This was the only area in which I experienced itchiness.  I have pictures of the last two areas where this occurred.  Hives reduced each day until done.  The last to clear up was the one on my neck.  Total duration, approximately 3 or 4 days.   The areas seemed to line up with parts of the lymphatic system, when I looked up a map of it.

I began to feel ill. Arm hurt, headache, weight on chest. Body hurt. I went to bed early. I woke up on 13 JAN and felt worse. I stayed in bed until around 1300. I got up and went and sat in my office to work. At around 1700, I went to go get my children from a neighbors yard to bring them for supper. I made it to my back yard before feeling to tired to continue. I went inside and laid down. At around 1900 or 1930, I was putting my kids to bed. I then fainted once more. I don&#39;t know how long I was out each time. I don&#39;t think I hit anything with my head. I got up and went to my bed and texted a Doc.

At 3:00 that same afternoon, I began running a fever, which ranged anywhere from  99.8 - 102.6 over the next few days. I experienced body aches, fatigue, chills, nausea and vomiting (one episode), and headaches. I did receive a COVID (Rapid and PCR) and Flu test on the following Monday, all of which came back negative. On the 21 and 22 I woke up without a fever, but within approximately 3 hours of waking up my fever would return. Fever was treated with a rotation of acetaminophen and ibuprofen with success, however, it never dropped the fever below 99.0.

                                                Lower Back Spasms just a few hours after vacine was administered.  I went to bed with what I thought was just flu like syptoms like achy muscles.  But this was more then that.  Even laying in bed my back would spasm and almost take my breath away.  That night did not sleep due to the sporadic unpredictable pain when laying in bed.  Describe pain as electic shock or stabbing pain that takes your breath away it&#39;s so intense, but then goes away very quickly.  The next couple of days I was forced to stay immobile due to the pain that was sporadic in nature.  Even when laying down it spasmed.   I could barely walk for a few days.  I started taking NSAIDS to help with the pain and I became more mobile after a few days.  Work has been very difficult and spasms have not gone away even now Im still having problems and am struggling making it through the work day.  I have to lay down flat on my back as soon as I get home from work and take ibuprofen to relieve the pain.  I was absolutely fine healthy and very active person prior to the vaccine.  Just hours after getting vaccine it&#39;s almost like my joints and back were inflamed for some reason.

At around 08:00 pm I started to get really cold and had the worst case of the chills I have ever had. I was shaking so hard my body hurt. At around 10:30 pm I went to bend and started to get a low fever of about 101.4* and could not get warm. I started to get a bad headache and my body hurt. It was so bad I had to call in sick the next day for work. On 01/28/2021 I stayed home and had sever body aches, bad headache, the chills and I felt nauseas. From my left hip to my left knee it felt like I had a bad charley horse. That night I got another low grade fever of about 100.1*. I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and still had a headache. I took some Aleve and went back to sleep. I called in sick again the next day and that day I was a little better only had a headache, a little nauseas and body was only a little sore. I went to bed and am fine today. A note I have never tested positive to COVID-19 and I test weekly.

                                                About an hour post injection my arm became sore (remained sore for 4 days). The following day about 20 hours post injection I felt chills and tiredness. About 25 hours post injection I felt extreme fatigue and my whole body ached (this lasted for about 1 day). On day 3 post injection, I had a headache with nausea and motion sickness. Day 4 and beyond I have felt fine, no more symptoms of any sort. Chills were not treated. Body aches and headache were treated with ibuprofen and sleep.

                                                About 12 hours after the 2nd dose was given, I woke up at 2:30am with a severe headache, uncontrollable chills, muscular discomfort, soreness at the injection site, and fatigue.  I took 2 Tylenol, the chills subsided about 15 minutes after they began, and the headache was better about 30 minutes after taking the Tylenol.  I was in and out of sleep on the couch until around 6am, and I took my temperature at that time.  It was 102 degrees.  I took a couple more Tylenol at 7am and contained to take 2 every 4 hours (last dose around 6pm that night).  My temperature reduced gradually, but it was still over 101 degrees around noon.  By 6-7pm my fever was gone and didn&#39;t return.  I called out of work sick, and I fell back asleep in bed from 8am-11:30am.  I woke up with significant muscle pain in my left theigh (I sleep on my left side, but the pain was much more pronounced than usual).  This lasted 3-4 hours.  Overall, less acute muscle soreness lasted the full length of pronounced reactivity (~2:30am to ~6:30pm on 02/09).  Fatigue was evident until a went to bed around 11:30pm and not noted when I woke up at 6:30am on 02/10 for work.  Soreness at the injection site (left arm) gradually decreased over about 3 days following the injection, but it never impaired my ability to engage in everyday tasks.

As he was walking to the chair he stated that he felt faint, hot, sweaty, weak and shaking.  Upon arriving to the patient, the patient was hot to touch and had beads of sweat to forehead.  Patient was sitting crossed legged on the floor with head down.  Asked patient if he wanted 911 called and patient adamantly declined.  Patient was alert and oriented.  Pharmacy gave patient  a water bottle.  Had patient lie back with feet up.  After a few minutes patient started to feel better.  Had patient stand  up and sat patient in the chair in waiting room.  After going into the exam room for a few minutes to get ready for next patient, I went back into waiting room and patient was sitting on the floor again with legs crossed and head down.  Had patient come back to exam room and lie down on exam table with feet up.  After approx. 10 more minutes, patient was standing up in hallway and stated that he was feeling better and would walk around the store.  Patient left the store without checking back in.  Called patient to follow up at end of shift and patient did not answer.  Left a message letting the patient know we were checking on him.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after my second Moderna vaccine, I experienced the typical body aches, chills, headache, and tiredness expected in someone my age (38).  I was initially happy that my immune system seemed to have a positive response to the second dose.  About 24 hours after my second dose, I developed a severe headache and nerve pain all over the right side of my head.  No over the counter medicine would relieve the pain.  The next day, I developed a rash on my forehead.  The rash quickly spread and consumed the right side of my face and my right eye.  I was seen by medical staff, and received a diagnosis of severe shingles.  I was given Valtrex and, eventually, gabapentin.  My eye continued to get worse and I lost clear vision in my right eye.  I saw an ophthalmologist and was told that the shingles had activated in the eye.  My eye pressure was dangerously high.  I was given steroid drops and drops to relieve eye pressure.     Since February 22, I have battled shingles.  My rash is gone and my eye has cleared.  But, I still suffer from intense nerve pain in my head, forehead, and eye.  All medical professionals opined that the moderna vaccine must have played a role given the timing.  If shingles can be considered a side effect, it is one that has been intense and long-lasting.

Thats when the other nurse ran to the car to check on him and told me he was having a seizure. I ran to the lead to explain what happend and to call the medical team right away. The other nure was stablizing the patient. The patient was going in and out of consciousness for about ten seconds. The medical team arrived and took vitals.

                                                On March 24, 2021, the day of the shot, I only felt soreness in my left arm. The next morning, March 25, 2021, I began to feel body aches, chills, and I was in a cold sweat. I took ibuprofen throughout the day to combat the symptoms. The evening of March 25, 2021, the pain was much more severe (body aches all over my body, including my face, teeth, my hands were sore and stiff, etc.). I did not sleep much of the night because the symptoms were very uncomfortable due to the chills and cold sweats. The morning of March 26, 2021, my left armpit began to swell. By the afternoon, my left armpit (the arm where I received the vaccine) was swollen, tender, and soft. There is some redness and the swelling and tenderness are more pervasive. It is difficult to hang my arm at my side due to the pain and swelling. I understand, after calling the nurse hotline, that this is a common side effect but I also have a skin condition (Hidradenitis Supparativa) and it is difficult to know whether flare-ups are triggered by environmental factors.

He also stated that his bottom lip and chin started to tingle about fifteen minutes after the shot and then went away.  . I recommended that he immediately take a Benadryl tablet and wait a couple of hours I said he can take Benadryl every six hours if he needs to. If his symptoms don&#39;t go away  after two doses of Benadryl  I recommended he go to the Emergency Room and be checked out. Pre -immunization I counselled him  on the normal  run of the mill possible side effects and how to treat them.

Was on a road trip in a snow storm don?t know if it just was a combination of the nausea and the dizziness of the snow flying towards the windshield. But started to feel like throwing up. Pulled over and passed out, my wife says I was shaking. Came back to and throw up a few times.  After that I was just not feeling well and had nausea. Started feeling better later that day.

                                                I had a heart attack or major cardiac stress event after receiving the vaccine . This is concerning because when they did all of their imaging and test my heart is in perfect condition and there are no blockages and there was no reason for this to happen. After the vaccine I was fighting massive fatigue and muscle cramps. In the hospital ran my labs and found out that my potassium had bottomed out to critical level and is very likely the cause of this. But why did the vaccine cause my potassium to bottom out?? I eat healthy and take potassium supplements. I?ve been weight training and competing in bodybuilding and powerlifting competitions for about a decade. So having a healthy diet and understanding nutrition is something that I understand a lot more than the average person.

                                                At 0100, approximately 12hrs after receiving round two of the series, I started shivering uncontrollably. I would characterize this more as spasms than chills. I experienced steady dull muscle ache with occasional sharp jolts of pain, especially in my extremities. My joints began to ache severely and I was unable to sleep.  I registered a fever of 100.3 (my normal temperature is ~97.5). Additionally, I experienced nausea and a moderate headache. I shivered most of the evening and finally got out of bed at 0700. I immediately noticed that I was lethargic and fatigued. My doctor recommended I take 1000mg Tylenol to address the symptoms. This was effective, but only for two hours. After that my symptoms returned - most notably the fever and uncontrollable shivering. Symptoms appear to be declining at this point, approximately 31 hours after injection.

I was out for 30-40 seconds then startled awake. I laid in the floor for about 10 minutes and my wife helped me get back to bed.

Ever since then my arm has been a numb feeling. After the second vaccine both sides of my cheeks get this numb tingling feeling. Like muscle weakness. Both arms now feel week and a numbing twisting feeling. I?ve never had this feeling before and feeling like I can?t grip. The feeling is like the arm was slept on. Or fingers being pulled backwards. The facial problem is quite concerning and happens anytime during the day.

                                                Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA). The person administering the vaccine on behalf of CIC Health, whose name I later learned, injected the vaccine too high (roughly level with the acromion process) and far back. Initially there was only a quick burning sensation. The pain started about an hour later, but at that point it was mild and only notable because of the quick onset and slightly different feel from the first dose. Over the next few hours, it intensified and I began to lose the majority of the range of motion in that arm due to excruciating pain. I saw my primary care physician the next morning, he confirmed the positioning of the injection was incorrect.

Within a few minutes after that I told them my throat was starting to close up, I was having trouble breathing and both arms went numb. They said I was very pale, horse when talking and that they were going to start treating me for anaphylaxis due to my throat and airway issues. They immediately called for ambulance and  gave me 10 ml of liquid Benadryl and prepped an epi-pen. Within maybe 5-10 minutes the Benadryl help stop the throat closing and I asked them to not inject the epi-pen until the EMT arrived since the symptoms held and didn?t get worse.

                                                Patient called my attention. Stated he was very hot. I could see he was sweating and pale. I asked if there was any itchiness or difficulty breathing. He replied no but he felt nauseous. I retrieved a trash can in case he vomitted but he did not. The feeling of nausea passed pretty quickly. I retrieved ice packs for his neck and wrists. he laid his head in his hand resting on the ice packs on his wrist. His first BP reading was 99/68... repeated in 10 minutes...about the same.I stayed with him &amp; had him put his feet up. We conversed through most of the event. Next reading was 110/74. His color was coming back a little but he was still hot and a little woosy. Patient gave me permission to call his supervisor.  I advised his supervisor he would benefit from going home to rest vs working the remainder of shift. I also contacted management to advise the same.  He stayed sitting for a total of @ 50 minutes. Two more BP readings were 106/74 and 108/74. I had him stand he said he was okay. He had to walk to back of store to get his belongings. I asked him to come back to pharmacy before leaving. He said he felt much better and had been okay walking  to back of the store.    I did call him # 2.5 hours later and he said he was feeling okay.  He did say that this has happened before..not always . I told him to let them know when he rec&#39;d 2nd dose.

                                                I received my second vaccination shot of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA around 9am on Friday April 30th. I was able to work throughout the day and then drove to see family in the afternoon, arriving around 5pm. Within an hour of arriving I began to feel a fever that continued to increase in severity. At various times throughout the evening I was laid up on the couch shivering and shaking without much control. I immediately took two ibuprofen pills and was able to eventually find a thermometer which read 102.7 degrees body temperature. My fever persisted through much of the night and partially broke around 4am. Still, the next day (Saturday 5/1) I still had a 101 degree fever and experienced aches and pains (presumably from the fever). As late as Sunday 5/2 I still had a fever of 100.1 but was feeling better. I did experience some minor and brief tightness in my chest on Sunday morning but it subsided quickly. Now 5/3 I feel better but still a bit hungover from the fever, shaking and lack of sleep.

                                                On Friday, April 2nd, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine.  Within minutes, my heart started racing and I felt faint.  Thereafter, my hands and face got the sensation of tingling.  It felt like ice was running through my veins.  My heart stopped racing approximately fifteen or so minutes after it began.  The tingling sensation in my hands and face ended approximately one hour later.  I also noticed a strange taste in my mouth during this same timeframe.  Subsequently, I had the sensation of being dizzy and lightheaded.  Importantly, I have never reacted to a vaccine in this manner.  On Saturday, April 3rd, I woke up with symptoms that were to be expected.  My arm was very sore and I felt a little achy.  However, I continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded.    That evening and for the next week or so, my heart was beating rapidly, and my blood pressure was elevated.  I also had the continuous feeling of my skin crawling.  My hands and feet also seemed to be experiencing tremors and twitching.    On Sunday, April 4th, I woke up and noticed that my right eye seemed a little blurry as I read an article on my phone.  I assumed I must have slept on my eye wrong and did not pay it much attention.  I do not recall my eye being blurry for the rest of the day.  The following morning on Monday, April 5th, I woke up once again feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  As I walked to the restroom, I noticed that my right eye was blurry again.  This time it seemed to be more pronounced.  Moreover, when I closed my right eye, I could see hundreds of dots in different colors.  In addition to having blurry vision, my legs felt weak and nearly buckled as I walked.  I felt like I was intoxicated.  Upon returning to bed, my teeth began chattering and I felt like I was freezing.  I called my doctor?s office and spoke with a PA who recommended that I go to the ER.    While I checked in at the ER, I could not remember my ZIP code.  I felt like my brain was not running on all cylinders.  Upon explaining my symptomology to the ER doctor, she recommended that I have my blood drawn and that I get an MRI to rule out a stroke.  All test results came back normal.    On Wednesday, April 7th, I made an appointment with an allergist.  They tested me to see if I was allergic to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and Polysorbate 80.  For the skin scratch portion of the test, neither of the substances had much of a reaction on my skin.  I thought the Polysorbate 80 scratch had a little bit of redness to it, but it was negligible.  When the doctor injected Polysorbate 80 under my skin with a syringe, a welt formed.  I am not sure why, but PEG was not injected in the same manner.  As a result of the test, the allergist confirmed that I am allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He mentioned that there may be instances of cross reactivity to PEG for individuals that are allergic to Polysorbate 80.  He recommended that I not get the second Moderna dose unless it was administered in a controlled setting.    On Sunday April 11th, I noticed what felt like a hard vein in my abdominal fat.  It felt slightly tender to the touch.  I was fearful that it could be a clot.  On Tuesday, April 13th, I woke up and as a I stood in the shower, my foot was painful to stand on.  On top of my right foot near my ankle, I could visibly see red inflammation in a vein.  I massaged the vein and the redness and pain dissipated.  Being fearful that I did have blood clots, I scheduled an appointment with a PA at my doctor?s office that same day.  We discussed my ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and me being fearful of blood clots.  She had an EKG performed at the office and ordered a barrage of blood tests.  Everything continued to be normal.    On Sunday, April 18th, I again went to the ER, because the hard vein in my stomach became larger and more tender to the touch.  When I bent over, it felt like there was a lot of pressure emanating from the hard vein down to my groin.  Once again, blood was drawn and everything was normal.  I also had an ultrasound performed on the area that felt like a hard vein and the doctor concluded that it was most likely swollen lymph nodes.  I was diagnosed with lymphadenopathy.    On Monday, April 26th, I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor to discuss the ongoing dizziness, lightheadedness, and pain in my stomach and groin area.  He told me that he had seen other patients that were experiencing similar symptoms and that my immune system was possibly overreacting to the vaccine.  He told me the symptoms should go away in time.  He also ordered a new blood test to check for clots.  The D-Dimer test came back normal.    On Tuesday, April 27th, I experienced a painful genital herpes outbreak.  I normally get one every year.  I had just recovered from an infection in December of 2020.  This outbreak was more intense and for the first time I had nerve pain that wrapped around my hip and down my inner thigh.  As of a week later, the infection is almost gone.      Today is May 4th, and I am still experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness.  Some days are better than others and every time I get optimistic that my dizziness and lightheadedness is finally gone, it reappears.  Being an IT consultant business owner and an attorney, I need to think clearly for my profession.  The side effects from the Moderna vaccine have made it very difficult to function.  I would like to get fully vaccinated, but I am fearful of getting the second shot.  I do not want the vaccine to cause permanent neurological damage or worse.    Finally, I am sure your organization is aware, but there are many other people experiencing the same symptoms as me.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 26-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 26-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle) (seriousness criterion medically significant), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement). At the time of the report, SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) was resolving.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications taken by the patient were not provided.  The reporter reported that patient never had any allergic reactions to vaccines or medications before and had no past medical histories for vasovagal reactions. After receiving the vaccine, the patient waited in the pharmacy for 15 minutes - 20 minutes. The patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement. The patient was out of it for 15-30 seconds. The reporter stated that she called 911.

                                                The pain in my arm has been severe since a few hours after the second dose shot. Range of motion is extremely limited. Symptoms are not reduced by extra strength Tylenol. Cold compress provides temporary relief of pain, but not increased range of motion.  Pain was less severe at the end of day 4, but has returned to very severe on the morning of day 5.  I am unemployed and uninsured so I have not been able to seek medical care.

                                                I noticed a tingling sensation on my in my left arm that goes goes about mid way from my bicep to my hand.  It is best described as when your hand falls asleep and your getting sensation back, that pins and needle feeling.  When condition first occurred I figured it may have been dry skin as I just got done on 5/23/2021 working heavily in the sun and had a mild sunburn.  I did not even apply skin lotion at this time.  I did not notice anything unusual on 5/24/2021 as I worked hard the day before and my arms were tired.  On 5/25/2021 I noticed it and it still felt like a tired arm but the tingling never left.  While it is not painful or debilitating it&#39;s presence is known and is uncomfortable.    I have held my arm up and performed other tests to rule out stroke.  AT this time I am reporting it and will continue to monitor the situation and alert you if it gets worse or gets better.

After getting the 2nd dose, I got sick the same way as the first dose. I was very cold and very weak. Thursday and Friday I&#39;m very sick. I felt fine Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, my right arm swelled up so much that it couldn&#39;t handle it&#39;s own weight. The pain got really bad and I had to go back to the dr. I get naproxen sodium to take with Tylenol. Thankfully that worked. My arm still didn&#39;t work until later that Tuesday evening. I would not have been able to make it to the Dr. if I had to drive myself. The doctor called it Moderna arm and said it was something he has seen a lot of. Here is when I find out that something is not right. My mind starts getting trouble. If we went through the same thing in the winter, my heater would not be able to keep the house warm enough. I hear about the booster and I just know I can&#39;t handle it. I am not sure what to do about that.

                                                Patient called the pharmacy  (6/5/21) to talk about his Moderna Covid vaccinations. He stated he felt drained and sluggish. He had his 1st dose on 5/5/21 and his 2nd dose on 6/2/21. In general he has had the following: Headache, dry mouth, body aches, nausea, and fatigue. I asked him how he felt  the day he called on 6/5/21 (3 days post his second dose). He stated that he still had a headache and was fatigued (he only felt like lying down). Patient is an employee here and wanted to know what he should do about returning to work. I referred him to store manager. I gave her his number and she was going to call him. He had spoken to managers before 6/5/21. I explained that these side effects are possible with vaccines and that some patients respond with more side effects than others or have a stronger response. However, I am filing  a VAERS because the patient mentioned that he had the following after his 2nd dose. He stated that about an hour after his vaccine on 6/2/21, he had hives and itching on his arms and neck and dry throat. He stated that he has used Benadryl and hydrocortisone to treat these symptoms. I asked him did he have any reaction after his 1st dose on 5/5/21. He stated that he had itching in his throat after the 1st one, but he thought it was just a dry throat and did not know if it was coming from the vaccine. As far as I know, 6/5/21 was the first day that the he had let anyone at the pharmacy know about any side effects. I told him to let his primary care doctor know this information that we discussed. I also recommended that he could take Tylenol if he wanted to do so.  Patient used a Doctor on Demand service through employee and provider prescribed aspirin 325 mg tablet once daily.

                                                After each shot I had an increased resting heart rate for more than 48 hours. Since that time I&#39;ve had a distinct reduction in cardiovascular capabilities in particular my heart rate while running has often gone up to very high rates. Additionally I&#39;ve had general fatigue and weakness since the vaccine particularly during exercise. I have data from my Garmin to support all of these symptoms and the correlation with the vaccine. The vaccine appears to have caused some sort of inflammatory reaction that is resulted in extended and potentially chronic fatigue and weakness.

                                                On April 1, 2021 the symptoms presented with right shoulder pain. Over the course of several days bilateral paralysis presented in the lower extremities.  On April 6, paralysis occurred in both hands/forearms. Then on April 7, bilateral facial paralysis was noted and was instructed to go to the local ER by PCP. A MRI of the brain and cervical region W/WO Contrast was performed along with spinal tap. On April 8, after a repeat MRI of the brain and cervical region, a diagnoses of Guillan Barre Syndrome was provided. April 8- April 12, 2021 IVIG therapy was administered while staying in the hospital. After the infusions were completed, I was moved to inpatient rehabilitation center on April 13. During my stay in the rehab unit I completed extensive therapy with OT/PT/SP along with neurophysiologist. I was discharged from hospital Rehab unit on April 22, 2021 (am). After discharge I was sent home and advised to continue outpatient therapy. I currently have paralysis in both legs, lower arms/hands, and right side of my face. I have been seeing a neruoopthamologist for my right eye as it can not close and is at risk for going blind. Currently I have not been given any sort of outcomes or time line as to when my condition should improve.

After I woke up on Saturday (Days#1) morning I felt weaker with muscle soreness, cold. Before noon, I wrapped my self with clothes and  slept.  My body Temperature measurement (using oral and touch thermometer) started  to increase from 99, 100, 101 to 102 F on multiple different occasions. I was able to eat but with minimal appetite.   Before eating I took Theraflu which contains 650 mg Tylenol it didn&#39;t work well. Until evening I took 2 tabs Tylenol 500 mg , slept for 4 hours,  woke up with sweat, feeling better not very weak and my temperature went down to 99 F.   Took another 2 tabs an hour later and woke up in the morning normal but little bit tired (Day#2).  Monday( Day#3) normal not my usual energy, but better than Day #2.

My skin was warm to the touch, body aches and pain and sniffles, lots of congestion and complete fatigue and severe muscle aches. I had a slight headache also but in the middle of the night 2/3 to 2/4 I woke up drenched from sweat and had to redress because my clothes were soaked.  On 2/4 I had to have the air on because I was so hot but never developed a fever.  On 2/5 I was still fatigue and still couldnt do much.  2/6 I still had arm soreness but felt better overall and by 2/7 all symptoms had subsided.

As a result I felt the need to go to bed early at about 9:30 PM. At about midnight I woke up with severe chills and intense body aches. I didnt get much sleep but the chills went away before 6:00 AM. The achiness remained but not as intense. I then had a migraine with a lost of appetite and more fatigue most of the day on February 10. Around 4:00 PM on the 10th all the symptoms suddenly started to leave and I began to feel normal.

EVERYTHING WAS FINE, PATIENT DIDN&#39;T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS/CONCERNS. I SAID I WILL CHECK ON HIM IN A FEW MINUTES. WITHIN MAYBE 1-2 MINUTES, HIS WIFE CAME TO THE COUNTER AND SAID HE IS OUT, PASSED OUT.  I WENT TO CHECK ON HIM. YELLED TO MY TECH TO CALL 911. PATIENT WAS SLUMPED OVER IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS BREATHING AND HAD A PULSE, BUT NOT AWAKE. TRIED TO AROUSE HIM BE CALLING HIS NAME AND SHAKING HIS ARM TO WAKE HIM. HIS WIFE THEN WAS TAPPING THE SIDE OF HIS FACE TO WAKE HIM UP. SKIN WAS GRAY IN COLOR. SHE STATED HE IS GOING TO VOMIT AS HE WAKES UP AND NEEDED A GARBAGE CAN. I WENT TO GRAB CAN FROM PHARMACY AND RETURNED. SHE PUT CAN IN BETWEEN HIS LEGS AS HE CAME TO AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO VOMIT. HE WAS AWAKE BUT OUT OF SORTS.  AT THAT TIME THE EMT ARRIVED AND WENT TO WORK. PATIENT BP WAS LOW AND THEY STARTED IV FLUIDS. THE PATIENT WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO EMT AND ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS. THEY PREPPED HIM FOR TRANSPORT TO THE EMERGENCY DEPT FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. BY THE TIME THE PATIENT WAS BEING TRANSPORTED, HIS BP WAS BACK UP CLOSE TO NORMAL.  I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PATIENT AND HIS WIFE AROUND 5PM THAT DAY. THEY WERE LEAVING THE HOSPITAL AT THAT TIME. THE PATIENT WAS FEELING MUCH BETTER. HIS BP WAS BACK TO NORMAL, HIS COLOR WAS BACK, AND HIS VOICE WAS STRONG. THEY BOTH PLAN ON RETURNING FOR THE COVID 19 DOSE #2.

                                                @ 3-5 min... arm started feeling a little sore, like a dead arm. That was the extent of things for a few hours.   @ 4 hours... randomly while doing absolutely nothing started getting short of breath &#43; breathing through a tube feeling &#43; drastically increased brain fog.   @ 11 hours... splitting headache &#43; arm at the injection site painful to the touch &#43; combination of pain/discomfort kept me awake all night despite my sleep Rx for insomnia.   @ 17-18 hours later... leg muscles were sore and achy and cramping if I stayed in any position for too long. Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

Only soreness in injection arm remained the next day.  Moderate/noticeable fatigue lasted until second day after vaccination, when soreness and fatigue were barely noticeable.

On 11 Mar 2021, anaphylaxis 3 minutes post receiving the first dose of vaccine the patient developed numbness and his eyes became swollen, then numbness of the tongue, lips and closing of the throat, which all happened at the vaccination site.The attending EMT provided 3 pills of oral 50mg Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and did not apply an EpiPen. Patient&#39;s blood pressure went extremely high (180/111mmHg) instead of dropping. At that moment, it was decided to contact 911. The paramedics placed the patient on a stretcher and loaded him onto the emergency vehicle to be rushed to the hospital. On the way, the patient was given an EpiPen. While in the hospital, the patient was given more diphenhydramine and injected with methylprednisolone. Patient was in observation for 4 hours and then released with a prescription of an EpiPen. It was reported that the patient was extremely sleepy due to the medications given. When the patient arrived home, he went straight to bed. The patient was hospitalized on 11 Mar 2021 for Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Pruritus and released on same day after 4 hours. The next day, Friday (12 Mar 2021) the patient got up around 10:00am. Then at 10:05am, the symptoms began to reoccur with numbness of the lips, tongue, closing of throat and extreme itchiness.

Then this past Monday (15 Mar 2021), patient started developing shortness of breath and a resting heart rate of 135bmp. That day, the patient was taken to urgent care.  There he was administered diphenhydramine and the patient&#39;s heart was checked. Urgent care agreed that his heart was acting up and his blood pressure was acting up for an unknown reason. Reporter states that the patient had been developing tachycardia for no reason for a week now. Since the tachycardia had occurred, reporter would check patient&#39;s oxygen (O2) levels. When the tachycardia had started, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation (O2 sat ) would drop as well. O2 levels were reported to be 88% and resting heart rate of 103bmp. The reporter would let 5 minutes pass, recheck, and everything would return to normal. On Monday (22 Mar 2021), patient is scheduled to see a cardiologist who will place the patient on a machine to check his heart rate for 3 days to see what is going on. Follow-up with various health care providers was scheduled for the rest of the week. Nephrologist will be seen on Monday, Neurologist will be seen on Tuesday, and Kaiser will be visited on Wednesday. Reporter stated that even though asked to run bloodwork and images, the emergency room did not do it.  Lab work was performed on Monday (15 Mar 021) which came back normal.

Specifically calves. Symptoms continued and I  went to sleep.  Next day fatigue and injection site pain continues but isn?t as bad

                                                Approximately 20 minutes following my vaccine I developed a numbness/tingling in the left side of my face.  There was no visible drooping but the sensation was notable.  It is still present two days later and may be diminishing but I am uncertain.  I would classify the reaction as mild but was concerning to me initially.  No treatment was completed and I intend to just wait it out.

                                                Patient received COVID vaccine and was advised to wait 15 minutes. 5 minutes later, the patient&#39;s wife comes asking for water and stated the patient was feeling dizzy. I approached the patient and asked questions regarding symptoms and he stated he &#34;lost consciousness&#34; for a few seconds and was sweating. I waited with the patient for 10&#43; minutes and asked if his symptoms were getting better. I made sure he was awake and responsive. The patient stated he was feeling tingly and &#34;amphetamine-like effect.&#34; A few minutes later he was pouring the water on his head and decided to lay on the ground. Based on his response, I called 911. After paramedics arrived and checked his condition, his symptoms improved. Based on discussion with paramedics, it looked to be like a panic attack to vaccination.

                                                I received the vaccine around 11am and did not experience any adverse reactions aside from a sore arm throughout the day.  I went to sleep at 10pm and was awakened at 3am with moderate soreness in my arm and I began to feel feverish and woozy.  About 2 minutes later I could tell that I was going to faint.  The thing I remember was waking up on the floor next to my bed with my wife holding me up.  She said that I started making sudden, loud guttural noises and she was afraid that I had been choking.  She reached over to touch my arm and my body jerked out of bed and I hit the ground.  When I woke up, I realized that I had fainted (I have passed out after a flu shot a couple years ago, but that incident happened about 15 minutes after injection) and my entire body was trembling and sweating profusely.  My wife left the bedroom to get me some water and a cold towel.  I got myself back into bed and passed out again.  The trembling and sweating continued but gradually decreased for about 15 minutes until I felt back to normal.  After I had calmed down, I felt no adverse symptoms and fell back asleep and have felt fine since the incident.

                                                I gave pt his Covid vaccine. Pt does not like needles, but he was fine after I gave pt his shot. His complexion was normal after the shot. The mother wanted pt to sit in the chair in the imz booth and I told them it was fine to have pt sit there as we didn&#39;t have anyone in line for shot.  Pt and mother move to one of the chairs that is reserved for post vaccinated pts.  A few minutes later tech called out for me as pt is going down from the chair.  I had tech dialed 911, came to the pt and trying to get him to be responsive.  Pt came to it after like 3-4 seconds.  Pt sat up and we offered him some water.  Per pt and mother, he had not had anything to eat yet.  So mother went and got pt some crackers. We got pt more water. They sat for a few more minutes and when he felt well enough they left.

                                                Around 6:30 pmI began feeling chills and incredibly tired.  I became sore all over and began shaking uncontrollably because of the chills.  I went to sleep around 7pm and woke up 20 minutes laterwith the worst fever I ever had.  I was extremely hot but when I lifted the covers I would immediately get cold.  I got out of bed around 3am because I was very thirsty and completly stuffed up in my head and sinuses.  I used vicks sinex and drank water and tea.  I was very cold when i got out of bed.  I went back to bed and woke up every 30 mins or so very hot and chilly when I lifted the covers.  I finally got out of bed at 6am.  At that point I had sweated through two shirts, my sheets and comforter.  When i got out of bed I was no longer chilly.  I had a mild headache, sinus pressure and soreness throughout my neck and shoulders.  Throughout the day (April 21, 2021) I would get chills and then get hot.  I continued to havce sinus pressure and a mild headache.  I went to bed around 8:30pm and woke up at 3:00am.  when I woke up I had sweated through half my shirt.  At the time of writing (April 22, 2021 @ 6:08am) I feel slight sinus pressure, no headache and get chills and hot from time to time.

Second week I?ve been dizzy. No appetite. Face tingling and numbness. Headache. I was Covid tested which was negative. Primary doctor has told me it?s neuralgia. Still have dizziness and on and off numbness in back of head and jawline. Sometimes my tongue going numb. An hour or two later my cheek will go numb. Very strange and very annoying. I?m still fatigued with no appetite.  Really hoping it starts to get better soon.

Pain radiated through body with slightest movement, felt in joints, muscles, bones.  Only alleviated by laying perfectly still.  Both injection sights became painful during this period, one in both arms.  Worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life, thought I might need to call ambulance and upon reflection, probably should have. Since then chills and sweating periods with minor exertion, getting less severe as time passes, but within norm.

These events were witnessed by bystanders and medical professionals. As of today, 24 hours later, tingling sensation all over body persists.

                                                Extreme pain in heels of both feet within 24hr of vaccine injection.  Difficulty walking and standing. Constant pain in both feet during daytime and nighttime.  Particularly acute pain in morning after sleep.  After 1-2 weeks, pain remained in heels of both feet, but also migrated into lower ankles.  Swelling was present from the beginning of the episode, but increased over time.  Pain and swelling abated 3 weeks after first vaccine dose for about a week.  Second vaccine dose occurred 3-29-21 and pain/swelling returned.  Pain in heels was still present at this time, but majority of pain migrated to ankles and achilles regions.  Swelling increased by week 5 to become obvious Edema.  Acupuncture did not help.  Stretching did not help.  Rest and elevating feet did not help.  Magnesium supplement may have helped relieve pain, but I am unsure. Compression sock did not help. Ibuprofen did relieve pain but not swelling.  By week 9, no relief from symptoms.  Podiatrist x-rayed affected areas and found no structural issues, but was concerned with Edema.  Administered steroid dosepack for 6 days.  Symptoms immediately abated.  No symptoms as of today.

He passed out shortly after that and his face hit the ground. His nose was bleeding a little bit. Right after notified by his friend I came to check on him and returned to the pharmacy to get the Epipen. When I came back, he was awake and lying on the ground and was able to speak. No Epipen injection was needed. The other staff pharmacist called 911 and one of our associates called 911 on her cell phone to report his breathing and consciousness (none reported or observed). His BP was checked at 12:27 pm with the reading of 127/78. At 12:31 pm, the reading was 121/78. The Emergency Ambulance staff came and checked his BP and blood sugar, then the patient was released and advised to get something to eat.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna vaccination at Publix pharmacy. He was instructed to remain in the area for 15 minutes for observation but he went to get something to drink with his wife. At checkout he fell and personnel was immediately called for assistance. When I arrived from the pharmacy to check on patient he was alert but clammy and covered in cold sweat. We removed his mask and called the EMS. Patient wanted to sit on the bench so he was escorted. He stated that he was feeling fine but he was very scared of needles which might have caused the incident. The EMTs arrived shortly after and took over the patient care. He was escorted out of the store by EMTs.

                                                I am a healthy 39 year old with no major health problems. About 2 weeks after my first vaccine dose I noticed a numbness that spread from my left low back to my left side and left front of my abdomen. It was accompanied by itching and and tingling. The doctor I talked to today said it was consistent with shingles and prescribed the antiviral Famciclovir. I don&#39;t know if it is connected to the vaccine, but I want to make sure that it is reported in case there is a pattern.

                                                Late last night, on top of feeling achy, itchy and tired, my arm started itching at the injection site. There was some pain, the area was raised and swollen and hot to the touch. For the past couple days, my armpits, groin and breasts were tender also. After I noticed the rash, I checked and my left armpit (injection arm) was considerably more swollen and tender than the right. Took two benadryl and went to sleep. Woke up and the red tenderness was all still there. I took one more benadryl and it has not spread.  Unfortunately it hasn&#39;t gone down much, either.

                                                Starting around 9:00pm with general malaise that developed into severe nausea and joint pain over next two hours. Pain was severe enough to bring tears. Began treating with Tylenol 650mg every 4-6hrs, which seemed to help initially. Starting around 11pm, I had severe chills with uncontrollable tremors lasting next 3-4hrs. Could not stop shaking, could not get warm. Intense joint pain continued. Was able to sleep intermittently from 2-3am, but awoke with return of severe nausea and vertigo/dizziness around 3am, accompanied by profuse sweating and hot flashes. I laid on cold tile floor with ice-pack on head/chest until it passed, about 30min, and nearly called for ambulance. Treated nausea by inhaling vapor from rubbing alcohol and taking a dose of zofran dissolving tab, which seemed to help. Able to sleep 4am-9am May 15th and return to normal diet. Malaise continued throughout 15th, but gradually subsided. Rashes in armpits and hot sweats night of 15th. I appear to be mostly normal as of today, May 17th.

During one trip to bathroom where bladder was drained, felt nauseated and light-headed. Got into position to vomit into toilet, and upon getting up, fainted. Spent the rest of the day with high levels of nausea, soreness, and headaches. At the end of the day, with more ibuprophen and pepto bismol, was able to sit up and interact. Food body would accept without nausea was crackers/toast. At end of the night, left shoulder was swollen and red around injection site, radiating out approximately 4in.

The headache last to Saturday night. Saturday night as the headache faded I became nauseous and vomited.   By 36 hours after the vaccine (around midnight Saturday) I felt much better and was finally able to eat after not being able to all day. On Sunday I was tired but could function, and by today (Monday), I am fully better.

                                                1 week after the second dose, I was exercising in the early morning when suddenly my vision and hand-eye coordination were flashing, my hand appeared in a different position than where I thought it was. I tried to tell my sons to get help, but I couldn&#39;t say any words, just some repetitive mumbling. I was able to walk upstairs but couldn&#39;t speak for about 10 mins, and then everything was coming out slowly. It was about an hour before I could resume normal talking. I went to the hospital, where they gave me a CT scan, MRI, heart echo, and eventually a TEE. They said that I had a Transient Ischemic Attack, and they found a PFO in my heart that probably allowed a blood clot to travel to my brain.  They also did an ultrasound of my legs when I mentioned the timing of the vaccine, to make sure there were no other clots. I am taking baby asprin and crestor, and have an heart event monitor now for 30 days. I am also scheduled for more bloodwork and a pelvic scan. They say it is likely that they will want to close my PFO, but want to see all the test results first to rule out any other possible causes.

                                                Patient has no clotting history. He developed body aches, left arm pain, and fevers immediately after immunization, but improved. Two days later on 6/2, he developed left flank pain and fevers.  On 6/4, he was evaluated in the ED, with CT scan showing partially occlusive thrombosis of left renal artery with areas of renal infarction. Cr remained stably at baseline. Initial workup was otherwise notable for WBC 17 and negative infectious workup. He was initiated on therapeutic Lovenox.  On 6/5, CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed to evaluate for other clots. Left renal artery was complete thromboses with evolving foci of renal infarction. No other clots were detected. He continued to have fevers. By 6/8, his leukocytosis, fever, and flank pain resolved.  Renal ultrasound with doppler showed restoration of some flow in the left renal artery. He is to be discharged 6/9 on Lovenox 1mg/kg BID without patient Hematology follow-up.  His coagulability workup was notable for positive LAC, FVII deficiency, and PET/CT without evidence of occult malignancy.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA.  After my second dose of the Moderna COVID19 vaccine I started with the same reaction as the first, a mildly sore arm.  After showering at the end of my day I was hit by fever and chills, this is around 12:30 am, not an unusual time for me to be up.  Fever broke around 5am, shortly after I was feeling better and ready for food.  My girlfriend and I then set out on a long drive (we had been visiting family and were now heading home), I was fatigued but who wouldn&#39;t be after a feverish night.  Due to a stressful driving experience (she was driving not me for obvious reasons) we decided not to do the 10hr drive in one shot.  We checked into a hotel around 8:30pm and I got hit with a fever and chills again.  Why I&#39;m making this report:  My girlfriend (who had not just gotten a vaccination) agrees with me that the locations where I got worse were cold (at least to us).  We are accustomed to this heat and our home is set at 78 degrees F.  The Hotels we stayed in were set a 72; I don&#39;t have a lot of fat, not ill I still shiver at 72.  IS IT POSSIBLE COLD ENVIRONS CAN EXACERBATE SIDE EFFECTS?

After these symptoms eased, no appetite (went from eating five times a day and gym workouts 5 days a week to maybe eating twice a day and unable to walk up 20 stairs without shortness of breathe and heavy erratic heartbeats) still accompanied with little energy, erratic heartbeats, shortness of breath, and lingering headaches well into week three.  Admitted myself to the ER on due to lingering affects and a new symptom of swelling/throbbing on the left side of my head; previous mentioned symptoms still there but milder than before.  Diagnosis at ER was high blood pressure 150 over 92; never had blood pressure problems prior 1st COVID vaccine dose. Follow-up visit with primary care provider, checked my vitals and high blood pressure remained; primary care provider diagnosed high blood pressure, prescribed Amlodipine 5MG tablets.

I was not able to lift the same amount of weight nor stay on a cardio machine as I once did (I exercise daily).  It never improved.  After my second shot on 2/9/21 I began to develop symptoms of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis).  I was awaking up at night, drinking a 40oz bottle of water and urinating every hour during hours of sleep.  I lost a significant amount of weight as well (I was questioned at work about it).  I have no family history of diabetes and I have always been lean and fit.  I went to the doctor on 2/27/21 because symptoms became overwhelming.

                                                Vaccine 1 side effects: Felt like giant jujube (a rod but gummy like) was in my arm but got smaller as days progressed. Hurt if touched the area. By Day 6 the rod felt smaller than a regular sized jujube and after that it was gone.  Vaccine 2 side effect Had 102 fever next day but felt OK the preceeding day. Arm where injection was also itches a little from time to time, but not as much as it did the day after getting the Vaccine.

They gave me a check up. I had paralysis in my left hand and was not able to move it. I was taken to the ER and had to do motion tests. I am able to move it now, but I have difficulty. I still have pain in my hand and arm.
