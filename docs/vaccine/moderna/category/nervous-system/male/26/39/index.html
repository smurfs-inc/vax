                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

                                                Initially, around 1500hrs on Monday, January 4th, roughly 40 minutes after the injection, I developed a scratchy throat, a headache, and nausea.  I got home from work, and having no appetite due to nausea, I fell asleep on the couch around 1800hrs. Severe fatigue had set in. I did not wake up until 0500hrs the next morning to go to work on January 5th. I felt like I had not slept at all, however the scratchy throat had gone away. I worked all day with the nausea and headache. Throughout the day I developed chills, cold sweats, diarrhea, fever, and I felt like my mind was foggy (I had felt feverish since Monday night, but Tuesday was the first time I took my temperature that showed I had a fever.) I went home that night and slept all evening and well into the next morning. On the morning of Wednesday, January 6th, my symptoms had again gotten worse, so I called my primary care physician. He fit me in and tested me for the flu and for COVID. He prescribed me Ibuprofen for the headache/fever, and Ondansetron for the nausea/vomiting. My flu test came back negative on Thursday, January 7th, and my COVID test came back negative on Friday, January 8th. The fever finally broke on Friday evening and Saturday, January 9th  was the first day I woke up without a fever.  I still have the headache as of today, January 11th, and a low grade fever has returned. I am still very fatigued as well.

Rash started in chest/upper torso and progressed to bilateral arms, back, upper buttocks, and thighs. Rash feels like a sunburn in that it makes the subject feel warm. Rash is blanchable and fully pinpoint-macular, no papules or plaques.   At approx. 36 hours post-vaccine, the rash had spread down both arms and up the neck, sparing the face. The rash gets intensely pruritic when scratched or itched. There is no pain, shortness of breath, altered mental status, or other compromise of the subject&#39;s health or well-being.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Vaccine administered 3/11/21 at public health pop-up clinic. Sore arm from night of vaccine through day 5. Beginning on day two, extreme muscle twitching, spasms, and involuntary movements. This lasted until day 8. Starting on day 3, daily persistent cranial pressure, right eye pressure, and ear pressure. This persists today (day 26). On day 4, heart rate noticeable heart rate increases, palpitations, and chest tightness. This persists today (day 26).   On day 7, I woke up early AM and upon trying to fall back asleep, had what felt like 4-5 seizures before finally falling back to sleep. Upon waking up, right side of body was weak, tingling; right eye vision was blurry and right ear was muffled. Decided to go to ER after 2-3 hours of consistent symptoms. Admitted for observation, routine labs completed, normal. Brain CT w/o contrast, unremarkable. Symptoms persisted into next day, brain MRI WWC performed, unremarkable. ER docs and specialists (neurologist/cardiologist) implied that it could be related to vaccine, as no history of any such symptoms or disease and the temporal association with vaccine administer. Was discharged and told to follow up with PCP, neurologist, cardiologist.   Have since been in and out of doctors appointments(PCP, neurologist, cardiologist), labs drawn weekly, and several follow up imaging/labs. No doctor so far can figure out a clinical problem, but several symptoms persist or worsen as time goes on. As of now, right side weakness/tingling considered RESOLVED. Cranial/ear/eye pressure considered UNRESOLVED. Chest tightness, heart rate increases considered UNRESOLVED.

                                                About 2-5 minutes after receiving shot I felt a twitch/bubbling feeling in the left side of my face. I immediately started getting anxiety and my hands began to sweat. I also started getting a mild pain in my lower spine. Which is still persisting today (2 days later). Yesterday I was pretty tire and had aches all day that came and went. It was very hard to work from home but I managed to work 6 hours with breaks. Also yesterday and this morning when I got out of the shower I noticed 2-3 itchy red bumps on my stomach area. I?m not sure if I had a mild allergic reaction to the vaccine. Either way, I will most likely contact my doctor before I get my second dose. I hear the second dose is more intense which makes me hesitant as the first dose debilitated me quite a bit.  I am usually very healthy and have never had any allergic reactions which makes this puzzling. The only thing that comes to mind that may have caused this is mushroom immune supplement. Any info will be much appreciated, thanks.

                                                I received the 2nd vaccine at 1:30pm, by 8:30pm I was extremely fatigued and went to bed early. I woke up in the middle of the night (around 12:00AM) with terrible night sweats, chills, a fever of 101, a terrible headache (completely different from my migraines) and my arm was extremely sore and painful. I tried to avoid taking any medication as I heard that it could decrease the efficacy of the vaccine, but it became unbearable so I took ibuprofen around 3:00am. My symptoms lasted throughout the next day, the fever subsided after the first dose of ibuprofen however I still had chills and the headache. The chills finally subsided around 3:00pm and the headache did not subside until I woke up Friday (2/5/21) morning around 6:00am which was roughly 42 hours after my second dose was administered.

Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

                                                Soreness in left arm, fever with chills, aches, and shakes lasted most of the night after the dose. The next day, had mild chills and moderate aches. Symptoms improved and I was mostly able to do regular daily activities by the afternoon. Fever broke the 2nd night. I have felt fine since.

                                                During the first day after taking vaccine, started having a fever, headache, and sore throat. By the evening, fever was severe and 102&#43;, with severe headache and sore throat. After sleeping on that nigh (had disruption of sleep from 2 - 4 in the morning), it was looking normal., just had usual fatigue after a fever. But on Thursday (Took vaccine on Tuesday morning, March 02, 2021), I suddenly started having a seizure, my whole body was shaking, legs were cramping. I thought it was going to go away, but after 10 minutes it was getting worse and I had to call the emergency services. The fire service members first came, they measured my blood oxygen level, it was 98%, but my blood pressure was high (140). I was still shaking and having the seizure. They tried to calm me down by talking, after some time, my blood pressure came to normal and I started getting normal (no seizure at that point). I declined the ambulance service as it is expensive and I was getting normal. I had a 101 fever just after that and went to visit the health care facilities .

The hospital was of no remedy to me. One doctor even boldly claimed that she wasn?t there so they can?t necessarily say I had a seizure. I received no medications and left the hospital with no CT scan.

Over the next day or two I began to notice persistent weakness of the 4th and 5th digits on my left hand to abduction, adduction, flexion, and extension.  Over the weekend the weakness improved slightly, but has not improved much in the past few days.  I am also still occasionally experiencing the tingling sensation in the same distribution.

He was able to cushion his fall so that he did not have any broken bones, bleeding etc.  He said he felt weak and tired.  I had to help him up from the floor.  He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

I went to bed at 9:30pm and woke up at 2:00am unable to move my left arm due to severe pain, a pounding headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and minor nasal congestion. I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep the remainder of the night due to the pain. All symptoms persisted the morning and afternoon of the 21st as well. The severe arm pain subsided but I still struggled to lift my arm past 90 degrees without intense pain. I went to bed on the 21st unable to rest on my left shoulder due to the pain and woke up the 22nd with most symptoms gone except for a minor headache and moderate soreness in the left arm.

Alternating between chills and being overheated on and off all night, while headache became worse. Had to take ibuprofen at 7:30 AM after not being able to sleep, and was able to sleep. Woke up at 1 PM and had to take another ibuprofen for the headache. Chills were gone, but was overheated and sweating for an hour or two. Had to take another ibuprofen at night, but headache wasn&#39;t too much worse. Headaches were gone upon waking up at 9 AM on Sunday.  Experienced lymph node swelling in armpit of arm that got the vaccination. Tried to do pushups, but became too painful. I had also experienced the lymph node swelling after my first vaccination 28 days before my second one. About a week after, and they always felt minorly swollen up until the time of my second vaccination. I didn&#39;t know they were caused by the vaccine until after the second vaccination.  Currently 1:20 AM on Monday, and I have been experiencing redness and itching in a large patch around the vaccination site all day.

                                                Patient lives with family in private residence with parents and 2 siblings. Spends most of time in own room. First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

He is compliant with medication and did not have another provoking factor.  Approximately 6 hours after receiving the vaccine he had a generalized seizure, which was witnessed by his wife. He had an aura, behavioral arrest, tonic-clonic activity for 1 minute followed by a post-ictal period of several hours. This is consistent with his known seizures, but the provocation appears to be the vaccine he received earlier in the day.

He notes he was not until approximately 1.75 hours after vaccination that he began to develop a runny nose and aching primarily in his arm.  He felt this might be normal but then soon after developed a hot itchy tight feeling in his throat with ongoing rhinorrhea, mild tightness in breathing and soreness in his left arm. He has had similar reactions with Remicade in the past and they became severe and that is why he is no longer using Remicade.

I have not had covid and have not been sick since pandemic started. The following morning I woke up with a fever of 101 and extreme arm pain. As the morning progressed, I continued to have increasing fever even after taking Tylenol 500mg every 4-6 hours. My fever peaked at 104.7 by 3pm on 1/20, then started to come down after taking 400mg of ibuprofen. By 9pm on 1/20, my fever started to spike again and then I took more inbuprofen. As of 1/21, I am still having symptoms of being unwell and nausea, as well as low grade fever of 101. I do not have any covid symptoms (no cough, no loss of taste).

                                                I received it at 10am and around 2am that night I started to have a bad headache and body aches. I would fall asleep for a bit but then at 4am I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was so unbearable that I would clinch my eyes shut. Bones and muscle pains all over. Violent hot/cold flashes. I would feel hot all over and after a minute or so of placing a cold pack on my head I began to shiver despite sweating. Around 5am I was looking at my phone wondering if I should go to the ER because I legitimately felt like I was in danger.  The unbearable headache lasted a total of 14 hours from its onset. No OTC medications were taken.  Around 6pm on day 2 from the dose the intensity of the headache began to subside VERY slowly.  I woke up on day 3 completely fine as if nothing happened.

They begin vomiting and sweating heavily within 30 minutes after the vaccine. They felt very dizzy and were unable to walk from the clinic to their car and had to find a ride home from the facility. They were unable to return to their shift that evening.

                                                Developed a sizable rash in the deltoid which started a little more than 24 hours after the injection. This only occurred after my second dose. The rash was dark red, was warm to the touch, and felt tight. No increased pain or itching. I took a antihistamine the following day and these seemed to help reduce the rash. It was gone after 4 days.

He reports he has not had any symptoms to the right eye, itself. He states he has some mild facial drooping involving his right upper eyelid and his right cheek. He reports mild swelling under his right eye, as well as to his right cheek area. He also reports that he can?t fully open his right eye, which impairs his field of vision; otherwise, denies any vision changes. Instructed that the symptoms were suggestive of Bell?s Palsy, but to go straight to ER for further evaluation.

                                                At approximately 930 am, Offender was vaccinated in Housing Unit and returned to his bed. He was monitored by nursing staff for 15 minutes and had no adverse reaction or side effects. At approximately 1030am, Offender  was called to the officer&#39;s desk and was told to report to the visiting room for vaccination. Upon arrival, offender  was again vaccinated in the opposite arm. Offender was called in error rather than his room mate was who was an add on to the vaccination list. Offender was admitted to the Health Care Unit for observation for 24 hrs. Vital signs remained stable throughout this period with only a complaint of bilateral sore arms.  There were nono additional sequelae. Office of Health Services was notified of the incident on February 25, 2021 and began a review as part of our quality improvement process and in order to recommend practice modifications, provide education, implement policy change, monitor outcomes and prevent re-occurrence.  OHS reviewed information obtained from Moderna regarding the management of vaccine administration errors.  The error at facility is known as an &#34;invalid dose&#34;.  In general there is limited information, yet low risk, for individuals who either receive a second dose within 21 days or a higher than authorized dose volume. The recommendations in this guidance related to the facility occurrence are summarized:  Second dose administered in &lt; 21 days  Do not repeat dose. Higher than authorized dose volume administered  Do not repeat dose. *  Inform the recipient of the potential for local and systemic adverse.    Additional recommendations from the process:   1. Identity verification.  There were several opportunities for Health Care Staff, Security Staff, and  Guardsmen to confirm the identify of Offender. a. All offenders must wear their ID throughout all steps of the vaccination process.   b. Health Care Staff, Security Staff, andGuardsmen must verify offender identities as needed for their assignments throughout each step the vaccination process c. Health care staff must verify accurate completion of offender vaccination forms and ensure that forms match the offender being vaccinated.  d. Health care and Security staff must identify offenders by offender name and number rather than housing assignment. e. Use of handwritten lists should be minimized.  Other pre-printed available rosters or spreadsheets are preferable 2. Offender completed two sets of consent forms for vaccination.  It is unclear if he did not understand the process, or exactly why he would repeat the vaccination process.   a. Though language did not appear to be an issue, appropriate interpreters should be made available to obtain consents and provide education. b. When necessary consent forms should be provided in the native language spoken by the offender. c. It is unclear why there was no further attempt to confirm that Offender had previously received a vaccination that day, after stating that fact to those present before he received his second dose of vaccine. In the future, if an individual states that he or she has already been vaccinated the process must stop until his or her claims have been verified or shown to be false. 3. Any unplanned changes to the onsite vaccination plan (add-ons, extra dose redistribution, team deployment etc.) must be communicated to all members of the vaccination team.  4. Health care staff alone are responsible for the completion of all consent forms and vaccination documentation.   5. Identify best practices and standardize vaccination add-ons across facilities. Consider: location, addition to master vaccination roster, etc. a. Perhaps add-on vaccinations can be moved to another area for tracking. b. Add-ons should be added to the master vaccination roster.  Additional recommendations: 6. Re-Training on the vaccination protocol for health care, operations and national guard staff.    The above items were completed.

He became diaphoretic, thousand yard stare, limbs stiff, and then slumped for less than 5 seconds while sitting. He was lowered to the ground and legs elevated, supplemental oxygen provided. He came to within 15 seconds of initial symptoms. He stated he felt hot and ?woozy.? Vital signs: BP 107/69, HR 88, SpO2: 99, Resp: 16, temp 98.8. Blood glucose 127. Patient states he was out in the sun the day prior and did not hydrate as he should have. Cool water was provided and he received 500mL of saline IV.  Patient was monitored for 2 hours post episode and was released back to work feeling good without any further issues. Patient stated he had a previous sync opal episode upon receiving some anxiety producing news in the past and states that this episode felt similar.

                                                The following day I became increasingly fatigued, roughly 30 hours later I took a 2 hour nap. I awoke and had dinner, about 5 minutes after finishing my heartbeat felt &#39;regularly irregular&#39; and was 55 bpm, which is normal for me at rest. I became nauseous, dizzy, full-body tingling, laid on the floor near the toilet for about 20 minutes. My wife reported my lips became purple and I was pale.  I assumed it was hypotension (vasovagal?) of some kind as I&#39;ve had this happen after blood draws in the past. I drank a bunch of water to get my blood pressure up and smelled peppermint oil to decrease nausea. I was okay thereafter, but I slept around 13 hours that night.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

I only historically had gotten a total of 4 flu vaccines. 24 hours after Moderna I had b/l dorsal foot tingling that I didn?t really pay any mind to, then by the next day it spread to L hand (4th-5th digit) overt weakness and paresthesias and a cool/numb feeling to my R thumb. Similar symptoms to L 5th toe and R great toe. As days progressed it got more diffuse and extended up to mid-calf that was very mild... eventually by day 10 it dissipated, thank god.  To add I also experienced L facial dull pain and the distal portion of my tounge felt like I burnt it (lasted 5 -7 days)

At about 1030AM I had a very bad headache and was extremely nauseous for about 3 hours and felt like vomiting but did not vomit. This went away at about 1230pm and I felt my tongue get cold and a metallic taste which went away within the hour of onset. The nausea, headache, and metallic taste was gone at about 1-2pm on 1/11/21. I had a sore left arm on the injection site, which is to be expected and went away within 3 days. On 1/18/21 around 1pm, my arm started to feel itchy at the exact site of the injection from 1/11/21, and there is now (1/18/21) a red rash like appearance on that left arm where the Moderna covid vaccine was injected. Possible delayed local allergic reaction.

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

                                                I developed periumbilicus cramping abdominal pain, nausea for two days after first shot then it went away. After second shot, I developed the usual thing of arm soreness, fever, chills, joint pain and generalized body aches as well as GI symptoms. All symptoms went away in two days except that I have had persistent symptoms of cramping abdominal pain, on/off nausea, bloating. I still have the symptoms 4 weeks after the shot and nobody knows what is going on.  I lost around 15 lb till now and will be following with my PCP soon to see what is next.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night with a fever, took 400mg of ibuprofen to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I felt mostly normal, so I took my Bupropion dose (150mg) and drank a cup of coffee. I exercised and went to the gym. When I got back I noticed my heart rate while resting was 130. This persisted into the night. I felt tired, weak, unfocused, and cold at night again. It is possible I had a slight fever again. 48 hrs after my second vaccine, I still have a high resting heart rate (90) which goes up to 120 whenever I move. It is as though I am exercising. I feel like I could jump up and run at any moment. I do not feel fatigued today thankfully. The high heart rate with fatigue is what worried me most.

These were not the typical &#34;shivering&#34; symptoms typically experienced by patients with high fever.  All other symptoms experienced following severe symptoms more closely resembling flu-like symptoms that are to be expected following second vaccine.

I woke up around 6:30 with a headache and chills. throughout the morning, my headache worsened as did my chills. I felt fatigued and noticed my lungs felt the same as they did when I had COVID. Essentially all my COVID symptoms came back I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I slept most of the morning and then felt nauseous around 3 pm. I vomited around 3:30 and almost felt completely better after that. My headache, chills, and fatigue were still present but significantly less once I vomited. In the morning I woke up with a headache that lasted through the morning the second day after vaccine administration. By the end of the second day, I felt completely fine. My arm soreness was almost completely gone. I also had some aches and chills on the second day in the morning upon waking up but those were gone by mid-day. On day three I feel completely fine.

                                                Approximately two to three minutes after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, my face began feeling flush. I also felt a tingling sensation in my face and neck, and I began sweating profusely. I walked up to one of the rescue/paramedic staffers and told them that I had a &#34;flush&#34; feeling in my face. The paramedic asked me a few questions about how I was feeling, then a second paramedic brought a wheelchair. I sat in the wheelchair and was brought to a separate room. The second paramedic noted that I was covered in sweat. The second paramedic and I decided to remove the top layer of my clothing (a polo shirt) because it was drenched in sweat. After about 10 or 15 minutes of sitting in the wheelchair and focusing on my breathing, the tingling/sweating sensation subsided and I was able to walk back into the observation area. I felt a second &#34;wave&#34; of sweating/tingling come over me a few minutes later, but it was minor compared to the first &#34;wave,&#34; and did not require additional attention from the paramedics.

                                                On the day of vaccination my arm was sore but at night i had a fever, chills, muscle aches and headache associated with insomnia. Symptoms started to get worse the next day of vaccination as I was hardly moving my left arm and i had to get off work early because i couldn&#39;t stand on my feet for a long time. finally on the third day symptoms started to improve.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

                                                Received intramuscular injection in right arm at approximate 9:30am.  Remained seated for 15 minutes per instructions from clinic personnel.  Finished a conversation at left the facility after approximately 9:55am. While driving back to office (appx 5 minute drive total), experienced clammy skin, sweating at 3 minutes into drive.  I considered pulling over, though I knew I should be around people where I could be monitored, so continued on. Experienced elevated temperature, blurriness of vision and my vision began to turn bright and white.  As I pulled into the parking lot, I thought I may be passing out.  I got out of the vehicle, sat down on the nearest bench and asked two individuals who where outside to stay with me, and I explained my symptoms to them.  I remained seated for approximately 10 minutes, and when I felt the symptoms subside, went into my office and am now filing this report.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine first dose. Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, i became dizzy, tachycardic and experiencing hot flashes. Me thinking it was in my head did not say anything i waited the 15 minutes and left the vaccination area. The feeling i got seemed to go away and i thought everything was good and was my way home.  About 30 minutes after injection i began experiencing itching in the face, nausea, dizziness, i was pale as a ghost. Having felt this before it was just like my allergic reaction i get when i ingest shellfish. I stupidly continued on my way home when i should have went to an ER but nonetheless i made it home and took some benedryl about 30 minutes later my symptoms subsided. I also took my blood pressure when i arrived home and was hypotensive. By the next day was fully recovered and no problems since day of injection.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                Around 12 hours after the second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine I experienced the expected severe fever, chills, and rigors.  This eventually subsided to a large extent by hour 30; however at hour 36 I slightly bent over to pick up an item from my nightstand and felt what seemed to be a pulled muscle in my left back.  I immediately went to bed and awoke with severe muscle spasms in that same area.  The muscle spasms continued lying, standing, and sitting.  Nothing relieved them and they were intermittent brought on spontaneously and also by movement.  I could not perform most daily functions and sought medical attention at the local urgent care.  There they diagnosed it as a thoracic myofascial strain.  They prescribed me cyclobenzaprine which helped decrease the frequency but not completely alleviate the spasms.

It was only on the side of my face that Moderna covid vaccine was given. It ended up going away after 4 hours or so. The next day I had normal reactions to the shot for someone that had covid such as low fever, muscle inflammation, aches, and this brain fog, chills in my sleep.

                                                I am a board certified infectious diseases pharmacist and I have given lectures over hypersenstivites reactions. I noticed itching at the injection site a little more than 72 hours s/p injection with some minor itching. This progressed over the next 20 - 40 minutes to severe itching with large erythematous rash to the the left axillary region, then shoulder,  and chest. Then hives developed pretty aggressively to majority of body including neck, back, inner thighs, and bilateral legs. The next morning I woke up to severe myalgias feeling like I was hit by a truck with soreness this resolved after roughly 24 hrs. Pain worse in buttocks, quadriceps, and sharp left lower mandible pain.  On 01/02 around 7:30 pm took Hydrocorticone 100 mg PO x 1 and 50 mg of diphenhydramine q4h and the allergic reaction resolved over the next several hours.  Still having upper torso itching going on 3 days after allergic reaction and 6 days after injection. Continued diphenhydramine 25 mg twice daily keeps the itching tolerable.

                                                Very sore arm. Started on my shoulder, moved to the rest of my left arm after I was working for about half an hour. I took two ibuprofen and it all stopped aside from soreness around the injection point. Which is still a little sore now at 11:10.  I also had some dizziness around 3:30 pm (2&#43; hours after receiving the shot)

Followed by back and neck muscle spasms causing pain at any slight movement. Telemedicine visit to doctor suggested the sore throat was something viral (not Covid), and that it should go away. Two PCR tests were negative for Covid. Muscle pain has not been addressed yet, as I cannot make an appointment until I have been symptom-free for 72 hours.

This pain dissipated 48 hours after injection. Pain returned 6 days after injection, on Monday the 8th. Pain was in the lower portion of the left arm and in the calf muscle of left leg. In my opinion, this cannot be explained by any other physical activities.

                                                Ith the first vaccination I had upset stomach and clamy forehead about an hour after vaccination. Then within a 3 week time period I kept getting sicker then, the day after my second dose (which caused me no reaction, which I thought was weird as everyone reported that one having more side effects) I had become so sick that I went to the ER and found I had diabetic ketoacidosis.  It runs in my family to have type 2 but later in life. What was also strange is that Inhad a physical not long before the vaccine through my PCP Dr. and my A1C labs came back elevated but within normal limits....

He called his mother and told her that he was sick to his stomach with cramps and that he was throwing up blood.  The girlfriend found him on the floor on the 21st dead on the floor in his hotel room at 8:00 AM.  The girlfriend said she had spoken with him around 10:00 PM and that he said he was going to sleep on the floor in the bathroom as he was throwing up and the floor was cool.  She subsequently found out that he was throwing up blood, and autopsy report showed that his stomach was full of blood and further testing is being done to see what has caused the bleeding.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

On Sunday I had the same symptoms but I noticed a sharp pain in my back. By Sunday evening I started to feel pain on right side of back in the middle of my back felt like it was my ribs at first. The pain elevated as the evening went on to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand for too long or sit.

                                                After a night of being up with flu like symptoms, when I got out of bed at 7 am to start my day, I had a precipitous fall in body temperature.  At this time, I also had profuse cold sweats, my limbs started getting cold, I could not see or hear and had ?stars? like I was about to pass out.  My wife helped me downstairs and after some water and Tylenol, symptoms reversed themselves in about 15 minutes.  My body temperature was not recognized by the thermometer and then registered 93.4

This is not a report of the typical soreness after a shot.  Concern for tendonitis/shoulder injury from the shot itself or a complication thereafter.  I have been taking ibuprofen around the clock.  The normal soreness after the shot started around 12 hrs.  These subsequent pain/weakness issues continued on after that point

Then still chills and insomnia. Fever that persisted over the next 36 hours. Responded well to Ibuprofen 400mg for 4.5 hours until symptoms returned. Began alternating with Acetominophen 650mg for better effect. Fever was highest (recorded) at 102.2 F 29 hours after injection. Woke up 40 hours from vaccine after a night of sleep and with reduced fever. Still going up and down a bit off any medication. Last reading 46 hours from vaccine 100.6, but two hours earlier was 99.4. I?ve also had nausea, exhaustion, and tiredness. Also cold symptoms which may be related to the slight cold I had the morning of the vaccination that I didn?t think was anything to worry about - my kid is in daycare and I feel like this for a large part of the winter!

The symptoms haven&#39;t felt serious but I&#39;m hearing approximately 60% of individuals I speak with are experiencing the same or worse symptoms.  I worry that individuals won&#39;t want to receive their 2nd shot due to the reported side effects.  I believe more awareness should be communicated to the general public, so they aren&#39;t caught off guard.   I had a covid test conducted on Friday (negative) and will get another one this week to be certain I do not have covid.

We monitored him for over an hour and during that time, he continued to c/o dizziness, frontal headache, photophobia, and worsening when opening his eyes are trying to look straight ahead. We had him isolated in a dim room and had air blowing on him as he complained of being hot. His O2 Sat, pulse , and BP all stayed stable and within normal range. Pt. denied sx of swelling around face/neck or difficulty breathing. RR was stable and unlabored at all times. Pt. refused EMS services and after some time, insisted he needed to get up and leave. Our staff and his co-worker assisted him out of the facility and to a vehicle where we was transported off the premises.  We were informed later through his supervisor that he got worse after leaving and went to the hospital where he &#34;seized.&#34; He is reportedly stable at this time but further information on his condition is unavailable.

The pain in my lower back is serve, I couldn&#39;t really stand up straight. I have had to miss a few days of work. I have talked to a family friend who is a Doctor and he said it should only last for a 1-2.

The day after I received the vaccine I was very tired feeling, my left arm very sore, and I noticed my heart rate was staying higher. At one point at work my heart rate went up to 140 bpm. I went to the doctor after work and was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia. I was prescribed metoprolol for tachycardia. I do not know what caused my heart rate to increase, but the metoprolol has my rate controlled now. I felt the fatigue lasted about 3-4 days and then I was back to normal.

                                                Very sore arm, fatigue within hours of the vaccine. Then 6th day (morning) throat swelling and face when waking up and rushing to the emergency room where I was given a steroid and Pepcid to open my airways and was discharged by 9:30 AM ET on 03/10/2021 after throat opened back up and swelling decreased. I was given a script for EPI, Medrol Pack and Pepcid. Upon returning home I had began having hiccups at 8 PM that lasted through Saturday 03/12/2021, where I was admitted to the hospital for a lot of antihistamine rash reactions over my body that continued from the morning of 03/10/2021. Then went to the hospital again on 03/13/2021 and was given a muscle relaxer baclofen around 7 PM to rid the constant hiccups that were concurrent from what seemed to be the steroid used to open my airways. Went home and have had fatigue, but feel mostly better with appetite back. My family doctor saw me on 03/16/2021 and saw that I was still having a reaction on my back and arms with antihistamines and said it was the Moderna shot and I needed to consult with a pharmacist on what to do or the FDA/CDC as he didn&#39;t know enough on it. Now Pharmacy won&#39;t give me my second dose due to the CDC guidelines and they want me in a medical setting to have the second one, if I am allowed - something I am not privy to. I need help and guidance ASAP on what to do.

This case concerns a 37-year-old female with serious unexpected events of pharyngeal swelling, lip swelling, mouth swelling, swelling, muscle spasms, hiccups, and nonserious expected events of pain in extremity, erythema, fatigue. Event onset the same day as first dose mRNA-1273. Event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 37-year-old female with serious unexpected events of pharyngeal swelling, lip swelling, mouth swelling, swelling, muscle spasms, hiccups, and nonserious expected events of pain in extremity, erythema, fatigue.

                                                I received the Vaccine on Wednesday 1/6/2021 . Later that evening, my right deltoid was slightly swollen and painful. I would rate the pain 5/10. The next day Thursday 1/7/21, I noticed intermittent heart flutter/palpitations. I had my routine morning coffee and I thought the combination of the vaccine and the coffee might be the caused.  The flutter/palpitations continue to the present. I don&#39;t have shortness of breath. The left deltoid pain and swelling subsided. The flutter is intermittent and last 10 to 15 seconds.

                                                Received Moderna vaccine 1/6/21 at 9:10 am.  Felt fine until approximately 4:00 pm when he noticed his left arm was very sore. At approximately 9:30 pm, the patient became cold with shivering.  Temp fluctuated during night between 99 - 103.8. During the night, he experienced nausea and vomiting, dizziness, body aches, and a weird taste in mouth. On 1/7/21, patient still complained of fever, headache, nausea, and the new symptom of diarrhea.  His neck was now very sore, with pain moving it right or left.  On 1/8/21, slight improvement of symptoms.  On 1/8/21 at 7:00 pm, he noticed a very itchy, red raised rash on torso, arms and legs.  He called his physician and was called in a prescription for steroids.  The pharmacy was closed and he picked the steroids up on the morning of 1/9/21.  He took the steroids on 1/9/21  and has noticed major improvements.  Rash still present, but not itching.  Temp currently 99.1, but all other symptoms improved.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

The right side of my bottom lip started tingling about 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I had no swelling or other impairment at the time and was released after 40 minutes of observation. A little later the entire right side of my face felt as if it had fallen asleep, approximately 1 hour later and it worsened until about 4 hours later. By the next day the nausea and lightheadedness was gone, and the tingling/numbness to the right side of my face was gone within 48 hours, improving after 24 hours.

                                                Nausea, lightheadedness, and finally numbness to right side of face, slight drooping on right corner of mouth and right side of bottom lip. It began with a tingling feeling in lip. Observing staff did not notice any swelling, or other impairments, asked me if I had anxiety, and sent me on my way. Shortly after, it felt as if I had gotten a shot at the dentist, and had the tingling numbness left over on the right side of my face. About 4 hours later, my bottom lip and right side of my mouth drooped slightly, but I could still smile, talk, raise my arm, so there was no other impairment. By the next day the numbness had mostly subsided, and the nausea and lightheadedness was gone. This vaccine was given to me at a work clinic in the administration building. I do not have contact information for them but was provided a packet with this website. I don&#39;t have any pre-existing conditions, do not have anxiety, am not a hypochondriac, did not even know about the Bell&#39;s Palsy issues in trials until after I felt numbness, and the right side of my face felt as if it fell asleep, like a foot falling asleep but it was my face. It was not to the extent of Bell&#39;s palsy, and may have even been my bottom lip swelling slightly on the right side that caused the droop. It infuriates me that this side effect was dismissed as me having anxiety because I was nervous that my face was going numb which would be a natural reaction for anyone.

I began to feel ill. Arm hurt, headache, weight on chest. Body hurt. I went to bed early. I woke up on 13 JAN and felt worse. I stayed in bed until around 1300. I got up and went and sat in my office to work. At around 1700, I went to go get my children from a neighbors yard to bring them for supper. I made it to my back yard before feeling to tired to continue. I went inside and laid down. At around 1900 or 1930, I was putting my kids to bed. I then fainted once more. I don&#39;t know how long I was out each time. I don&#39;t think I hit anything with my head. I got up and went to my bed and texted a Doc.

Fever was treated with a rotation of acetaminophen and ibuprofen with success, however, it never dropped the fever below 99.0.

At around 08:00 pm I started to get really cold and had the worst case of the chills I have ever had. I was shaking so hard my body hurt. At around 10:30 pm I went to bend and started to get a low fever of about 101.4* and could not get warm. I started to get a bad headache and my body hurt. It was so bad I had to call in sick the next day for work. On 01/28/2021 I stayed home and had sever body aches, bad headache, the chills and I felt nauseas. From my left hip to my left knee it felt like I had a bad charley horse. That night I got another low grade fever of about 100.1*. I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and still had a headache. I took some Aleve and went back to sleep. I called in sick again the next day and that day I was a little better only had a headache, a little nauseas and body was only a little sore. I went to bed and am fine today. A note I have never tested positive to COVID-19 and I test weekly.

He received COVID-19 vaccine on 1/13/2021 and immediately developed numbness and tingling in the area of injection which was the left shoulder.  Over the next 15 to 30 minutes numbness and tingling expanded to the left side of his body including face arm and leg and the left side of his trunk.  He began to feel foggy and had some slurred speech.  He presented to the Emergency Room and tests were performed to rule out a stroke.  The patient denies any other symptoms such as fever chills myalgias.  He did not have any weakness of the extremities.  He did not have any speech disturbances or visual disturbances.  This morning on examination he states his symptoms are much better.  He still has some residual numbness in his leg and arm.  Facial numbness is almost all gone.  As of 1/18/2021, residual numbness and tingling is only in his left ring and pinky finger.

My body Temperature measurement (using oral and touch thermometer) started  to increase from 99, 100, 101 to 102 F on multiple different occasions. I was able to eat but with minimal appetite.   Before eating I took Theraflu which contains 650 mg Tylenol it didn&#39;t work well. Until evening I took 2 tabs Tylenol 500 mg , slept for 4 hours,  woke up with sweat, feeling better not very weak and my temperature went down to 99 F.   Took another 2 tabs an hour later and woke up in the morning normal but little bit tired (Day#2).  Monday( Day#3) normal not my usual energy, but better than Day #2.

                                                Almost 12 hours after the second shot was received (no side effects from the 1st shot), at about 8:30 PM I started to feel some mild achiness in my body accompanied by fatigue. As a result I felt the need to go to bed early at about 9:30 PM. At about midnight I woke up with severe chills and intense body aches. I didnt get much sleep but the chills went away before 6:00 AM. The achiness remained but not as intense. I then had a migraine with a lost of appetite and more fatigue most of the day on February 10. Around 4:00 PM on the 10th all the symptoms suddenly started to leave and I began to feel normal.

My skin was warm to the touch, body aches and pain and sniffles, lots of congestion and complete fatigue and severe muscle aches. I had a slight headache also but in the middle of the night 2/3 to 2/4 I woke up drenched from sweat and had to redress because my clothes were soaked.  On 2/4 I had to have the air on because I was so hot but never developed a fever.  On 2/5 I was still fatigue and still couldnt do much.  2/6 I still had arm soreness but felt better overall and by 2/7 all symptoms had subsided.
