                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

                                                Initially, around 1500hrs on Monday, January 4th, roughly 40 minutes after the injection, I developed a scratchy throat, a headache, and nausea.  I got home from work, and having no appetite due to nausea, I fell asleep on the couch around 1800hrs. Severe fatigue had set in. I did not wake up until 0500hrs the next morning to go to work on January 5th. I felt like I had not slept at all, however the scratchy throat had gone away. I worked all day with the nausea and headache. Throughout the day I developed chills, cold sweats, diarrhea, fever, and I felt like my mind was foggy (I had felt feverish since Monday night, but Tuesday was the first time I took my temperature that showed I had a fever.) I went home that night and slept all evening and well into the next morning. On the morning of Wednesday, January 6th, my symptoms had again gotten worse, so I called my primary care physician. He fit me in and tested me for the flu and for COVID. He prescribed me Ibuprofen for the headache/fever, and Ondansetron for the nausea/vomiting. My flu test came back negative on Thursday, January 7th, and my COVID test came back negative on Friday, January 8th. The fever finally broke on Friday evening and Saturday, January 9th  was the first day I woke up without a fever.  I still have the headache as of today, January 11th, and a low grade fever has returned. I am still very fatigued as well.

When she entered his bedroom she observed &#34;the tail end of a Grand Mal seizure.&#34;  RN notes that the mother reported symptoms such as stiffness and flailing which was thought to be consistent with a tonic-clonic seizure. Patient was not incontinent, but did experience a period of confusion following the episode, thought be a post-ictal  period. EMS was summoned at 8:10am and transported the patient to the emergency department for assessment. RN reports that the patient has no previous history of seizure. Symptoms have resolved and RN reports that the patient has had no recurrent symptoms or seizures while in the emergency department.

                                                I woke up at 3 A.M. the following morning with a bad migraine and dry mouth. I was also very nauseous so I went to my kitchen to have a glass of water. On the way back to the bedroom I felt my blood pressure bottom out and lost consciousness briefly and regained consciousness lying on the floor and my wife helping me up. I was able to make it to the bathroom and lay against the toilet because I thought I was going to throw up. I had that same feeling of my blood pressure dropping and again lost consciousness and regained consciousness with my head laying on the toilet seat. I also had sever chills and body aches, particularly in the neck area. I also struggled talking and communicating with my wife. She tells me I wasn?t making sense and my words were slurred.

Rash is blanchable and fully pinpoint-macular, no papules or plaques.   At approx. 36 hours post-vaccine, the rash had spread down both arms and up the neck, sparing the face. The rash gets intensely pruritic when scratched or itched. There is no pain, shortness of breath, altered mental status, or other compromise of the subject&#39;s health or well-being.

                                                On  the morning of 3/3/2021 i felt a slight amount of discomfort in right armpit. The following night, 3/4/2021, muscle pain in upper back started to develop. The morning of 3/5/2021 the muscle pain had spread from upper back to neck and shoulders. The pain was severe enough to impede the ability to get dressed or drive.  I took Ibuprofen and noticed little relief, then took 1g of acetaminophen and experienced some relief. Pain persisted at same degree until the evening of  3/7/2021  where pain had started to noticeably subside. On morning of 3/8/2021,  armpit discomfort had ceased and muscle pain and been reduced to that of very slight soreness.  as on 3/10/2021 all pain had disappeared.

                                                My arm became very sore, to the point of near complete immobility, 4 hrs after injection. The condition has not improved, and it is now 39 hours after injection. Regular, everyday tasks are very difficult. Pain is about a 7.5/10.  Also, 24 hrs after injection I experienced a fever. The fever lasted for 12 hours without coming below 103 degrees, and went up to 105.2 degrees at its highest. This was accompanied by extreme chills. I have also have body aches, which are likely a result of the fever, and the fact that I haven&#39;t slept in 2 nights because of these side effects.

His face was slightly red on one side.  The patient stated he was breathing normally, but wasn&#39;t sure if it was an allergic reaction.  As a precaution I offered 50 mg of diphenhydramine to the patient, and he accepted and took it by mouth.  I offered to call paramedics, patient refused.  I observed the patient for 20 min more, and at the end of the 20 min the patient felt better and went home.

I thought I would have go some adverse affect already so wasn&#39;t worried. When we went to bed at 9 I started getting chills and a fever of 101, 102F. I had my electric matress pad turned up to max and I wasn&#39;t even sweating but, was shaking with cold. The chill faded at 3am ish and now I just have a fever of about 100F

                                                I randomly got hives and its lasted about 2 weeks now. Once the Benadryl runs out then I start to feel an itch and the itch leaded to that whole area red and bumpy. The only thing I have gotten so far is a steroid and Benadryl. only thing that works is the Benadryl.   When I first went into the ER I went because I got hive and ive never had hives before in my life.   I went 3 days later because I had a migraine, felt sick and had trouble swallowing.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Vaccine administered 3/11/21 at public health pop-up clinic. Sore arm from night of vaccine through day 5. Beginning on day two, extreme muscle twitching, spasms, and involuntary movements. This lasted until day 8. Starting on day 3, daily persistent cranial pressure, right eye pressure, and ear pressure. This persists today (day 26). On day 4, heart rate noticeable heart rate increases, palpitations, and chest tightness. This persists today (day 26).   On day 7, I woke up early AM and upon trying to fall back asleep, had what felt like 4-5 seizures before finally falling back to sleep. Upon waking up, right side of body was weak, tingling; right eye vision was blurry and right ear was muffled. Decided to go to ER after 2-3 hours of consistent symptoms. Admitted for observation, routine labs completed, normal. Brain CT w/o contrast, unremarkable. Symptoms persisted into next day, brain MRI WWC performed, unremarkable. ER docs and specialists (neurologist/cardiologist) implied that it could be related to vaccine, as no history of any such symptoms or disease and the temporal association with vaccine administer. Was discharged and told to follow up with PCP, neurologist, cardiologist.   Have since been in and out of doctors appointments(PCP, neurologist, cardiologist), labs drawn weekly, and several follow up imaging/labs. No doctor so far can figure out a clinical problem, but several symptoms persist or worsen as time goes on. As of now, right side weakness/tingling considered RESOLVED. Cranial/ear/eye pressure considered UNRESOLVED. Chest tightness, heart rate increases considered UNRESOLVED.

Provider called for help and this provider &amp;  FNP responded. Patient was awake and looking at us but was not responding to questions. Patient was assisted fully to a wheel chair and moved to a private room. Vitals were obtained - oxygen saturations were low and patient began to look dusky and cyanotic around lips. AGNP, FNP, and Dr also arrived.  Oxygen was applied. Blood pressure was in the 60s systolic and 30&#39;s diastolic.  Patient started to pink up after oxygen was given. Patient&#39;s phone had an active call (girlfriend). She was unable to provide any history for the patient.  Patient started answering questions slowly. EMS arrived and transported patient to Hospital Emergency Dept.

                                                About 2-5 minutes after receiving shot I felt a twitch/bubbling feeling in the left side of my face. I immediately started getting anxiety and my hands began to sweat. I also started getting a mild pain in my lower spine. Which is still persisting today (2 days later). Yesterday I was pretty tire and had aches all day that came and went. It was very hard to work from home but I managed to work 6 hours with breaks. Also yesterday and this morning when I got out of the shower I noticed 2-3 itchy red bumps on my stomach area. I?m not sure if I had a mild allergic reaction to the vaccine. Either way, I will most likely contact my doctor before I get my second dose. I hear the second dose is more intense which makes me hesitant as the first dose debilitated me quite a bit.  I am usually very healthy and have never had any allergic reactions which makes this puzzling. The only thing that comes to mind that may have caused this is mushroom immune supplement. Any info will be much appreciated, thanks.

Treatment: Took the day after the shot off of work and slept a LOT (approx 18 hours on and off), stayed hydrated and fed. Did not take painkillers due to hearing it would interfere with vaccine uptake. Most symptoms except for headache had gone away by 30-hour mark. Only some lingering fatigue and achiness left over past 36-hour mark.

After sitting in the waiting area for roughly 5 minutes it looked like the patient was starting to fall asleep. He slid off of his chair and onto the floor where it looked like he was having mini seizures. He was unconscious for about 30 seconds to one  minute. The paramedics were called.

                                                I received the 2nd vaccine at 1:30pm, by 8:30pm I was extremely fatigued and went to bed early. I woke up in the middle of the night (around 12:00AM) with terrible night sweats, chills, a fever of 101, a terrible headache (completely different from my migraines) and my arm was extremely sore and painful. I tried to avoid taking any medication as I heard that it could decrease the efficacy of the vaccine, but it became unbearable so I took ibuprofen around 3:00am. My symptoms lasted throughout the next day, the fever subsided after the first dose of ibuprofen however I still had chills and the headache. The chills finally subsided around 3:00pm and the headache did not subside until I woke up Friday (2/5/21) morning around 6:00am which was roughly 42 hours after my second dose was administered.

                                                Very brief vasovagal response (syncope) lasting less than 5 seconds.

One week later (Thursday, 3/18/21), sore arm and slight muscle/joint pain came back and has subsided. Friday evening I experienced left jaw and ear pain and has subsided. Saturday morning, small bumps/rash appeared on left forearm (vaccine in left shoulder). Saturday evening, same thing on right forearm. Bumps/rash are similar to blisters and some have pustules. Itchy and painful. Took Benadryl. Sunday morning, more on hands, feet, and ankles. Continued Benadryl and monitoring. Sunday evening, increased density of sites on hands, feet, and ankles. Some showing on lower legs and knees. Monday morning (now), itchiness and pain increased. Increased Benadryl intake. This has helped reduce itchiness slightly. Sites are still painful. Hands feel slightly swollen/tight where sites are.

                                                Around 2:00am of the day of the adverse event i started to feel &#34;off&#34; so i continued to try to go to sleep when i started sweating from my upper body at the same time my heart rate increased fast, at that point it was hard for me to even move my body without making my heart go faster. My girlfriend was treating me during the event helping me taking my shirt off because i got desperate from the heat and cold at the same time i drenched my side of the bed and speaking incoherently at times, i asked my girlfriend to bring me my phone in case &#34;i needed to call 911&#34; but in the process i fell asleep while my girlfriend was watching me until 6:00am i finally slept, since that day i have been feeling better but not 100% i still have some sort of muscle spasms in ramdom areas of my body but more on my left upper arm

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

                                                During the first day after taking vaccine, started having a fever, headache, and sore throat. By the evening, fever was severe and 102&#43;, with severe headache and sore throat. After sleeping on that nigh (had disruption of sleep from 2 - 4 in the morning), it was looking normal., just had usual fatigue after a fever. But on Thursday (Took vaccine on Tuesday morning, March 02, 2021), I suddenly started having a seizure, my whole body was shaking, legs were cramping. I thought it was going to go away, but after 10 minutes it was getting worse and I had to call the emergency services. The fire service members first came, they measured my blood oxygen level, it was 98%, but my blood pressure was high (140). I was still shaking and having the seizure. They tried to calm me down by talking, after some time, my blood pressure came to normal and I started getting normal (no seizure at that point). I declined the ambulance service as it is expensive and I was getting normal. I had a 101 fever just after that and went to visit the health care facilities .

                                                This patient felt fine with the injection and for the 15 min following. He was dismissed to check out and make a follow up appt. While waiting in line to make his appt, he stated to his mother (who had given him a ride and stayed with him) that he felt faint. His mother shouted to staff nearby that he was going to pass out, so a staff person grabbed a chair for him. He sat in the chair, but did not fully lose consciousness. I ran to him with , told someone to get an ice pack, and asked his mother to sit in a chair next to him and place her hand on his right arm. I checked his bp at this time and it was 58/30. He was shaking all over, diaphoretic, pale,  and his muscles were weak.  He asked for water, so one was given to him, and he promptly drank the whole 16 oz bottle.  Over approximately 5 min, he came back to his normal LOC, stopped shaking and sweating, and stated that he was feeling better.  He was given a small bag of crackers and another bottle of water, which he quickly consumed before standing up. At this point, he stated that he was feeling hung over after staying out late the evening before drinking and celebrating St. Patrick&#39;s Day. Instructed him to make sure he is well hydrated before he comes for his second dose vaccination.

                                                Patient received 1st dose of Moderna at approximately 12:30pm on 3/18/21. He did not stay the recommended 15 minutes on site for observation. He drove himself back to vaccination clinic parking lot at approximately 1:40pm and got out of his car hurriedly to get his mask from the trunk before speaking with EMS on site. He then reported to EMS his wife witnessed him have a seizure (eyes rolled back, unresponsive, stiffening of arms and legs) for 2-3 min approximately 1 hour after receiving his shot. He reported when he regained responsiveness he asked his wife what had happened as he reportedly had no recollection of the seizure, they decided to call the patient&#39;s sister and she directed them to return to site of vaccination to report his seizure.  EMS who evaluated patient reported he denied (and was not exhibiting) postictal signs/symptoms when he arrived back in parking lot at vaccination site. He denied having a history of seizures or any medical conditions. EMS also reported that neither the patient nor his wife called 911 after the seizure. Patient declined any further medical evaluation/follow up. EMS urged him to call 911 if he had anymore seizure activity to which he replied he thought if he just rested Friday and through the weekend, he&#39;d be fine to return to work on Monday.

Patient came in today around 1 pm stating he was sore and couldn&#39;t sleep last night and today he has limited movement in left arm. He can lift it up to almost horizontal position forward but difficulty moving it backwards. He took 2 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen as directed and still sore. Advised he can take 4 of the 200 mg Ibuprofen (800 mg) every 8 hours for a day and see if that relieves pain and motion. He can also put a cold compress to affected area for slight swelling. If not better in a day or so advised him to contact a doctor, because might need something stronger to treat reaction to vaccine.

Over the weekend the weakness improved slightly, but has not improved much in the past few days.  I am also still occasionally experiencing the tingling sensation in the same distribution.

                                                Around 11:15 am, Jan 17, 2021, while standing at the toilet, my son either lost his balance or fainted and fell to the floor.  He was able to cushion his fall so that he did not have any broken bones, bleeding etc.  He said he felt weak and tired.  I had to help him up from the floor.  He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

                                                I&#39;ve prior had mild adverse reactions to flu shots where I&#39;d feel slightly ill for a day or so afterwards, but no significant responses to question the initial COVID vaccine. About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

I went to bed at 9:30pm and woke up at 2:00am unable to move my left arm due to severe pain, a pounding headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and minor nasal congestion. I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep the remainder of the night due to the pain. All symptoms persisted the morning and afternoon of the 21st as well. The severe arm pain subsided but I still struggled to lift my arm past 90 degrees without intense pain. I went to bed on the 21st unable to rest on my left shoulder due to the pain and woke up the 22nd with most symptoms gone except for a minor headache and moderate soreness in the left arm.

                                                Chills starting around 10:30 PM, joined shortly after by an increasingly painful headache. Alternating between chills and being overheated on and off all night, while headache became worse. Had to take ibuprofen at 7:30 AM after not being able to sleep, and was able to sleep. Woke up at 1 PM and had to take another ibuprofen for the headache. Chills were gone, but was overheated and sweating for an hour or two. Had to take another ibuprofen at night, but headache wasn&#39;t too much worse. Headaches were gone upon waking up at 9 AM on Sunday.  Experienced lymph node swelling in armpit of arm that got the vaccination. Tried to do pushups, but became too painful. I had also experienced the lymph node swelling after my first vaccination 28 days before my second one. About a week after, and they always felt minorly swollen up until the time of my second vaccination. I didn&#39;t know they were caused by the vaccine until after the second vaccination.  Currently 1:20 AM on Monday, and I have been experiencing redness and itching in a large patch around the vaccination site all day.

Next day I was in bed all day the next day because of the severe body aches. Cough got worse for the next few days or so after that.  I had some shortness of breath because of the coughing. Migraines started - strong headaches. The first one was the morning after the vaccine. During the next day (third day after vaccine) I had another migraine.  Symptoms were acute for three days.

First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

                                                I am the patient&#39;s neurologist. The patient has very well controlled epilepsy without a seizure in over a year. He is compliant with medication and did not have another provoking factor.  Approximately 6 hours after receiving the vaccine he had a generalized seizure, which was witnessed by his wife. He had an aura, behavioral arrest, tonic-clonic activity for 1 minute followed by a post-ictal period of several hours. This is consistent with his known seizures, but the provocation appears to be the vaccine he received earlier in the day.

He notes he was not until approximately 1.75 hours after vaccination that he began to develop a runny nose and aching primarily in his arm.  He felt this might be normal but then soon after developed a hot itchy tight feeling in his throat with ongoing rhinorrhea, mild tightness in breathing and soreness in his left arm. He has had similar reactions with Remicade in the past and they became severe and that is why he is no longer using Remicade.

I have not had covid and have not been sick since pandemic started. The following morning I woke up with a fever of 101 and extreme arm pain. As the morning progressed, I continued to have increasing fever even after taking Tylenol 500mg every 4-6 hours. My fever peaked at 104.7 by 3pm on 1/20, then started to come down after taking 400mg of ibuprofen. By 9pm on 1/20, my fever started to spike again and then I took more inbuprofen. As of 1/21, I am still having symptoms of being unwell and nausea, as well as low grade fever of 101. I do not have any covid symptoms (no cough, no loss of taste).

I would fall asleep for a bit but then at 4am I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was so unbearable that I would clinch my eyes shut. Bones and muscle pains all over. Violent hot/cold flashes. I would feel hot all over and after a minute or so of placing a cold pack on my head I began to shiver despite sweating. Around 5am I was looking at my phone wondering if I should go to the ER because I legitimately felt like I was in danger.  The unbearable headache lasted a total of 14 hours from its onset. No OTC medications were taken.  Around 6pm on day 2 from the dose the intensity of the headache began to subside VERY slowly.  I woke up on day 3 completely fine as if nothing happened.

They begin vomiting and sweating heavily within 30 minutes after the vaccine. They felt very dizzy and were unable to walk from the clinic to their car and had to find a ride home from the facility. They were unable to return to their shift that evening.

                                                Developed a sizable rash in the deltoid which started a little more than 24 hours after the injection. This only occurred after my second dose. The rash was dark red, was warm to the touch, and felt tight. No increased pain or itching. I took a antihistamine the following day and these seemed to help reduce the rash. It was gone after 4 days.

He reports mild swelling under his right eye, as well as to his right cheek area. He also reports that he can?t fully open his right eye, which impairs his field of vision; otherwise, denies any vision changes. Instructed that the symptoms were suggestive of Bell?s Palsy, but to go straight to ER for further evaluation.

                                                At approximately 930 am, Offender was vaccinated in Housing Unit and returned to his bed. He was monitored by nursing staff for 15 minutes and had no adverse reaction or side effects. At approximately 1030am, Offender  was called to the officer&#39;s desk and was told to report to the visiting room for vaccination. Upon arrival, offender  was again vaccinated in the opposite arm. Offender was called in error rather than his room mate was who was an add on to the vaccination list. Offender was admitted to the Health Care Unit for observation for 24 hrs. Vital signs remained stable throughout this period with only a complaint of bilateral sore arms.  There were nono additional sequelae. Office of Health Services was notified of the incident on February 25, 2021 and began a review as part of our quality improvement process and in order to recommend practice modifications, provide education, implement policy change, monitor outcomes and prevent re-occurrence.  OHS reviewed information obtained from Moderna regarding the management of vaccine administration errors.  The error at facility is known as an &#34;invalid dose&#34;.  In general there is limited information, yet low risk, for individuals who either receive a second dose within 21 days or a higher than authorized dose volume. The recommendations in this guidance related to the facility occurrence are summarized:  Second dose administered in &lt; 21 days  Do not repeat dose. Higher than authorized dose volume administered  Do not repeat dose. *  Inform the recipient of the potential for local and systemic adverse.    Additional recommendations from the process:   1. Identity verification.  There were several opportunities for Health Care Staff, Security Staff, and  Guardsmen to confirm the identify of Offender. a. All offenders must wear their ID throughout all steps of the vaccination process.   b. Health Care Staff, Security Staff, andGuardsmen must verify offender identities as needed for their assignments throughout each step the vaccination process c. Health care staff must verify accurate completion of offender vaccination forms and ensure that forms match the offender being vaccinated.  d. Health care and Security staff must identify offenders by offender name and number rather than housing assignment. e. Use of handwritten lists should be minimized.  Other pre-printed available rosters or spreadsheets are preferable 2. Offender completed two sets of consent forms for vaccination.  It is unclear if he did not understand the process, or exactly why he would repeat the vaccination process.   a. Though language did not appear to be an issue, appropriate interpreters should be made available to obtain consents and provide education. b. When necessary consent forms should be provided in the native language spoken by the offender. c. It is unclear why there was no further attempt to confirm that Offender had previously received a vaccination that day, after stating that fact to those present before he received his second dose of vaccine. In the future, if an individual states that he or she has already been vaccinated the process must stop until his or her claims have been verified or shown to be false. 3. Any unplanned changes to the onsite vaccination plan (add-ons, extra dose redistribution, team deployment etc.) must be communicated to all members of the vaccination team.  4. Health care staff alone are responsible for the completion of all consent forms and vaccination documentation.   5. Identify best practices and standardize vaccination add-ons across facilities. Consider: location, addition to master vaccination roster, etc. a. Perhaps add-on vaccinations can be moved to another area for tracking. b. Add-ons should be added to the master vaccination roster.  Additional recommendations: 6. Re-Training on the vaccination protocol for health care, operations and national guard staff.    The above items were completed.

                                                Starting around 1:00 AM I was feeling hot and sweaty, cold sweats and a headache. No fever! at 6am I went to bed the 25th. .  I woke up around the10 am  the 25th.the next day. I had a migraine that wouldn&#39;t go away. I was feeling nauseous and still had a light sensitive headache. I took Migraine medication, and eventually mid afternoon the symptoms went away. Less than 24 hours later I was back to normal. March 4th I was using Gold Bond Ultimate Mens lotion and had an adverse reaction. My hand swelled up, and got red.  I took Benadryl and it went away. March 5th I used Curel lotion and the same thing happened. Did not take Benadryl.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Swelling of the throat occurred between 45 mins and 1 hour after Vaccine. Treated with 1 Benadryl and 1 Claritin near the 45 minute mark. Symptoms improved about 1 hour and 30 minutes after getting the vaccine and were no longer noticeable by 3 PM (approx 3 hours after vaccine). After the throat swelling receded I noticed a little bit of numbness in the tongue and throat for another 1-2 hours (4-5 hours after the vaccine). Swelling of throat was uncomfortable but not severe enough to cause breathing issues. There were also no problems swallowing or speaking.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was fine until after a few minutes.  He started to say he felt lightheaded.  He placed is head between his knees, he started to sweat and I gave him some water at his request.  He sat back and started to get pale and more sweaty, he complained about pain in his arm and neck.  He then began to slightly shake and passed out.  He was awoken very quickly by his wife who was standing in front of him.  We kept talking to him and I checked his pulse and called 911.  After about 30 minutes he was feeling much better and did not need to go to the hospital.  His vitals were strong and he walked out on his own.  I contacted him 3 hours later and he was resting but feeling fine.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine,  I started to feel slight pain in the injection site (my arm) reminiscent of a bruise. An hour later, I started to feel tired and weak, and the soreness in my arm worsened slightly. The pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 3.  45 minutes later, I experienced stiffness in my neck and upper back, though that isn&#39;t unusual for me. I also started to feel nauseous and cold at that time, but the nausea subsided within an hour.  The severity of these symptoms stayed the same the rest of the evening. I went to bed at midnight, and woke the next morning at 8am. My arm where I had received the shot felt much more sore and painful, especially when I move it, and mainly when any pressure is applied to the area. I was woken by pain in my arm when I payed on that side of my body. The pain is now a 4, but a 7 when pressure is applied. It is now 12:30 pm.

                                                The following day I became increasingly fatigued, roughly 30 hours later I took a 2 hour nap. I awoke and had dinner, about 5 minutes after finishing my heartbeat felt &#39;regularly irregular&#39; and was 55 bpm, which is normal for me at rest. I became nauseous, dizzy, full-body tingling, laid on the floor near the toilet for about 20 minutes. My wife reported my lips became purple and I was pale.  I assumed it was hypotension (vasovagal?) of some kind as I&#39;ve had this happen after blood draws in the past. I drank a bunch of water to get my blood pressure up and smelled peppermint oil to decrease nausea. I was okay thereafter, but I slept around 13 hours that night.

                                                Received 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/20. Besides general left arm soreness for 2-3 days following vaccine, I had no other symptoms until Sunday January 3rd, at which time I began to notice increased fatigue, chills, and mild cough. Symptoms did not subside by Monday morning, January 4th, and I called in sick to work and requested that I receive a Covid 19 test from an urgent care. I tested positive for Covid 19 that day, and remained off work until 1/14/21. I experienced moderate chills, moderate increased skin sensitivity, and significant fatigue from 1/3/21 to 1/8/21, sleeping ~16-20 hours per day every day during that time. I began feeling better 1/9/21 and symptoms gradually improved until I was symptom-free on 1/12/21. I returned to work on 1/14/21, &gt;10 days following initial symptoms.

I went to the hospital because I felt I was going to throw up and I had to hold on to my stomach, felt a stabbing sensation to my stomach and the pain was unbearable. They performed an ultrasound of the abdomen and a CT scan of the abdomen. I also had an endoscopy performed after my 2nd vaccine. I had a biopsy of my stomach and I am pending results.

While at work, co-workers noticed I had paralysis in the left side of my face. I was rushed to the emergency room under suspicions that I was having a stroke. The doctor diagnosed me with ?Bells Palsy?. The left side of my face is noticeably paralyzed.

I had a sharp and persistent headache that lasted most of the night. I felt a little pain in my chest, and even when I took deep breaths it never felt like I had enough air. I&#39;m wondering in the breathing difficulties might have been due to heartburn/indigestion. I had to stop taking my heartburn medicine because it&#39;s not good for my kidneys (I also have kidney disease). On rare occasions I have had symptoms from heartburn that feel almost like asthma. The fever-symptoms and chills subsided a few hours later after I took a Tylenol, but I continue to feel fatigued and I have a bad headache.

                                                A few minutes after the vaccine was administered the patient felt hot, lightheaded, dizzy and had to sit down.  While sitting down his eye rolled back and he passed out.  His spouse said his body was shaking.  She lowered him to the floor and he awoke.  Paramedics were called and determined his blood pressure was very low. They tried to stand the patient up to take another blood pressure reading, but the patient had to sit down as he became dizzy and lightheaded again.  The paramedics took him to the ER where the doctor said he was fine and discharged him.

                                                Patient symptoms of chills, headache, and body aches began on Sunday 3/28, 6 days after vaccination.   One day later, on 3/29, patient started experiencing pain in the right armpit, the same shoulder where the vaccine was received.  That pain built up until Wednesday 3/31, when the arm was very swollen, purple, and rapidly loosing sensation.  The patient went to the ER.  In the ER, via ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis of the right subclavian and axillary veins.  From 4/1 to 4/2 the patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure, thrombo lysis, using tPA directed by catheter to the site of the 12 cm long clot.  On 4/2, it was determined that the flow was not restored to the vein, and the radiologist informed the patient that right first rib removal would be necessary.  On 4/9, right first rib resection surgery was performed to alleviate pressure on the subclavian vein.  Patient is currently recovering on the blood thinner Eliquis.  Additional procedures for thrombo ectomy and angioplasty will follow in approximately two weeks to clear the subclavian and axillary veins.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

                                                No reaction post vaccination? I only historically had gotten a total of 4 flu vaccines. 24 hours after Moderna I had b/l dorsal foot tingling that I didn?t really pay any mind to, then by the next day it spread to L hand (4th-5th digit) overt weakness and paresthesias and a cool/numb feeling to my R thumb. Similar symptoms to L 5th toe and R great toe. As days progressed it got more diffuse and extended up to mid-calf that was very mild... eventually by day 10 it dissipated, thank god.  To add I also experienced L facial dull pain and the distal portion of my tounge felt like I burnt it (lasted 5 -7 days)

At about 1030AM I had a very bad headache and was extremely nauseous for about 3 hours and felt like vomiting but did not vomit. This went away at about 1230pm and I felt my tongue get cold and a metallic taste which went away within the hour of onset. The nausea, headache, and metallic taste was gone at about 1-2pm on 1/11/21. I had a sore left arm on the injection site, which is to be expected and went away within 3 days. On 1/18/21 around 1pm, my arm started to feel itchy at the exact site of the injection from 1/11/21, and there is now (1/18/21) a red rash like appearance on that left arm where the Moderna covid vaccine was injected. Possible delayed local allergic reaction.

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

After second shot, I developed the usual thing of arm soreness, fever, chills, joint pain and generalized body aches as well as GI symptoms. All symptoms went away in two days except that I have had persistent symptoms of cramping abdominal pain, on/off nausea, bloating. I still have the symptoms 4 weeks after the shot and nobody knows what is going on.  I lost around 15 lb till now and will be following with my PCP soon to see what is next.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night with a fever, took 400mg of ibuprofen to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I felt mostly normal, so I took my Bupropion dose (150mg) and drank a cup of coffee. I exercised and went to the gym. When I got back I noticed my heart rate while resting was 130. This persisted into the night. I felt tired, weak, unfocused, and cold at night again. It is possible I had a slight fever again. 48 hrs after my second vaccine, I still have a high resting heart rate (90) which goes up to 120 whenever I move. It is as though I am exercising. I feel like I could jump up and run at any moment. I do not feel fatigued today thankfully. The high heart rate with fatigue is what worried me most.

                                                I had a sore arm almost immediately following the shot that slowly got worse throughout the evening. In the morning my arm was very sore. I woke up around 6:30 with a headache and chills. throughout the morning, my headache worsened as did my chills. I felt fatigued and noticed my lungs felt the same as they did when I had COVID. Essentially all my COVID symptoms came back I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I slept most of the morning and then felt nauseous around 3 pm. I vomited around 3:30 and almost felt completely better after that. My headache, chills, and fatigue were still present but significantly less once I vomited. In the morning I woke up with a headache that lasted through the morning the second day after vaccine administration. By the end of the second day, I felt completely fine. My arm soreness was almost completely gone. I also had some aches and chills on the second day in the morning upon waking up but those were gone by mid-day. On day three I feel completely fine.

                                                Approximately two to three minutes after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, my face began feeling flush. I also felt a tingling sensation in my face and neck, and I began sweating profusely. I walked up to one of the rescue/paramedic staffers and told them that I had a &#34;flush&#34; feeling in my face. The paramedic asked me a few questions about how I was feeling, then a second paramedic brought a wheelchair. I sat in the wheelchair and was brought to a separate room. The second paramedic noted that I was covered in sweat. The second paramedic and I decided to remove the top layer of my clothing (a polo shirt) because it was drenched in sweat. After about 10 or 15 minutes of sitting in the wheelchair and focusing on my breathing, the tingling/sweating sensation subsided and I was able to walk back into the observation area. I felt a second &#34;wave&#34; of sweating/tingling come over me a few minutes later, but it was minor compared to the first &#34;wave,&#34; and did not require additional attention from the paramedics. I did not require any medication during this event.

                                                At appox. 1313 a male party with a probable shellfish allergy reported feeling tingling and flush immediately after being vaccinated.   His vaccinator, brought him over to the triage area to be evaluated. Upon RN 1&#39;s initial assessment at 1315 BP 159/85 HR102. Stated that in addition to a shellfish allergy he has a family hx of hypochondria and stated &#34;I&#39;m having a hard time distinguishing between what&#39;s in my head and what is real&#34;   1324 BP 132/83 HR 90 Pt stated that the tingling/swelling feeling was going down but that he did notice what he described as &#34;chest tightness&#34; but thought it was anxiety related. Denies difficulty breathing or rash at injection site.   1339 BP 144/91 HR 84 had another cool wave and chest tightness.

When asked to elaborate he said he was a little dizzy,  was having some difficulty breathing and &#34;rubbery legs&#34; at this point RN 2  discussed with pt that clinic staff feels more comfortable having him evaluated for continued chest tightness and new SOB. Pt agreed to that.     1416 Requested EMS through Deputy.    1424 EMS was on site.  EMS evaluated the patient and decided to transport him to the hospital for further evaluation.  Patient left his car in the lot.  Advised state office of this so it won&#39;t get towed if it&#39;s here over night.

Was given another dose of antihistamines at ER and observed for further reaction. Plans to follow up with allergist to discuss potential for second dose. If he gets another dose of the vaccine he plans to do it at an allergists office.

                                                2 days after receiving my first dose my tongue began to feel tingly and swell, I could feel the tightness in the back and in my lymph nodes as well. I began to have sensitivity to spicy foods on Thursday. On Friday I woke up and my words were slurring as my tongue felt more swollen  and I started to notice some slight swelling in my throat, maybe 5%. I started gargling diphenhydramine on Friday night and that helped a lot, I also took loratadine and Fexofenadine. By Sunday my symptoms were masked by the allergy drugs and I stopped taking the diphenhydramine. 1 week later, 12 days post Moderna Vaccinne I stopped taking the fexofenadine and Loratadine. I continued to have tongue irritation and a sore on my tongue for 2.5 weeks. I then had an adverse event after the 2nd shot as well.

                                                I have not felt the same since I received the vaccine. Initially, I felt tingling in my fingers after receiving the injection. I also got chest and throat tightness. I felt very slightly shaky and just a bit off.  After that subsided a bit, I left the facility and started heading home. Ten miles from the store, I went back as I got another wave of feeling pretty terrible. I waited outside there for another hour until I felt better again. The next few days I had terrible fatigue and constant headaches, and the obvious sore arm. I had a couple days where I was a little better but then it would come surging back again.  For three weeks I&#39;ve had on and off migraines, extreme and dreadful fatigue like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before (feels like I&#39;m dying of cancer or something), and feeling out of it and spacey. It&#39;s been awful and I&#39;m terrified to get the second dose if the first one did all this to me. I was feeling great in the weeks leading up to the vaccine so I am certain that my reaction is to the vaccine. I hope this gets better soon. I&#39;m not sure what to do about dose 2.

                                                I premedicated with Diphenhydramine, fexofenadine and loratadine as suggested by the urgent clinic from my previous adverse event. 10 minutes after the 2nd shot I felt hot flashes in my L glut region, then 15 minutes  in I started to feel tongue swelling and slight throat swelling (maybe 10-20%). I felt this decrease but was still present 25 minutes after the shot, I notified a rep at the nurses tent. They asked some questions and said they could take me into the tent but that if I felt it was improving to just wait 15 more minutes, I did that and left after. I continued to have some tongue swelling the next day and continued taking all 3 antihistamines for maybe 3 days. I previously had sensitivity to spicy foods and my tongue feeling inflamed but not swollen from the previous shot, this again occurred the 2nd time. I maintained this with gradual dissipation of symptoms until about 3/1/21. I believe all my symptoms were resolved at that point.

                                                I recieved my second covid 19 vaccine by moderna.  I still have the subtle altered taste/smell that occured after receiving the first dose a month ago (I have previously reported that).  On 1/25/21, I recieved the 2nd dose of vaccine at 10 am and felt fine all day.  Around 10pm, I started to have chills.  This rapidly evolved to whole body rigors.  My tempature spiked.  I couldn&#39;t move, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would pass out or throw up.  I had to have my wife bring me a makeshift urinal since I couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Went from freezing to boiling, back and forth.  Felt absolutely miserable.  Around 2-3 am broke out into a cold sweat and finally started to feel better.  I was drenched in sweat througout the night.  It was a very long 4-5 hours.  The following night I felt fine although I also was drenched in sweat when I woke up.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

Within seconds I was unresponsive for what appears to have been just over 1 minute. My wife called 911 and I was starting to come to while she was wrapping up the call with the dispatcher. I remained seated upright, did not fall over, but was completely unresponsive.  When the EMT&#39;s checked vitals (within 5 minutes of me coming back to awareness), all was normal. Simply a full body cold sweat. It&#39;s now 10pm and I feel no other symptoms. Completely &#34;normal&#34;.

Finished a conversation at left the facility after approximately 9:55am. While driving back to office (appx 5 minute drive total), experienced clammy skin, sweating at 3 minutes into drive.  I considered pulling over, though I knew I should be around people where I could be monitored, so continued on. Experienced elevated temperature, blurriness of vision and my vision began to turn bright and white.  As I pulled into the parking lot, I thought I may be passing out.  I got out of the vehicle, sat down on the nearest bench and asked two individuals who where outside to stay with me, and I explained my symptoms to them.  I remained seated for approximately 10 minutes, and when I felt the symptoms subside, went into my office and am now filing this report.

                                                Inflammation started on the right and left sides of my neck two days after the shot. The pain was dull and lasted for about two days. The pain then moved to the middle of my back at the spine and blades of my lower back shoulders. The pain has lasted for a little over a week now and has lessened over time but is still noticeable. If I tried to sneeze or inhale deeply, this was difficult due to the discomfort I felt in my back and the sides of my neck.

Second, 7 days after vaccination, itchy and hot area of hives developed around the injection spot and slowly grew  into a 6 inch circle. Third, at the same time with the second symptom, I am having a mild sciatic pain in my right leg.  Symptom 1 has subsided, and symptoms 2 and 3 are still present, but seem to have slowed down.

Also started developing tingling, pins and needles sensations, numbness and weakness in left leg, foot, forearm and hand. Have experienced prolonged periods of time with muscle spasms in left calf sometimes up to 2 days in length.  A combination of all of these symptoms happen daily. Have had muscle fatigue in right arm and neck at different times Have developed a metallic taste in mouth over the last 2 weeks. After the first 5 days developed extreme mental fatigue and grogginess that lasted 7 days and can sometimes reappear.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine first dose. Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, i became dizzy, tachycardic and experiencing hot flashes. Me thinking it was in my head did not say anything i waited the 15 minutes and left the vaccination area. The feeling i got seemed to go away and i thought everything was good and was my way home.  About 30 minutes after injection i began experiencing itching in the face, nausea, dizziness, i was pale as a ghost. Having felt this before it was just like my allergic reaction i get when i ingest shellfish. I stupidly continued on my way home when i should have went to an ER but nonetheless i made it home and took some benedryl about 30 minutes later my symptoms subsided. I also took my blood pressure when i arrived home and was hypotensive. By the next day was fully recovered and no problems since day of injection.

                                                About 45 seconds after injection. A warm cloudy feeling spread over my body from the injection site. Became dizzy, when I sat down I passed out. They estimated about 15-20 minutes. When I came to my body was limp, sweaty, shivering, I had motor functions but could not feel my body. Fingers and toes had a painful pulsating feeling. EMS was called I was placed on oxygen why they took my vitals

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

My temperature  is within the &#34;normal&#34; range, but has stayed at least  1.5 degrees higher than it normally is, and I have been taking my temperature almost everyday, and sometimes 2-3 times.

                                                Around 12 hours after the second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine I experienced the expected severe fever, chills, and rigors.  This eventually subsided to a large extent by hour 30; however at hour 36 I slightly bent over to pick up an item from my nightstand and felt what seemed to be a pulled muscle in my left back.  I immediately went to bed and awoke with severe muscle spasms in that same area.  The muscle spasms continued lying, standing, and sitting.  Nothing relieved them and they were intermittent brought on spontaneously and also by movement.  I could not perform most daily functions and sought medical attention at the local urgent care.  There they diagnosed it as a thoracic myofascial strain.  They prescribed me cyclobenzaprine which helped decrease the frequency but not completely alleviate the spasms.

Discovered hives on my upper arm. 15 minutes later hives had spread to my left shoulder and neck. Paramedics on site gave me a fimotadine tablet and a benedryl injection, juice, water and monitored me. 20 minutes later there was no improvement, they gave another benedryl injection. Dizziness persisted. Hives began to resolve. 40 minutes later they permitted me to leave but said I could not drive, because the dizziness persisted. Advised me to take a benedryl tablet by mouth before bed and again in the morning and to follow up with my PCP.

                                                I had a fast beating heart felt like anxiety as my pulse read regular on my watch. My right side of my face around the cheek, eye, and ear area began to tingle and feel numb around 20 to 30 min. After the shot was administered. It was only on the side of my face that Moderna covid vaccine was given. It ended up going away after 4 hours or so. The next day I had normal reactions to the shot for someone that had covid such as low fever, muscle inflammation, aches, and this brain fog, chills in my sleep.

My shirt was soaked through when i left the clinic. Felt fine and took some benadryl (to sleep) and (tylenol) to stop arm pain and then went to sleep. Woke up at 1am with chills, shaking, chattering teeth and body aches.  Took a hot shower and attempted to go back to sleep, but had intense body aches. Slept a few more hours. Woke up again feeling worse at 7am. fever of 101 degrees. Took more tylenol and more benadryl. Slept until 2pm. Woke up still had fever and body aches. By 530pm body aches stopped and fever went away. By 7pm i felt normal. Injection site soreness lasted for less time on 2nd shot than on first shot.

On the evening of 4/17/21 patient developed right hand numbness and word-finding problems . Patient presented to the emergency department about 40 minutes after symptom onset. After neurology consult, patient was given tPA (administered on 4/17/21@ 2200)  for suspected acute ischemic stroke. Patient&#39;s symptoms initially did not improve, but a couple hours after, patient had resolution of pronator drift and word-finding difficulties.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

I noticed itching at the injection site a little more than 72 hours s/p injection with some minor itching. This progressed over the next 20 - 40 minutes to severe itching with large erythematous rash to the the left axillary region, then shoulder,  and chest. Then hives developed pretty aggressively to majority of body including neck, back, inner thighs, and bilateral legs. The next morning I woke up to severe myalgias feeling like I was hit by a truck with soreness this resolved after roughly 24 hrs. Pain worse in buttocks, quadriceps, and sharp left lower mandible pain.  On 01/02 around 7:30 pm took Hydrocorticone 100 mg PO x 1 and 50 mg of diphenhydramine q4h and the allergic reaction resolved over the next several hours.  Still having upper torso itching going on 3 days after allergic reaction and 6 days after injection. Continued diphenhydramine 25 mg twice daily keeps the itching tolerable.

                                                Slight fever of 100.2, nausea (I did vomit), major body aches, migraine, uncontrollable shaking, soreness at the injection site and lack of sleep (due to the pain in my arm and body aching) all from 1/4 to 1/5 early morning. During the daytime hours of the 1/5, took Tylenol (1,000mg) every 5 hours (or so). Also had nausea (as well as had difficulty wanting to eat because I was nauseous), slight fever of 100, headache (no longer a migraine) and major body aches. Stayed home from work and relaxed on my couch (mostly). Today/currently, on 1/6 at 12:50pm, only symptoms I still have is soreness at injection site (not as sever-more of a discomfort) and slight body ache (not as sever). Last does of Tylenol was taken at 01:30am on 1/6.

Followed by back and neck muscle spasms causing pain at any slight movement. Telemedicine visit to doctor suggested the sore throat was something viral (not Covid), and that it should go away. Two PCR tests were negative for Covid. Muscle pain has not been addressed yet, as I cannot make an appointment until I have been symptom-free for 72 hours.

                                                Muscular pain in left shoulder and arm became very painful 24-36 hours after injection. It was difficult to sleep due to pain. This pain dissipated 48 hours after injection. Pain returned 6 days after injection, on Monday the 8th. Pain was in the lower portion of the left arm and in the calf muscle of left leg. In my opinion, this cannot be explained by any other physical activities.

He recognized that the fullness was worse when he was laying down. By the next morning, the fullness became more of a dizziness, he felt unstable, nauseated, weakness, and intermittent tightness in his chest. His symptoms have been mostly stable until this morning (12MAR2021) he woke with a disturbing feeling of fullness in his nose and sinuses. Then suddenly had a significant flow of blood from his RIGHT nostril. As of this evening he still has congestion in his sinuses, and intermittent tightness in his chest.

                                                Initial side effects (24 hours) soreness in upper arm. Within 36 hours I started getting extreme light headed. Within 3 days I started having pins and needle sensation in my right arm, from my shoulder to my finger, mainly my pinky and ring finger. I progressed to my left arm and right leg.  I&#39;ve had back pain since then but not sure if it&#39;s related. The pins an needles I feel every now and then but not as bad. The light headedness has not gone away, I can&#39;t shake it.  I&#39;ve seen my Dr, he put me on an anxiety medication.  My blood work came out good. I started the anxiety meds and started seeing a Therapist , but I don&#39;t really see a difference, it&#39;s nice to see someone but not getting better. I&#39;m coming off the anxiety med because a side effect is light headedness and that&#39;s not helping me much.  I have not got the second dose and do not plan on getting it.

Entire body was weak and fatigued.  48 hours everything seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.  Roughly 80 hours later from the vaccination, suddenly body cramped up and had trouble speaking and pronouncing words. Fell to the ground and had hand spasms similar to bells palsy or cerebral palsy. Could not speak fluently or get up on my own. After 45 minutes to 1 hour, when paramedics were called and came they sat me up. Within a few minutes, like a switch, I could speak normally again and could walk on my own. Walked out to the ambulance and waited for 15 minutes or so, and everything seemed fine and back to &#39;normal&#39;. Declined to go to hospital, and since that episode things are still &#39;normal&#39;.

He called his mother and told her that he was sick to his stomach with cramps and that he was throwing up blood.  The girlfriend found him on the floor on the 21st dead on the floor in his hotel room at 8:00 AM.  The girlfriend said she had spoken with him around 10:00 PM and that he said he was going to sleep on the floor in the bathroom as he was throwing up and the floor was cool.  She subsequently found out that he was throwing up blood, and autopsy report showed that his stomach was full of blood and further testing is being done to see what has caused the bleeding.

                                                12/30/20 at 7am as soon as I woke up I was in sever pain and had fever and chills.  I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

That got a little better by day three.   On day three my right testicle began hurting intensely.  Like if someone grabbed and yanked on it.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

My wife helped me downstairs and after some water and Tylenol, symptoms reversed themselves in about 15 minutes.  My body temperature was not recognized by the thermometer and then registered 93.4

                                                Persistent (&gt; 4 weeks) right shoulder pain and weakness with certain movement of the arm/shoulder as well as a full pain at rest. This is not a report of the typical soreness after a shot.  Concern for tendonitis/shoulder injury from the shot itself or a complication thereafter.  I have been taking ibuprofen around the clock.  The normal soreness after the shot started around 12 hrs.  These subsequent pain/weakness issues continued on after that point

Treated with Benadryl, water and snack. Remained at clinic x2 hours until symptoms resolved.  Premedicated prior to vaccine with ibuprofen 400mg at 7:30am to avoid  side effects anticipated with the second dose. ?

Then still chills and insomnia. Fever that persisted over the next 36 hours. Responded well to Ibuprofen 400mg for 4.5 hours until symptoms returned. Began alternating with Acetominophen 650mg for better effect. Fever was highest (recorded) at 102.2 F 29 hours after injection. Woke up 40 hours from vaccine after a night of sleep and with reduced fever. Still going up and down a bit off any medication. Last reading 46 hours from vaccine 100.6, but two hours earlier was 99.4. I?ve also had nausea, exhaustion, and tiredness. Also cold symptoms which may be related to the slight cold I had the morning of the vaccination that I didn?t think was anything to worry about - my kid is in daycare and I feel like this for a large part of the winter!

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the moderna Covid vaccine I&#39;ve had a low grade fever and chills.  Three days after the shot, I experienced the worst headache of my life.  I received my shot 6 days ago and I still feel very &#34;hot&#34;/low grade fever and experiencing flushing of the face.  The symptoms haven&#39;t felt serious but I&#39;m hearing approximately 60% of individuals I speak with are experiencing the same or worse symptoms.  I worry that individuals won&#39;t want to receive their 2nd shot due to the reported side effects.  I believe more awareness should be communicated to the general public, so they aren&#39;t caught off guard.   I had a covid test conducted on Friday (negative) and will get another one this week to be certain I do not have covid.

                                                Severe chills with shivering thermogenesis for only ~10 minutes (1 episode only). I was unable to speak for a few minutes due to the uncontrolled muscle contractions and was just generally too uncomfortable to move. It was not a seizure, but it was temporarily debilitating. Once I got myself wrapped in a warm blanket, it only took about 10 minutes to pass (and never returned). The rest of the day I did feel generally ill, but the day after I felt completely back to normal.

We monitored him for over an hour and during that time, he continued to c/o dizziness, frontal headache, photophobia, and worsening when opening his eyes are trying to look straight ahead. We had him isolated in a dim room and had air blowing on him as he complained of being hot. His O2 Sat, pulse , and BP all stayed stable and within normal range. Pt. denied sx of swelling around face/neck or difficulty breathing. RR was stable and unlabored at all times. Pt. refused EMS services and after some time, insisted he needed to get up and leave. Our staff and his co-worker assisted him out of the facility and to a vehicle where we was transported off the premises.  We were informed later through his supervisor that he got worse after leaving and went to the hospital where he &#34;seized.&#34; He is reportedly stable at this time but further information on his condition is unavailable.

The pain in my lower back is serve, I couldn&#39;t really stand up straight. I have had to miss a few days of work. I have talked to a family friend who is a Doctor and he said it should only last for a 1-2.

The day after I received the vaccine I was very tired feeling, my left arm very sore, and I noticed my heart rate was staying higher. At one point at work my heart rate went up to 140 bpm. I went to the doctor after work and was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia. I was prescribed metoprolol for tachycardia. I do not know what caused my heart rate to increase, but the metoprolol has my rate controlled now. I felt the fatigue lasted about 3-4 days and then I was back to normal.

                                                Patient started making a funny face and contorting his mouth.  He said his tongue was swelling. We kept an eye on him for about 20 minutes, he wasnt wanting to eat his lunch.  His face was also flushed which can be an indicator that he doesn&#39;t have enough prednisone on board.  We gave him an additional dose of his morning prednisone dose, 7.5 mg.  The swelling subsided in about 30 minutes, he ate and said he felt much better.  We will double his evening dose and contact his endocrine doc for more instructions.

After the second dose, he also had a fever the first day, developed severe pain in the right arm with swelling and sensation of heat which did not respond to ibuprofen; radiation of pain down to his hand and into his upper chest, all of which persisted for several days, requiring a visit to the emergency department on 2/12/21, where a workup including CBC, chem, CK as well as an x-ray of his shoulder and venous doppler study were negative. His pain and swelling have persisted for over a month although they are starting to gradually improve.

The site itself was extremely red/rashy. The area was around 5-6 inches by 4-5 inches.  It was itchy and hot to the touch compared to surrounding tissue. It was accompanied by slight pain in the arm. Symptoms receded by the 11th day.

I called 911 as soon as he began to lose consciousness and while I was on he phone with 911, he regained consciousness and had color in his face again and felt much better. EMS and the firefighters checked him out and all of his vitals were normal and he could walk upright just fine.

                                                The patient describes a erythematous rash on his left forehead associated with numbness and paresthesias over his left face approximately 25 h after vaccination, that resolved after several hours.  He experienced another episode of numbness/paresthesia the next day lasting for half an hour without a rash. No further symptoms afterwards.  Unknown whether this is due to the vaccine.

                                                Very sore arm, fatigue within hours of the vaccine. Then 6th day (morning) throat swelling and face when waking up and rushing to the emergency room where I was given a steroid and Pepcid to open my airways and was discharged by 9:30 AM ET on 03/10/2021 after throat opened back up and swelling decreased. I was given a script for EPI, Medrol Pack and Pepcid. Upon returning home I had began having hiccups at 8 PM that lasted through Saturday 03/12/2021, where I was admitted to the hospital for a lot of antihistamine rash reactions over my body that continued from the morning of 03/10/2021. Then went to the hospital again on 03/13/2021 and was given a muscle relaxer baclofen around 7 PM to rid the constant hiccups that were concurrent from what seemed to be the steroid used to open my airways. Went home and have had fatigue, but feel mostly better with appetite back. My family doctor saw me on 03/16/2021 and saw that I was still having a reaction on my back and arms with antihistamines and said it was the Moderna shot and I needed to consult with a pharmacist on what to do or the FDA/CDC as he didn&#39;t know enough on it. Now Pharmacy won&#39;t give me my second dose due to the CDC guidelines and they want me in a medical setting to have the second one, if I am allowed - something I am not privy to. I need help and guidance ASAP on what to do.

A shopper alerted our staff and when I came to check on him, he was just rousing but had his eyes closed due to blurred vision. He was able to speak and look directly at me. He said this reaction had never happened to him before. He seemed jittery probably due to the reaction. Asked for water and was able to drink. He said that he most likely hit his head and compressed his finger during the fall but feels okay. We are not sure how long he was out for.

                                                I received the Vaccine on Wednesday 1/6/2021 . Later that evening, my right deltoid was slightly swollen and painful. I would rate the pain 5/10. The next day Thursday 1/7/21, I noticed intermittent heart flutter/palpitations. I had my routine morning coffee and I thought the combination of the vaccine and the coffee might be the caused.  The flutter/palpitations continue to the present. I don&#39;t have shortness of breath. The left deltoid pain and swelling subsided. The flutter is intermittent and last 10 to 15 seconds.

At approximately 9:30 pm, the patient became cold with shivering.  Temp fluctuated during night between 99 - 103.8. During the night, he experienced nausea and vomiting, dizziness, body aches, and a weird taste in mouth. On 1/7/21, patient still complained of fever, headache, nausea, and the new symptom of diarrhea.  His neck was now very sore, with pain moving it right or left.  On 1/8/21, slight improvement of symptoms.  On 1/8/21 at 7:00 pm, he noticed a very itchy, red raised rash on torso, arms and legs.  He called his physician and was called in a prescription for steroids.  The pharmacy was closed and he picked the steroids up on the morning of 1/9/21.  He took the steroids on 1/9/21  and has noticed major improvements.  Rash still present, but not itching.  Temp currently 99.1, but all other symptoms improved.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

The right side of my bottom lip started tingling about 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I had no swelling or other impairment at the time and was released after 40 minutes of observation. A little later the entire right side of my face felt as if it had fallen asleep, approximately 1 hour later and it worsened until about 4 hours later. By the next day the nausea and lightheadedness was gone, and the tingling/numbness to the right side of my face was gone within 48 hours, improving after 24 hours.

                                                Nausea, lightheadedness, and finally numbness to right side of face, slight drooping on right corner of mouth and right side of bottom lip. It began with a tingling feeling in lip. Observing staff did not notice any swelling, or other impairments, asked me if I had anxiety, and sent me on my way. Shortly after, it felt as if I had gotten a shot at the dentist, and had the tingling numbness left over on the right side of my face. About 4 hours later, my bottom lip and right side of my mouth drooped slightly, but I could still smile, talk, raise my arm, so there was no other impairment. By the next day the numbness had mostly subsided, and the nausea and lightheadedness was gone. This vaccine was given to me at a work clinic in the administration building. I do not have contact information for them but was provided a packet with this website. I don&#39;t have any pre-existing conditions, do not have anxiety, am not a hypochondriac, did not even know about the Bell&#39;s Palsy issues in trials until after I felt numbness, and the right side of my face felt as if it fell asleep, like a foot falling asleep but it was my face. It was not to the extent of Bell&#39;s palsy, and may have even been my bottom lip swelling slightly on the right side that caused the droop. It infuriates me that this side effect was dismissed as me having anxiety because I was nervous that my face was going numb which would be a natural reaction for anyone.

The next morning, the hive had reduced, but a new one was seen on the right side of the base of my neck.  Very red and irritated looking but no pain or itching.   There were also 2 or 3 smaller hives a few inches below and to the right of my navel.  This was the only area in which I experienced itchiness.  I have pictures of the last two areas where this occurred.  Hives reduced each day until done.  The last to clear up was the one on my neck.  Total duration, approximately 3 or 4 days.   The areas seemed to line up with parts of the lymphatic system, when I looked up a map of it.

I began to feel ill. Arm hurt, headache, weight on chest. Body hurt. I went to bed early. I woke up on 13 JAN and felt worse. I stayed in bed until around 1300. I got up and went and sat in my office to work. At around 1700, I went to go get my children from a neighbors yard to bring them for supper. I made it to my back yard before feeling to tired to continue. I went inside and laid down. At around 1900 or 1930, I was putting my kids to bed. I then fainted once more. I don&#39;t know how long I was out each time. I don&#39;t think I hit anything with my head. I got up and went to my bed and texted a Doc.

I experienced body aches, fatigue, chills, nausea and vomiting (one episode), and headaches. I did receive a COVID (Rapid and PCR) and Flu test on the following Monday, all of which came back negative. On the 21 and 22 I woke up without a fever, but within approximately 3 hours of waking up my fever would return. Fever was treated with a rotation of acetaminophen and ibuprofen with success, however, it never dropped the fever below 99.0.

                                                Lower Back Spasms just a few hours after vacine was administered.  I went to bed with what I thought was just flu like syptoms like achy muscles.  But this was more then that.  Even laying in bed my back would spasm and almost take my breath away.  That night did not sleep due to the sporadic unpredictable pain when laying in bed.  Describe pain as electic shock or stabbing pain that takes your breath away it&#39;s so intense, but then goes away very quickly.  The next couple of days I was forced to stay immobile due to the pain that was sporadic in nature.  Even when laying down it spasmed.   I could barely walk for a few days.  I started taking NSAIDS to help with the pain and I became more mobile after a few days.  Work has been very difficult and spasms have not gone away even now Im still having problems and am struggling making it through the work day.  I have to lay down flat on my back as soon as I get home from work and take ibuprofen to relieve the pain.  I was absolutely fine healthy and very active person prior to the vaccine.  Just hours after getting vaccine it&#39;s almost like my joints and back were inflamed for some reason.

At around 08:00 pm I started to get really cold and had the worst case of the chills I have ever had. I was shaking so hard my body hurt. At around 10:30 pm I went to bend and started to get a low fever of about 101.4* and could not get warm. I started to get a bad headache and my body hurt. It was so bad I had to call in sick the next day for work. On 01/28/2021 I stayed home and had sever body aches, bad headache, the chills and I felt nauseas. From my left hip to my left knee it felt like I had a bad charley horse. That night I got another low grade fever of about 100.1*. I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and still had a headache. I took some Aleve and went back to sleep. I called in sick again the next day and that day I was a little better only had a headache, a little nauseas and body was only a little sore. I went to bed and am fine today. A note I have never tested positive to COVID-19 and I test weekly.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after my second Moderna vaccine, I experienced the typical body aches, chills, headache, and tiredness expected in someone my age (38).  I was initially happy that my immune system seemed to have a positive response to the second dose.  About 24 hours after my second dose, I developed a severe headache and nerve pain all over the right side of my head.  No over the counter medicine would relieve the pain.  The next day, I developed a rash on my forehead.  The rash quickly spread and consumed the right side of my face and my right eye.  I was seen by medical staff, and received a diagnosis of severe shingles.  I was given Valtrex and, eventually, gabapentin.  My eye continued to get worse and I lost clear vision in my right eye.  I saw an ophthalmologist and was told that the shingles had activated in the eye.  My eye pressure was dangerously high.  I was given steroid drops and drops to relieve eye pressure.     Since February 22, I have battled shingles.  My rash is gone and my eye has cleared.  But, I still suffer from intense nerve pain in my head, forehead, and eye.  All medical professionals opined that the moderna vaccine must have played a role given the timing.  If shingles can be considered a side effect, it is one that has been intense and long-lasting.

Patient was sitting crossed legged on the floor with head down.  Asked patient if he wanted 911 called and patient adamantly declined.  Patient was alert and oriented.  Pharmacy gave patient  a water bottle.  Had patient lie back with feet up.  After a few minutes patient started to feel better.  Had patient stand  up and sat patient in the chair in waiting room.  After going into the exam room for a few minutes to get ready for next patient, I went back into waiting room and patient was sitting on the floor again with legs crossed and head down.  Had patient come back to exam room and lie down on exam table with feet up.  After approx. 10 more minutes, patient was standing up in hallway and stated that he was feeling better and would walk around the store.  Patient left the store without checking back in.  Called patient to follow up at end of shift and patient did not answer.  Left a message letting the patient know we were checking on him.

He was vaccinated IM on left arm. Pt. was educated about post care. Pt. was alert. I moved on to the next two cars and on the third car and about three minutes after his female partener called out for help and said that the Pt. passed out. Thats when the other nurse ran to the car to check on him and told me he was having a seizure. I ran to the lead to explain what happend and to call the medical team right away. The other nure was stablizing the patient. The patient was going in and out of consciousness for about ten seconds. The medical team arrived and took vitals.

                                                On March 24, 2021, the day of the shot, I only felt soreness in my left arm. The next morning, March 25, 2021, I began to feel body aches, chills, and I was in a cold sweat. I took ibuprofen throughout the day to combat the symptoms. The evening of March 25, 2021, the pain was much more severe (body aches all over my body, including my face, teeth, my hands were sore and stiff, etc.). I did not sleep much of the night because the symptoms were very uncomfortable due to the chills and cold sweats. The morning of March 26, 2021, my left armpit began to swell. By the afternoon, my left armpit (the arm where I received the vaccine) was swollen, tender, and soft. There is some redness and the swelling and tenderness are more pervasive. It is difficult to hang my arm at my side due to the pain and swelling. I understand, after calling the nurse hotline, that this is a common side effect but I also have a skin condition (Hidradenitis Supparativa) and it is difficult to know whether flare-ups are triggered by environmental factors.

                                                Patient called me about  4 and a half hours after his immunization. He stated his eyes have become sensitive to light .  He also stated that his bottom lip and chin started to tingle about fifteen minutes after the shot and then went away.  . I recommended that he immediately take a Benadryl tablet and wait a couple of hours I said he can take Benadryl every six hours if he needs to. If his symptoms don&#39;t go away  after two doses of Benadryl  I recommended he go to the Emergency Room and be checked out. Pre -immunization I counselled him  on the normal  run of the mill possible side effects and how to treat them.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 26-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 26-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle) (seriousness criterion medically significant), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement). At the time of the report, SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) was resolving.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications taken by the patient were not provided.  The reporter reported that patient never had any allergic reactions to vaccines or medications before and had no past medical histories for vasovagal reactions. After receiving the vaccine, the patient waited in the pharmacy for 15 minutes - 20 minutes. The patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement. The patient was out of it for 15-30 seconds. The reporter stated that she called 911. The patient came to, his eyes were huge, but he was aware to self and surroundings. The emergency team came, took the patient&#39;s vitals which were stable and stated the patient likely experienced a vasovagal effect from the needle. However, the reporter thinks it was a potential seizure; more than a vasovagal response. Emergency team offered no treatment. The emergency team had encouraged the patient to follow up with a doctor but the patient did not want to make a big scene.  Emergency team offered no treatment for the patient.

                                                Patient is 39-year-old male with no significant past medical history who works at long-term care facility.  He received COVID-19 vaccine on 1/13/2021 and immediately developed numbness and tingling in the area of injection which was the left shoulder.  Over the next 15 to 30 minutes numbness and tingling expanded to the left side of his body including face arm and leg and the left side of his trunk.  He began to feel foggy and had some slurred speech.  He presented to the Emergency Room and tests were performed to rule out a stroke.  The patient denies any other symptoms such as fever chills myalgias.  He did not have any weakness of the extremities.  He did not have any speech disturbances or visual disturbances.  This morning on examination he states his symptoms are much better.  He still has some residual numbness in his leg and arm.  Facial numbness is almost all gone.  As of 1/18/2021, residual numbness and tingling is only in his left ring and pinky finger.

My body Temperature measurement (using oral and touch thermometer) started  to increase from 99, 100, 101 to 102 F on multiple different occasions. I was able to eat but with minimal appetite.   Before eating I took Theraflu which contains 650 mg Tylenol it didn&#39;t work well.

As a result I felt the need to go to bed early at about 9:30 PM. At about midnight I woke up with severe chills and intense body aches. I didnt get much sleep but the chills went away before 6:00 AM. The achiness remained but not as intense. I then had a migraine with a lost of appetite and more fatigue most of the day on February 10. Around 4:00 PM on the 10th all the symptoms suddenly started to leave and I began to feel normal.

My skin was warm to the touch, body aches and pain and sniffles, lots of congestion and complete fatigue and severe muscle aches. I had a slight headache also but in the middle of the night 2/3 to 2/4 I woke up drenched from sweat and had to redress because my clothes were soaked.  On 2/4 I had to have the air on because I was so hot but never developed a fever.  On 2/5 I was still fatigue and still couldnt do much.  2/6 I still had arm soreness but felt better overall and by 2/7 all symptoms had subsided.

Patient felt the numbness was starting to wear off or feeling was starting to come back around 2:40pm when this was reaction was reported to me. His left side now feels like &#34;when you go to surgery and get numbed up and the anesthesia starts to wear off&#34; that is what he feels now.

That was the extent of things for a few hours.   @ 4 hours... randomly while doing absolutely nothing started getting short of breath &#43; breathing through a tube feeling &#43; drastically increased brain fog.   @ 11 hours... splitting headache &#43; arm at the injection site painful to the touch &#43; combination of pain/discomfort kept me awake all night despite my sleep Rx for insomnia.   @ 17-18 hours later... leg muscles were sore and achy and cramping if I stayed in any position for too long. Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

The patient had a medical history of celiac disease and is a kidney patient (other kidney surgically removed). The reporter states that Patient&#39;s concomitant medications are gabapentin and duloxetine hydrochloride for chronic back pain.  On 11 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (unknown lot number) via intamuscular route on left arm for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On 11 Mar 2021, anaphylaxis 3 minutes post receiving the first dose of vaccine the patient developed numbness and his eyes became swollen, then numbness of the tongue, lips and closing of the throat, which all happened at the vaccination site.The attending EMT provided 3 pills of oral 50mg Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and did not apply an EpiPen. Patient&#39;s blood pressure went extremely high (180/111mmHg) instead of dropping. At that moment, it was decided to contact 911. The paramedics placed the patient on a stretcher and loaded him onto the emergency vehicle to be rushed to the hospital. On the way, the patient was given an EpiPen. While in the hospital, the patient was given more diphenhydramine and injected with methylprednisolone. Patient was in observation for 4 hours and then released with a prescription of an EpiPen. It was reported that the patient was extremely sleepy due to the medications given. When the patient arrived home, he went straight to bed. The patient was hospitalized on 11 Mar 2021 for Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Pruritus and released on same day after 4 hours. The next day, Friday (12 Mar 2021) the patient got up around 10:00am. Then at 10:05am, the symptoms began to reoccur with numbness of the lips, tongue, closing of throat and extreme itchiness. As soon as patient&#39;s husband noticed, he did not apply EpiPen and drove the patient to the emergency room. The emergency room followed the same protocol with methyprednisolone steroid, EpiPen and diphenhydramine. On Saturday (13 Mar 2021) and Sunday (14 Mar 2021), the doctor was seen and the patient was advised to take diphenhydramine every 4 hours. Then this past Monday (15 Mar 2021), patient started developing shortness of breath and a resting heart rate of 135bmp. That day, the patient was taken to urgent care.  There he was administered diphenhydramine and the patient&#39;s heart was checked. Urgent care agreed that his heart was acting up and his blood pressure was acting up for an unknown reason. Reporter states that the patient had been developing tachycardia for no reason for a week now. Since the tachycardia had occurred, reporter would check patient&#39;s oxygen (O2) levels. When the tachycardia had started, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation (O2 sat ) would drop as well. O2 levels were reported to be 88% and resting heart rate of 103bmp. The reporter would let 5 minutes pass, recheck, and everything would return to normal. On Monday (22 Mar 2021), patient is scheduled to see a cardiologist who will place the patient on a machine to check his heart rate for 3 days to see what is going on. Follow-up with various health care providers was scheduled for the rest of the week. Nephrologist will be seen on Monday, Neurologist will be seen on Tuesday, and Kaiser will be visited on Wednesday. Reporter stated that even though asked to run bloodwork and images, the emergency room did not do it.  Lab work was performed on Monday (15 Mar 021) which came back normal. A check for blockage of the heart, also had looked fine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Tachycardia, Heart rate increased, and Dyspnoea was unknown.  The outcome of the event Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Tachycardia, Heart rate increased, Dyspnoea, and the patient&#39;s O2 sat would drop as well, O2 levels were reported to be 88% was considered to be unknown at the time of this report.  The treatment medications diphenhydramine, EpiPen injection x 2,  and Methylprednisolone steroid injection x 2 was reported to be taken by the patient.  The events Anaphylactic reaction, Anaphylactic reaction/Anaphylaxis, Hypoaesthesia/Numbness, Eye swelling/Swollen eyes, Hypoaesthesia oral/ Numbness of tongue, Hypoaesthesia oral/ Numbness of lips, Oropharyngeal discomfort/ Closing of throat, Blood pressure increased/Extremely high blood pressure 180/111mmHg, Pruritus/ Extreme itchiness were considered meet seriousness criteria of hospitalization,  life threatening, and medically important..  The events Somnolence/Sleepiness, Pruritus/ Extreme itchiness, Heart rate increased / 35bmp resting heart rate, Dyspnoea/Shortness of Breath, and Tachycardia /Tachycardia were considered medically important.  The causality per reporter was not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 39 Y/O M hospitalized with a serious expected anaphylactic reaction and unexpected BP increased, oropharyngeal discomfort, eye swelling, hypoaesthesia, pruritus, and NS unexpected somnolence, tachycardia, heart rate increased, and dyspnea with O2 saturation decreased. Event onset 3 minutes after first dose mRNA-1273. Based on current available information and temporal association between use of the product and start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded
