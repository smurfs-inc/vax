                                                Injection site pain began about 5 hours after getting vaccine and progressively worsened. Unable to lift arm above shoulder without significant pain at about 12 hours post injection. About 13-14 hours post vaccine, began having myalgias, chills. Took ibuprofen with some improvement of symptoms, but unable to sleep due to the combination of arm pain, chills and aches. Body aches and chills were gone by the morning but the arm pain lingered, less than the night before and improving each day, still there today, but much more tolerable.

                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

I did not thinking anything of it and was reassured I had received the whole dose. One week after receiving vaccine my L arm noted to be very itchy. Upon looking at my arm I noticed a lemon sized red raised hive where I received the vaccine. My arm is still mildly sore and the hive has continued since noticing it. I had not noticed it previous to this.

                                                It was noted during injection a tremendous amount of pain/stinging/burning that lasted a few minutes. About 20 minutes post injection, numbness/tingling noted in pinky/5th finger radiating down palm to wrist on same arm as injection as well as dizziness. Notified observation RNs and moved to a separate room. Mildly elevated BP but normal HR noted. No rash/hives/difficulty breathing. Numbness and tingling would migrate - most often to thumb but sometimes up entire arm. Released 1 hour after injection after no life threatening signs noted.  Visited PCP the next day (1/6) at 10:15. Professional opinion that it is due to swelling from injection - now noticeable area of swelling around injection site. Recommended ice and NSAIDs.

I still feel pain/tenderness today, Saturday, January 9th. The pain is mild/moderate. I am still able to do my day-to-day activities.   (I did not think it was vaccine related, so I did not make note of this during my v-safe daily check in.)

                                                At the time of vaccination, a burning sensation was felt immediately upon injection. The person who injected the vaccine proceeded to flick the plastic tubing of the syringe while it was still in my arm, escalating the burning sensation. I let the tech know about the burning and he claimed it could be a side effect of the medication and that I would be fine. I did not suffer any medication related side effects. Left arm stiffness began about two hours after vaccination and after nearly 3 hours, I was completely unable to move my arm. Loss of shoulder posture, complete arm/hand weakness and extreme arm soreness were reported for nearly 5 days. Numbness from the injection site down to the elbow is intermittent currently. Tingling down from the shoulder joint to the fingers is constant when arm is laterally raised or when overused. The left arm is still having trouble externally/internally rotating/raising above my head, and while lifting heavy objects. I&#39;m in the process of starting physical therapy/occupational therapy to regain normal strength and functioning without the tingling or pain. An audible clicking noise is noted that was not there previously to the injection. I am unable to exercise normally and have been functioning at a decreased work and paperwork pace at my job as a nuclear stress technician. I have also been losing days of time at work due to various doctor&#39;s appointments and diagnostic tests needed to identify the problem.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Dec 2020 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: OU520A/011520A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.     On 23 Dec 2020, within minutes of receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction and was rushed to the emergency room (ER). When transported to the ER she began to experience throat swelling, redness of arms and chest, trouble breathing with lower chest pain shooting into lungs, and numbness with tingling in her right arm. Treatment for the event included epinephrine, steroids, and diphenhydramine.  She was released from the ER on 23 Dec 2020.  On 24 Dec 2020 patient awoke with a headache, fatigue, and generalized itchiness. Treatment for the event included ibuprofen and diphenhydramine.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, anaphylactic reaction, right arm numbness and tingling, were reported as resolved on 23 December 2020. The events of headache, fatigue, and generalized itchiness were considered resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 26-year-old female patient who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot OU520A/011520A), and who experienced the unlisted events of anaphylactic reaction, right arm numbness and tingling, and generalized itchiness, and the listed events of headache and fatigue.  The events were considered to be possibly related to the vaccine due to the temporal relationship with onset on the day of vaccination.

Pt. States she was tested for COVID 3 days prior to vaccine and this was negative. Pt. Says she had been sick for 6-7 days prior to taking vaccine and believes her immune system might of been weak from this.  She received Moderna COVID vaccine at hospital. Her symptoms were more persistent and with more intensity for the first 3-4 days but now the symptoms are more &#34;off and on.&#34;  Her headache is posterior and the dizziness is also &#34;more intermittent than before.&#34; Her headache is rated 4/10 at this time. She has taken OTC NSAIDS without much relief. The &#34;dizziness&#34; seems to occur randomly and is not aggravated by rapid positional changes. She does ingest moderate amounts of caffeine to boost her energy level while at work. She denies visual changes/focal weakness/discoordination/nausea/vomiting/abd pain/shortness of breath/wheezing. Pt. Reports that she has been very concerned about making sure she takes the right measures to help prevent getting COVID infection. She has researched the COVID vaccines, how they are made, and which are &#34;more potent.&#34;

She subsequently needed 3 additional doses of Epi-Pen over the next 24-48 hours. She has been on Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours and Famodine 20mg until present.

Then during the night at 1 a.m. I woke up and the same feeling of numbness was happening in both my left arm and leg. This then shifted to my right side, then just to my hands and feet. During this I was also experiencing the noted Covid vaccine side effects of fever, chills, headache, body ache, weakness, and nausea.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. I have a growing red spot on my arm that itches. It is developing a red ring around it. It is itchy, but doesn&#39;t hurt. It only gets swollen if I itch it and it also gets hot when I itch it. I went and saw my doctor and she prescribed me a topical steroid cream. I have been feeling lightheaded, fatigued and dizzy. That started Thursday January 7.

                                                Two days following administration of vaccine, there was a small, oval shaped redness at injection site about the size of index finger. However, the following day that redness resolved/barely noticeable. Yesterday (1/13/21), I noticed while showering in the morning a huge hard lump on my upper Left arm with circular redness the a little smaller than palm of my hands. The red area grew hotter throughout the day and started to swell. I applied Benadryl gel and took 2 Benadryl 25 mg each in the evening. I tried icing the area as a well. This morning, the hardness and redness are both there. No improvement but it has not worsened either. I tried going to UrgentCare to have it checked out, but was turned away because they didn?t want to be responsible for treating this. I contacted my hospital that gave me this vaccine and they directed me to another clinic, which I may or may not be able to go to because it is a little far from my location. I will continue icing, applying the gel cream, and take a Benadryl   Of note, I had no prior COVID exposure. Following any vaccine, I usually get minor fever/chill (like with Flu shot) which happened with Moderna vaccine as well. But that subsided by the next evening. No fever/chills since then. I also had the commonly reported arm soreness for few days. I have pictures of how the swelling and redness looked like throughout all this as well.

Pain worsened overnight. 36 hours later unable to use arm due to pain and numbness noted in fingertips of left hand.  Went to emergency room, both nurse and doctor assessed area and could see injection site and noted it was inappropriate - not into the deltoid rather into my shoulder joint. Discharged with pain medication. This AM (1/14) left shoulder pain still significant.

On Friday, (1/15) I noticed that the left-side lymph node in neck/collar bone area was swollen. The area felt similarly to that of a cyst. Starting Friday night, I began taking amoxicillin to prevent a bacterial infection. The swelling/cyst like bump on my neck/collarbone has decreased in size, but the vaccination sight has become very red, swollen, and itchy at times.

                                                Noticed on 1/15 that there is still a silver dollar sized swollen lump that&#39;s hot and reddened at the injection site. I wouldn&#39;t be too concerned about such side effects except it is extremely itchy. To this day it is still reddened, swollen, warm and very itchy. In the beginning there was pain, which I took Tylenol for, but it is no longer painful. As stated before, the itching is what concerns me and how inflamed the site gets if I itch it.

I was talking to people that were not there. I felt completely out of control. The only thing that helped was forcing myself to focus on the TV, which was extremely difficult. Symptoms started to die down around 3 AM, but did not go away. I slept for 4 hours.  1/20 8 AM- felt like and still feel like I am not in reality, I feel disassociated with my body (like its not mine), slightly out of control of my thoughts, I see subtle black and white flashing like last night but not as intense, paranoia like last night/not as intense, cant concentrate.

Then on day 4 a dull chest discomfort started again which I have had every since (now on day 8 post vaccine).  When i woke up on day 8 post vaccine I noticed left deltoid swelling and tenderness in the arm that I received the vaccine a week ago. I only had arm swelling for 1-2 days post vaccine and then another onset on day 8 (1/20/21). Also have some left armpit tenderness 3 days ago.

(Didn&#39;t have any arm soreness after day 2). It was a small solid bump that was slightly swollen, red, and occasionally itchy

I became extremely sweaty with chills and my entire left arm (side of injection) became numb and tingly. The episode lasted approximately 20 minutes, and I was symptom-free within an hour. I never fainted or vomited.

When the lady gave me the injection, it felt like she wiggled it around in my arm. The injection itself was surprisingly painful. My arm hurt at first like I was punched in the arm on the first day (much like a flu vaccine). But then it got SIGNIFICANTLY worse the next day. I was in excruciating pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine. I had limited arm mobility and any movement caused agony. I couldn&#39;t sleep from the pain. I wasn&#39;t able to do my normal activities. The pain started to subside after 4 days, but had since started to get worse again. I&#39;m in a constant state of pain. It&#39;s now impacting my mental health. I can move my arm, but not without a lot of pain.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received my first dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 15th. My arm was a little sore that day and the next, but it really wasn&#39;t that bad. Late on Saturday, January 16th I noticed a rash around my neckline/collar bone area that was on both sides, but more prominent on the right. The rash was red with many bumps that were not raised and were not fluid filled or blistering. The next day, Sunday (17th) the rash seemed to worsen but stay localized to that area. Monday morning (18th) I woke up with a tender right armpit indicating to me that I have a swollen lymph node. I noticed later that morning that the rash had spread bilaterally to my biceps and chest. Today is Wednesday the 20th, and while the rash looks slightly better around my neckline, the rash has now spread all over my breasts, abdomen, and a little bit to my hips. The right arm pit continues to be tender today.  I took Benadryl (25 mg) Sunday night (17th) and applied hydrocortisone cream to the rash when it was just along my neckline.

                                                At 0200 approx 10 hours after my vaccine I spiked a fever of 101. I had been taking Tylenol every 6-8 hours in hopes to avoid this. Later that morning I was light headed, fatigued, sore throat, nausea. The fever continued to increase. By 2200 that day my fever was 104.7 and that was with Tylenol on board. I also iced my groins and axillary areas to help cool my body. Today is the second day out from the vaccine and I have recovered from the fevers. My fever early this morning was still 102.5 but has since passed and I am normothermic. I am very fatigued with some chest pains.

Major Arm Pain continued morning of 1/22, with minor fatigue.  Through the morning on 1/22 the fatigue increased and I felt colder than usual. By about 1 PM I had started a mild headache as well, which worsened throughout the afternoon. I took ibuprofen and went to sleep around 4PM ( chills, major headache, and fatigue was at its peak) and awoke around 7PM - at this point the headache and chills had subsided and I felt almost back to normal. Mild pain persists at the side of the injection as of this morning 1/23.

Was itchy the previous day but not as severe. Swelling and redness not going down with  ice pack. The red circle around the vaccine site is about 2 inches. I am monitoring if it gets bigger.

I had the fever for 22 days, it just went away on January 17.  I was tired for the majority of the time, taking  a nap or two during the day.  After the first week I was ok, still tired and had the fever but functioning pretty ok. I reached out to my Dr. office 5-6 days after because I was working with healthcare facility and they said the reaction should not have lasted this long, and advised me to reach out to my physician.  My physician agreed the reaction shouldn&#39;t last that long. I did receive 3 covid swabs, flu swab during this time and they were all negative.  We did several other test, all came back normal or negative and nothing concerning.  Probably about January 11th my Dr.&#39;s  decided it must be the vaccine.  I received my second dose yesterday and got a fever.

                                                I am not sure if the event that happened Sunday was directly related to the vaccine at all since it happened two days later, or if it was just a coincidence, or if the vaccine was just a physical stimulus trigger. I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn&#39;t able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor&#39;s office because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn&#39;t concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird. Again, I do not know if this is directly related to the vaccine, but I wanted to make you aware just in case!

The small red, raised itchy spot had now increased in size and spread throughout my arm and up in my shoulder. My shoulder now hurts when I raise it up or try and pick anything up certain movements. My arm has a weird feeling in my shoulder all the way to my hand sometimes. It feels tingly at times but is not constant. My skin where the reaction happened is now different. It is rough and different to touch.

                                                I was very sore at the site of injection around 6-7 PM. At approximately 1:00 AM, I started experiencing a fever (101.3 F), chills, aches, and some heart palpitations. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen, which helped to reduce the fever and chills.  When I woke up, I was nauseous, had a serious headache, fatigue, minor chills, a fever (101.3 F) and more noticeable heart palpitations (when measured with my smartwatch, it reported bpm of 118-124). I had a virtual consult with a physician who advised me to be seen by urgent care immediately.

                                                Got the vaccine on Feb 17, 2021 at 9am. On Feb 18 at around 8:30-9 pm, left cheek started feeling uncomfortable and a bit swollen. The next morning, swelling was extreme and extremely painful to touch. It was difficult to eat from left side and to laugh and talk. Also, had chills and felt weak.  I scheduled an online appointment with Dr.  he mentioned the condition is called acute pericoronitis and he suggested that vaccine might have increased the immune response to any infection that might have happened underneath the left wisdom teeth which hasn&#39;t come out yet. [Note: Same response had happened when I got my MMR vaccine on Feb. 1, 2021]. He prescribed Amoxicillin 500mg for a week.  As of Feb 22. 11 pm, after taking Amoxicillin and ibuprofen, the swelling has bit reduced but the pain persists.

Lethargy, muscle ache besides my usual rheumatoligcal issues, diarrhea, and lowgrade fever have been the reoccurring symptoms.  Tried icing, did not make a difference

                                                I first started feeling very cold around 5:00 PM that day. Once I went home I went to sleep around 10:30 and work up at 2:30 AM with vomiting and 8/10 epigastric pain that radiated to my back. I went to the hospital. They gave me morphine and Zofran but within 5 minutes of the first dose of morphine, my pain returned even more intense and I still vomited 20 minutes after the Zofran. So they pushed another Morphine and Zofran. Zofran helped at this point but the Morphine did not. At this point they gave my three different oral liquids to help calm down my epigastric region, including mylanta, lidocaine and a third medication. I went home and slept the rest of the day but Wednesday night I got diarrhea and spike a fever of 102.7 around 8PM. Now it&#39;s thursday morning and I still have a 2/10 epigastric pain, physically exhausted and had a fever this morning as well.

Lymph nodes stayed swollen after first dose, got worse after second dose, and have been swollen since.   Swollen lymph nodes in neck, hard to breathe, went to hospital, told it was just the vaccine and to wait it out. Lymph nodes in neck went down in swelling after 2-3 days.  Irregular menstrual cycle, started approximately 2 weeks after first dose. Have had a menstrual cycle for 5 days every 9-12 days since first dose.  Hospitalized for stroke-like symptoms (lost vision, couldn&#39;t form sentences) on 5 Feb 21. Discharged after CT scan and MRI came back fine.

I ended up throwing up around 4 am on Thursday 12/31/20 at work. Then over the weekend I  felt very lethargic, had body aches, and the hot flashes continued. My left arm hurt as expected, but the soreness went up into the left side of my neck as well. Today (1/3/21) is the first day since I got the vaccine where I no longer have a headache and feel basically back to baseline.

                                                I received my vaccine in my right arm around 3:20 pm on 1/5/21. My right arm started getting sore later that evening. The following day, 1/6/21, my arm was very sore and the injection site was tender to touch. I felt feverish and had chills. I also had a headache and felt very fatigued. I took some Advil that morning. I evaluated my arm in the evening and noticed a large red rash streaking down my right arm from the injection site. It measured approximately 3.5 in X 1.5 in. The rash was red, raised, painful, and firmer than my surrounding skin. I took 500 mg of Tylenol before bed. The next morning, 1/7/21, the rash had grown larger. The border of the rash was marked and I took an antihistamine around 7:00 am. At 1:00 pm the rash had grown larger, now measuring approximately 4.25 in X 2.25 in. My lymph nodes in my right armpit were also beginning to get sore. I visited the nurse practitioner at my hospital?s employee health clinic around 1:40 pm and we agreed to monitor my signs and symptoms at that time. The following morning, 1/8/21, the rash was bigger, but my skin was softer and more of a pink color than red. My arm did not hurt as much, though my right armpit was slightly more sore. Today, 1/9/21, my symptoms are much better. I have only slight soreness in my right arm and armpit. My rash has nearly resolved, though it is slightly itchy where the rash was.

Localized numbness, swelling, redness, heat, soreness present. I drew a circle around the redness &amp; the welt. Within 12 hours, the welt had dissipated, but the redness had grown outside the outline. Swelling decreased, but site was firm, hot, red, and more sore.

                                                Starting on 1/12/21 about 24 hours after vaccination, I felt very severe flu-like symptoms.  I had nausea, chills, felt very lethargic and sore to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand at work, and had a pounding headache.  The site where I got the vaccine was also more tender and sore than usual after a vaccination.  I left work early around 3 pm, took 400 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and tried to get as much sleep as I could.  By 6 am on 1/13/21, all these symptoms had gone away, but now I&#39;ve noticed a very swollen lymph node just above my left clavicle.

There was no redness at the time and no other symptoms. About 7 or 8 days after receiving the first dose, the area around the injection site became red and warm and the redness continued to spread over the next day. I will be trying an antihistamine to see if this resolves the redness/warmness, and will see a doctor if it does not resolve over the next day or two. Otherwise, I have no other symptoms and feel fine.

It was tender to the touch but painless otherwise. At approximately 1400, the swelling began to burn without touching, causing discomfort and pain. Moving my arm causes pain at swollen area.

At this time I took Tylenol. With the fever came a head ache. My injection sight is very painful. I did not sleep very well. When I woke up at 7:00AM my fever was 100 degrees. It has stayed at 100 degrees until this point (1:30 PM). My headache became painful enough that I took 2 excedrin that have relieved most of the headache. My symptoms are improving as the day progresses. My injection site is still very painful. With the normal flu vaccine I get yearly I have never had any problems.

While I was driving home around 1:00 pm my left arm started to tingle, I got really hot and a wave of lightheaded/dizziness washed over me and I couldn?t swallow. I pulled over to wait it out and my throat swelling got worse.

About 10 minutes after the shot my arm became hot, then numb, and my fingers went cold. Eventually the whole arm numbness resided and only from my elbow up was still numb. However, the numbness radiated to the front of my right chest and back of my right shoulder. I called the Associate health number as instructed by the pharmacy team who then told me to go to the ER for further evaluation. &#34;

                                                12/29/2020- Received the Moderna Vaccine - no pain or problems until 01/04/2021 01/04/2021- Before bedtime my injection site from the Moderna Vaccine became itchy.  01/05/2020- Woke up to a swollen arm (about 3 times the size of my right arm) and the start of a rash (the size of a softball) Was in significant pain and unable to lift my arm. I called the nurse hotline where I received the vaccine. I was told to go to the ER immediately. The ER doctor informed me that they had been seeing this and that their personal vaccine location swelled up as well but went away a few days later. ER doctor gave me Benadryl cream (I can not ingest Benadryl due to an opposite reaction, I become extremely anxious.) The ER doctor informed me that the Benadryl cream wouldn&#39;t cause the same reaction. I was sent home with the cream and a wrap. Upon arriving home my rash grew exponentially over the following days. The site became hot (even after icing it) It remained itchy and painful.  01/11/2021- Went to primary care doctor. The rash and swelling had decreased although you could still see the ring of the rash. At this point, my hand was becoming numb after doing daily activities including typing. My palm and thumb area started to turn purplish/blueish when I would type for less than 20 seconds. The doctor told me they would start to reach out to other providers and figure out how to best move forward. In the meantime, there wasn&#39;t much to do besides wait and see what happens.  01/13/2021- Woke up throughout the night due to continued pain at the injection site. Called the primary care doctor who wasn&#39;t in the office, waited for a call back from their nurse but due delayed call back and  increased pain and numbness went to urgent care (which is under the same practice as primary care). The urgent care doctor performed tests regarding pinched nerve shoulder (as they believed I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder) and ordered an x-ray. The x-ray showed tissue damage but nothing else. I was not experiencing shoulder pain, although during one of the shoulder tests I found more discomfort in my left should (injection arm) than my right arm. Therefore, the primary care doctor thought I was experiencing a pinched nerve in my shoulder.  01/14/2021 - Primary care doctor called and informed me they had spoken with the infectious disease doctor in the area who informed them that they have been seeing a similar reaction amongst other people. (7 days after inject, swelling and rash) The infectious disease doctor reported they hadn&#39;t seen numbness. The primary care doctor advised me to wait 2 weeks to see how symptoms change before performing additional tests. The primary care doctor also advised me after speaking with the infectious disease doctor to not take the second shot.  01/16/2021- still experiencing issues with daily functioning. Still experiencing numbness in hand and arm. Still experiencing redness around the injection site (although much better still flairs up at moments)   Side note: 01/03/2021 - Went cross country skiing, did fall backwards but did NOT fall on arm.  Also confusion remains if  I was supposed to report this or if the primary care doctor/ER doctor reported this, therefore, urgent care doctor told me to report this reaction.

                                                I am still not certain whether or not this is related to the vaccine, but it is very coincidental so I wanted to reach out just in case. I plan on seeing a physician this week if possible, but I am new to the area and do not have a PCP here so trying to get in to see someone is not very easy, and I do not feel that this is an emergency yet. Since Sunday night when I had the vaccine I am getting soreness in the muscles all over my body and have joint stiffness and pain, mostly legs, arms, and lower back. It is worse when I rest (sitting or laying) for extended periods of time. It relieves somewhat with NSAIDs but on some days it is so painful, stiff, and sore that I have difficulty going up and down stairs, and even walking or rolling over in bed sometimes. The last three days or so I have developed red and purple macules that first began on both of my legs and are now starting on both of my arms as well. Other than feeling fatigued and what I have described already, these are my symptoms. Like I said, I am not sure if it is related to the vaccine or not yet, but it did start the same day with the soreness. It has progressively gotten worse throughout the week and that is why I am now trying to seek help from a PCP. I may also try to reach out to my allergist on Monday when they reopen.

I could not sleep on my arm, had difficulty lifting it over my head, and still experience some tenderness when I rub my upper arm.  I have never experienced this much pain following a vaccination in my entire life.

                                                I took Benadryl before this dose per my allergist. About 3 minutes after the dose I felt a little light headed and dizzy that shortly resolved. About 10 minutes after that, I became light headed and dizzy again along with chest tightness, palpitations and an itchy throat. My heart rate was in the 110s. My symptoms would be on and off. I received more Benadryl in the ED with no resolution. I then was given an epi pen and prednisone. After this the itchy throat and light headedness resolved. I was observed in the ED for a total of 4 hours. I was discharged with 4 days of prednisone and 2 days of Benadryl.

                                                Starting the evening of the day I took the vaccine, I developed arthritic pains in my knees and hips. This pain has since became fairly severe - making it hard to go up and down stairs and even roll over in bed - involving knees, ankles, hips, wrists, and shoulders now. The only thing that helps the arthralgias is ibuprofen - it makes my symptoms resolve probably 75% of the way but they return as soon as the 8hrs is up on the ibuprofen. Three days after the vaccine (the 13th), I developed an erythematous macular rash on bilateral thighs. It has since moved to my lower legs and there are a few spots on my forearms. The older macules on my thighs are now a purple-ish hue, but the lower leg ones are very much erythematous and warm. I have also been have intermittent lower extremity edema for the last week. Tylenol, benadryl, and zyrtec did not help any symptoms.

By about 2pm I had body aches and a small fever. The second day, I was headachy with a sore arm.   the third day, Sunday, my arm was no longer sore, but my armpit hurt to move. At first it felt like a bra poke, but it would not go away. Monday and Tuesday, the irritant was high, but not painful. I believe this to be from a swollen lymph node. It currently feels like someone left a marble under my armpit.

At 3am, I woke up with fever, chills, a migraine, dizziness and lightheadedness that prevented me from walking without assistance. I began feeling pain while breathing and was very weak when standing. My fever reached 102.9 while taking Tylenol. The body aches and Migraine were a 10/10. I went to hospital where they treated my migraine and the benedryl seemed to ease much of my pain and dizziness related to the vaccine. I was told I was having a vaccine reaction.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   In addition to arm soreness and headache (which I also experienced following my first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine), I have a raised, firm, very warm, and  red area around the injection site (4inches in diameter). Though the red area is not exactly a circle, the diameter of the red area has steadily increased over the past few days. The area is not itchy. My arm is most painful when I move it (attempting to abduct at the shoulder feels impossible) and I cannot apply pressure (leaning or laying on that arm is also tremendously painful, as is the weight of a blanket touching the arm).    My arm soreness after the first dose I received resolved after 5-6 days. My arm was firm and warm around the injection site for that dose, but did not have this red area surrounding the injection site.

                                                I had t sit in the room for observation for 1/2 an hour no symptoms. returned to work and no problems. Then about 3 hours after I received the vaccine I started having nausea and some hand tingling on and odd. The biggest limiting symptom was the excruciating shoulder pain on the left arm, no relief with ibuprofen, Tylenol, ice, changing position nothing. Worse pain I had in my life. I could not move my arm on its own at all and it was excruciating pain. Went to the ER and they gave me IV fluids and tramadol. The pain was better after that but I still could not move the arm and the pain was still present. They made me follow up with my PCP. I saw my PCP on a Tuesday after being on and off the phone with them on a Mondays.  Symptoms have improved but not back to normal.

I have not felt any major symptoms or side effects aside from pain at the injection site. This afternoon I noticed how sore my arm was and started looking up potential side effects of the vaccine to see how long I should expect pain. I was trying to practice lifting my sore arm and then started feeling light headed. My vision went blurry, my hearing was muffled, and I started to feel like I was going to faint and/or vomit. I tried drinking water to see if that would help and when it didn&#39;t I called over to my coworker to tell her I felt like I was going to pass out. She informed our boss, who called Employee Health. They both walked me downstairs to Employee Health.&#34;

No big deal . Well Thursday morning I woke up with a rash on both of my legs and my legs swollen like tree trunks. It?s a petechial rash. I called the pharmacist told to take Benadryl and Zyrtec since Friday. So I went to the doctors last night since I still have this rash and it hasn?t gotten any better with Benadryl and Zyrtec.  I got blood work done today. And I have  to get an arterial and venous Doppler done on Wednesday next week. They are concerned I may have blood clots since my legs are so swollen with a petechial rash. They are also giving me steroid tapper.

On 1/3/2021 my armpit became very swollen and painful, on 1/4/2021 the Right arm where I received the injection became severely painful, dull throbbing ache from shoulder down to my fingers. On 1/5/2021 my Right arm was now swollen, hot to the touch and a small red circle was forming on my bicep and pain continued to worsen. Today 1/6/2021 I saw my primary care physician that confirmed there is swollen lymph nodes in the arm pit and swelling at the site. The redness of the spot increased in size from the size of a dime to now the size of a half dollar.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Beginning at hr 18 from vaccine administration, I woke up with body aches and fatigue, but not severe enough where I couldn?t work. By hours 40-48, I was still having body aches and fatigue but more severe. In addition, I had light headedness, flushed face, and a ?scratchy? throat (not necessarily sore but felt a little different). I left work and went to urgent care to get tested for Covid-19.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Dose 1  One hour after receiving injection- light headed, dizzy, trembling, hot flashes, extreme nausea, confusion, hard time speaking, skin numbness and tingling at injection site and on face/neck/arms. Took Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Acute symptoms dissipated after a couple hours. Continued to feel dizzy when standing/walking. Confusion/short term memory loss of entire afternoon evening (told by others- can?t remember actions, repeating myself and not remembering, can?t remember conversations). About two hours after injection, extreme muscle pain in left arm. Couldn?t lift or move arm and hurt even when not moving, took 440mg naproxen. Brought pain down to a more normal feeling of post shot soreness.

Heart rate was checked by medical professional in household and was found to be 120 and irregular. This lasted approximately 2 minutes. At this time also felt shortness of breath which lasted 30 minutes. Once the tachycardia and shortness of breath ended, I was getting chills and continued to have nausea and extreme fatigue. Since the vaccination my arm has continued to be very sore. When I woke up on 1/8/2021 I am still very fatigued and still have a sore arm.

                                                Hours after shot I noticed a large red swollen lump. On 12/31/2020 I showed this to one of my providers and he told me to give him a call if it had not disappeared by 1/4/2021. The redness was slightly better on 1/4 but then became drastically worse on 1/5/2021. I had a low grade fever(100.7), spreading redness, pain, itching, and swelling of left arm, on 1/5/2021 and was told to go to urgent care. I went to urgent care on 1/6/2021 and was diagnosed with cellulitis. My injection site was measured and I was instructed to go to the hospital if after given first and second dose of antibiotic, symptoms did not improve. Redness began to decrease and I did not go to the hospital. As of today, 1/9/2021 my left arm is mildly red and swollen.

It was slightly itchy, but I put some cortisone cream on it, kept an ice pack on it and went on with my day. 1/10/2021 during the evening I noticed my arm really warm and the rash had then raised to a more hive/welt like look to it. Still not too itchy but still concerning. On 1/11/2021 It was still red and swollen so I had a PA-C that works near my office take a look at it and they said I should report it accordingly to be safe.

                                                12/31 I had tingling in my throat and was observed in urgent care for two hours with no intervention. It went away by the time I went to bed that night. 1/8 I woke up with a sore arm, did not think much of it and went to work. It was sore all day and when I got home I undressed to take a shower and noticed that it was red, swollen and hot to the touch. I tried hot compresses as I suspected it was cellulitis and marked the borders. It had grown in size the nest morning (1/9) which is when I went back to urgent care and was prescribed 3 days of Keflex. The first dose reduced the swelling and pain in my arm, but by the end of the course of antibiotics it was still red 1/13 I went back to urgent care to be seen for the redness and tenderness. The NP suspected that it may be an immune reaction rather than cellulitis and gave me a single oral dose of decadron with instructions to follow up in 3-4 hours by sending in a picture, and if it did not get better to fill a longer prescription for Keflex. At this point I have taken the prescription to the pharmacy and am waiting until after work to pick it up and begin the script.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning her co-worker, a 28 year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced anaphylaxis reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Dec 2020, within five minutes of vaccine administration, the patient experienced anaphylaxis reaction. The patient had symptoms of throat tightness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and increased heart rate. Treatment for the event included an epinephrine pen  On 29 Dec 2020, the nurse reported that the patient was still having some of the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and weakness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, anaphylaxis reaction, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the event, anaphylaxis reaction, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred apparently 5 min after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# unknown) vaccine administration. She was treated with epinephrine pen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Spot was very hot, itchy and painful and patient advised had muscle/join aches in legs and a migraine. Went to patient first and was diagnosed with cellulitis of the injection site.

After a couple hours, the pain became unbearable, and she had an ED physician look at her arm. She had limited use of her arm on Monday 1/11 and Tuesday 1/12. Wednesday 1/13 her arm started to feel better and she could lift it. She went to her PCP and he said the injection site looked higher than it should have been. Today 1/14 she still has sharp pain with movement and limited range of motion.

No unusual symptoms noted in the first 6 days following the first dose, aside from minor pain normally associated with vaccine injections. On day 7 (1/12),  I noticed a red, slightly inflamed circle expanding out from the injection site to about 2 inches diameter.  The site was was slightly painful and hot to the touch (almost like a moderate sunburn), and grew about a half-inch over day 8 (1/13) before starting to dissipate on 1/14/2021. No other associated symptoms.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:40 am on January 8th, 2021. My arm was a little sore that night, but nothing too bad. I took some ibuprofen before I went to bed (400mg, I think). I felt fine the morning of January 9th; I went and bought some groceries and then took a walk in the neighborhood. I did get pretty chilled while walking since it was so cold. When I got back to my apartment around 2:00 I took a nap, then took a very hot shower trying to get warm again. Around 3:00 pm my arm started to become noticeably more sore so I took ibuprofen (600mg). Between 3:15 pm and 3:30 pm I suddenly started to feel warm and nauseous. I felt light-headed and while I was upright (standing or moving around) I would get some black spots in my vision. I went and lay down around 4:00 pm. I stayed in bed that whole evening with a fever (at its highest, 102), I was pretty nauseous, my arm hurt to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it and my wrist and hand felt very weak. I took some more ibuprofen (maybe another 600mg?) sometime after 8:00pm. The next day, Sunday January 10th, I mostly stayed in bed and ran a light fever (99.9) and was very fatigued. Arm was very sore and I had limited use of it until the latter part of the day. Monday, January 11th, I felt mostly fine, I could use my arm with no issue, but I stayed home from work due to the fatigue. By Tuesday I was fairly normal, just tired.

Starting 1/21 the site started to itch, &amp; kept getting worse. I noticed morning of 1/22 it was welted, all red, bumpy &amp; warm to touch. I notified the lady who gave it to me &amp; she said I could be having an Immune reaction to it. Advised to take an allergy pill. Ended up around 1130a taking 1 Zyrtec. Welting went down, now its almost like a spotty rash, still warm to touch.

The next day I felt moderate pain, swelling and firmness at the injection site. I was also lethargic and mentally depressed; however, the pain in my left wrist ceased. The third day I had no pain in my wrist or arm, but the muscle around the injection site felt firm and swollen. This is the 7th day and I still have firmness/ swelling at the injection site and experience itchiness.

                                                Very painful in the area where I got the shot. I usually have a little pain at the site of the injection but this was WAY worse which resulted in me icing the area and taking Ibuprofen. I also could not apply any pressure on the site so I had to make sure I only slept on my right side overnight. The intensity of the pain was MUCH better the next day, and today (2 days later) it is very bearable.  I also experienced lethargy the first evening after receiving the vaccine, but that went away the next day.  On the second evening since receiving the vaccine, I started to experience body chills and some minor body aches. I felt a sense of general malaise that I often experience when sick.

The patient&#39;s medical history included anxiety and allergy to latex. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 12-Jan-2021, 15 minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received one of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (026L20A) intramuscularly in an unknown injection site for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   12-Jan-2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced a severe allergic reaction which made her face puffy, red, and covered with hives.  She took 50 mg of diphenhydramine.  She was also having trouble pronouncing words because her tongue was swelling and she couldn&#39;t swallow water, so she used epinephrine  and go to the emergency room.  On 14 Jan 2021 she felt weak and tired.   On 13 Jan 2021follow up information was received and per source document/call -  In addition one day later, on 13Jan2021 around 5:30 pm, patient reported that she went to the bathroom and noticed that her &#34;face was still red&#34; and &#34;swollen&#34; and had a &#34;little bit of difficulty swallowing&#34; and took another unknown dose of Benadryl and felt better.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events,severe allergic reaction, difficulty swallowing, face was still red, swollen and felt weak and tired was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female with medical history of anxiety and allergy to latex who experienced serious medically significant unlisted event of severe allergic reaction described as her face puffy, red, covered with hives, tongue swelling and difficulty swallowing within 15 minutes after the first dose of the study medication administration (LOT:026L20A). Patient also experienced additional reported events of non-serious listed events of &#34;face was still red&#34; and &#34;feeling tired&#34; and non-serious unlisted events of &#34;face swollen&#34;, had a &#34;little bit of difficulty swallowing&#34;, and &#34;feeling weak&#34;. Patient was treated for the severe allergic reaction with initially Benadryl 50 mg and then with epinephrine pen and was sent to ER. Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the event of severe allergic reaction is possibly related to vaccine. Additional reported events of non-serious listed events of &#34;face was still red&#34; and &#34;feeling tired&#34; and non-serious unlisted events of &#34;face swollen&#34;, had a &#34;little bit of difficulty swallowing&#34; and &#34;feeling weak&#34; are possibly related to vaccine.

The rash persisted for 3-4 days before disappearing.  The rash reappeared immediately after the administration of the 2nd dose of the vaccine. I became flushed and dizzy during observation and was kept for a longer observation period. My vitals were normal and I was cleared by a nurse after drinking some water and apple juice. The rash has persisted and is about 4 inches in diameter at this time and remains painful and swollen.

                                                I had arm soreness the day of the vaccine (2/11/21). The following day I noticed an erythematous round lesion that was very tender and when palpated felt like a lump. The pain went away 2-3 days after the vaccine and the erythema/lump went away on 2/21/21. On 2/19/21 my left internal arm felt sore. I thought I pulled a muscle perhaps. On 2/21/21 the arm pain was worse and didn&#39;t feel like typical soreness that would come from exercise or sleeping in the wrong position. It was painful when I pulled my arm close to my body, as if something were being compressed. I palpated in the armpit and found a large lump slightly smaller than a golf ball. It was extremely tender and sent me into a panic. Someone pointed out it was the same arm as my vaccination, so I looked it up and learned about this side effect. Today (2/22/21), the pain is gone and the lump is smaller (feel like a typical enlarged lymph node).

But yesterday evening on day 3, I just started to have my upper left arm burn, swell, itch, and turn red. I looked it up online and it turns out I have &#34;COVID&#34; arm which is a rare adverse side effect of the vaccination. It said it would subside in 24 hours to a week. This was not listed on any of the forms I got as a possible side effect so I thought I should report it.

Arm was sore but nothing compared to joints (especially hips). Temperature was only slight at 98.7. Headache and body aches, joint pain were severe enough that I was forced to rest and unable to continue daily activities. Ache symptoms quickly dissipated after 48 hours, but a 2 inch diameter welt appeared, slightly raised and itching mildly like a mosquito bite. Welt is still present now, 5 days post-injection.

                                                This is my second pregnancy and at the time of my vaccination, I was 32 weeks 6 days gestation with an estimated delivery date of 2/15/21.  I tolerated the vaccine well initially with only a very minor sore arm the day after the vaccine. On 12/31/2020 (4 days after vaccination), I felt muscle fatigue around my hips and buttocks as well as significant fatigue. It seemed to improve over the course of the day and was not very noticeable for the next few days. On 1/4/21 (8 days after vaccination), my muscle fatigue in my hips, buttocks, thighs, and hamstrings bilaterally became very significant, preventing me from doing some activities that I had planned. I also had generalized fatigue. On 1/5/21, I had similar symptoms, but the muscle fatigue also began to include my shoulders bilaterally. 1/6/21, the muscle fatigue also included my neck and I was physically exhausted. 1/7/21 I started to note some improvement, and I also saw my OB who did bloodwork but also did suspect a possibly delayed reaction to my vaccine. Today (1/9/21) I am still experiencing muscle fatigue, but it does seem to be improved from several days ago.

                                                Five days after vaccine dose I started with axillary swelling on left side. Then I started having progressive redness, swelling and itching at injection site. By day 8 (after vaccine) I had a 4x4? hard lump at injection site spreading from my deltoid to my elbow. Numbness and tingling in hand. Swollen, palpable lymph nodes in left armpit. Treated with Keflex and Zyrtec. Symptoms improved after 2 days on antibiotics and resolved after 7 days with the exception of tenderness and soreness which is ongoing. There was question if the vaccine was given too low and how much was in deltoid.

                                                Following the administration of the 1st dose I felt soreness on my arm. 2 hours later felt a sore throat, body aches, headache, fatigue set in.  No  skin reaction as of yet. The sore throat, body aches, and headaches resolved in 24 hrs.  The sore arm and fatigue persisted. 4 days after receiving the shot (1/4/21) I woke up to an itch on my right arm in the exact location where I received the vaccine. The itch persisted and grew over the following days. I also felt fatigue, soreness in my right side of my body and poor appetite throughout the week. The redness and swelling set in 1/7/21 a few days after first noticing the itch.  1/8/21 was the peak with the redness, swelling and itching being at its height. I spoke with my PCP on 1/8/21 who suggested I used an over the counter allergy medicine to treat the swelling. I took Claritin. The fatigue, soreness in my right side of my body and poor appetite continued until 1/10/21 when I began to feel more ok. The swelling, redness and itching is slowly resolving. Today 1/12 the area is not swollen, redness is very minimal and itching minimal as well.

On 1/7/2021 I started to feel short of breath and run down. Sinus infection symptoms. I was sent home from work to get a COVID swab. That evening I lost my taste and began to feel achey. Negative test on 1/10/21. Saw urgent care on 1/9/21 for Covid swab and visit. He diagnosed viral and was sure I was positive. On 1/11/21 my energy returned and I wasn?t achey. Congestion and cough. By 1/13/21 felt fine other than lingering wet cough. This morning, 1/14/21 I noticed my arm itched and looked at it and I?ve got a small red rash around the injection sight and tenderness on palpation.

                                                After vaccine was administered, 4:40 pm, I was feeling my heart palpitating fast like an anxiety attack. I also experienced a headache, fatigue, body ache and arm pain that same day at 4:58 pm, and around 6:15 pm I my whole body was itchy. The next day January 12, 2021, I woke up with a fever of 100.2, still with body ache, headache, but no longer body itchiness. Yesterday January 14, 2021 and today January 15, 2021 still having headache, body ache pain did decrease.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine on 01/06/2021. Normal pain at the injection site occured with little concern. Pain in armpit began 01/08/2021. I did not think anything of it, believing the pain to be from an ingrown hair caused by shaving or just something with the vaccine. I ignored it to spend time with family. On 01/12/2021 I noticed the pain had not subsided and deepened into the armpit causing pain to radiate from the area when lifting or moving heavy items.  I palpated the area and felt a pea sized lump. It moved freely. I could not locate it again. I continued to palpate into the top of my shoulder and discovered a large lump in the clavicle area. It is painful to apply pressure. I knew these areas to be part of the lymphatic system. I also did research on side effects of the Moderna vaccine but observed most people to have lymph node symptoms for only 24-48 hours within three days of receiving the vaccine then they subside.  I made an appointment that same day, 01/12/2021, with Dr. at clinic to be examined. At first, Dr was dismissive of my symptoms. Dr did physically examine my areas of complaint and scheduled an ultrasound for 01/15/2021 at  Hospital. On 01/13/2021 I noticed the injection site began to ache again. On 01/14/2021 I awoke from a nap at 6pm. I began showering for work when I felt a burning, itchy sensation on my inner left bicep. I observed two red spots on my inner left bicep close to my armpit with a red rash below the two red spots. I palpated the red spots to find a large and slightly smaller lump under the skin corresponding with the red spots. The rash itches. As of 01/15/2021, the ultrasound had to be rescheduled by the hospital as their ultrasound technician cannot make it into work because of a blizzard. I now have two lumps in the clavicle area that alternate swelling and reducing in size. I&#39;ve been taking tylenol every four hours when I&#39;m awake to control the pain. The ones in my clavicle now cause tension in the left side of my neck. I&#39;ve also applied warm compresses on the affected sites. It helps lessen the swelling for a bit but does come back.

No rotation. It started a few hours after receiving the vaccine. By 5pm it was at it&#39;s sorest and locked in position . Not warm to touch. Just painful.  This lasted a total of 3 days until all soreness and full normal movements without discomfort could resume.

The weekend after vaccination: She started having bilateral hand, shoulder, and wrist joint pain and it has persisted until today. It has continued to worsen. She has taken Motrin, Tylenol, and Glucosamine. The Glucosamine worked the best in treating the joint pain for a week or so, but the pains have since come back and are worse. It is not only in her joints, but also muscular pain now. The Motrin and Tylenol help make it less painful, but do not relieve the pain.

This continued 3 more times in the am, at times having incontinence. (This has never occurred before.) By 10 am, those symptoms had stopped. Only residual side effects were a headache and sore arm. On 12/31, it was noticed that I had hives on my abdomen and back. They were not itchy and I am unsure how long they had been there for; referred to allergy

                                                On day 5 after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I woke up in the morning to feeling pain on my left armpit where the lymph nodes are located. The pain feels tender and constant. It helps to take tylenol to decrease the pain.   My left armpit feels tender and sore. It looks a bit swollen. I know I slept on my left arm, so it may be sore from that, but it does not feel like arm strain. It is just on my armpit area I feel the pain and discomfort. I do not feel pain on my injection site.  It is now day two that I am experiencing this pain. I do not feel pain on my right arm or armpit.

I also experienced moderate fatigue and weakness, constant headache, and loss of smell and I&#39;m still experiencing these symptoms.

Redness continues to dissipate but still present in faint bullseye shape.

Dizziness and severe nausea started and blood pressure decreased. Trouble concentrating and tingling in hands and feet. I was taken to the Emergency Room and hooked up to an IV and Heart Monitoring. I was given IV Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid, and Zofran. I was going to get an injection of Epinephrine but my heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly after the first batch of IV meds and they were concerned that the Epinephrine may have made things worse. I was monitored for 4 hours and then discharged with instructions to take Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours for 5 days, Prednisone 60mg every day for 5 days, Pepcid 40mg twice a day for 5 days and given a prescription for an Epi-Pen. I remained very nauseous and dizzy foe the next 48 hours. My injection site became swollen, red, and tender 48 hours after my injection and then re-flared up 11 days after my injection on 01/17/21.

When I got to work, I looked at my arm and it was very swollen, red, warm, firm, and itchy. By Sunday 1/17, I started to see progress with the swelling, warmth and redness.  It is still mildly itchy. Please note, when I got the vaccine on 1/06/21, I had the normal side effects of arm soreness, fatigue, mild muscle aches and a mild headache; all of these symptoms were gone by Friday 1/08/21. I saw [vaccine administrator] and she instructed me to use ice and hydrocortisone cream.  I iced it for 4 days and there was no change until day 4 (Sunday). I also used Aleve during this time as well. I saw my PCP on Monday 1/18 and she told me to continue the current treatment of ice and Alieve and to update her on Wednesday 1/20.&#34;

                                                The evening of Friday January 29th my face began to experience itching and burning as well as hive like bumps. I did not take anything for that at the time. I woke up the next morning with my face extremely sensitive with red splotches and it was still very itchy. I then noticed the arm that had the injection was hard and was also experiencing the same symptoms as my face and increased soreness. I took Benadryl that evening and woke up Sunday with improved symptoms but still noticeable soreness in the area of the injection and it was still a little red and hot to the touch. It is now Monday morning and the reaction has continued to improve with still some soreness and a little hot to the touch.

On Sunday 1/24/21-1/26 started with severe epigastric sharp upper abdominal pain, never had before. Was getting worse. Went to virtua ER on 1/26/21 evening, had ct scan with contrast showing fluid around galbladder and ultrasound showed wall thickening to 11mm, positive Murphy?s sign and fluid around galbladder. I was admitted overnight and surgeon had recommended removal due to ejection fraction of 12% from hida scan done on  1/27. Endoscopy was done also and was negative. Cholecysitis was the presumed diagnosis, with normal LFTS. I left and returned to ER where they did repeat ct scan showing distention , pain continued. Admitted for 1 night.  Pain was improving on Friday 1/29 , when I was discharged after repeated ultrasound showed resolved fluid. No history of any previous GI issues and no gallstones were noted on any imaging. I consume a healthy diet. Now having continued epigastric pain but improving.

At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

Migraine symptoms were relieved in 2 hours but still experienced some side effects of the medication such as dizziness. I got my 2nd dose of Moderna at 18:10, 2/17/21. I started to experience tingling sensation in my head at 23:00. The tingling was unilateral in the left parietal and left occipital areas. On 2/18/21, I experienced dizziness, fatigue, general weakness, bad headaches, and nausea. I took Acetaminophen 600mg at 22:00, and symptoms were gone on 2/19/20. But my migraines were more frequent since vaccination, but i did not take any medication for that. Today (2/22/21), some post vaccination symptoms are back, including headache, dizziness, fatigue.

                                                Right arm arm pit swollen where it looks like an extra titty. It?s sore and will ache . I have a tingle that runs down it every once in a while to my little pinky . It?s weaker than my left side .   I vaccinated 12/23 12/31 lump in tight armpit came up  1/4 got in with MD she said heat compress soak in Epsom salt baths Tylenol  1/20 came near 29 past 1st shot  called to ask if I still needed to take second one she told me no I was sent for blood work I can?t member the date . still there went back to md  Had CT done on 2/9  CT reading very vague in my opion and also the rheumatologist opion lol . Just states inflamed lymph nodes benign. She also sent me to rheumatologist due to sed rate elevated. He thinks it?s elevated due to arm swollen.  He also told me I need contact y?all cause he dose not think it?s autoimmune even though he checked me throughly and has ran labs today . He said he believes it?s from vaccination.

                                                I received the first dose of my moderna vaccine on February 9th. for 48 hours I had a sore left arm, where the vaccine was administered.   On February 14th I started experiencing paresthesias of the bilateral soles of my feet. Over the next couple of days the paresthesias were worsening and moving proximally until they were in both my lower extremities. They remained in my bilateral lower extremities for several days without moving further.   On February 21st around 11 pm I felt the paresthesias move up my posterior legs into my buttocks, up my back, and down my bilateral arms. I went to sleep and woke up on February 22nd and felt rectal pressure and increased saddle paresthesias and became concerned. I went to Hospital ED on February 22nd around 9 am.

                                                12/31 8:30am noticed maculopapular erythematous rash mostly on torso (few lesions on extremities), itchy scalp, and mild edema/erythema at RT corner of bottom lip. Also had mild pain on ball of RT foot, thought I had stepped on something. 1:30pm woke up with severe edema of bottom lip, rash also on scalp next to ears 3pm seen at urgent care, received and filled prednisone prescription  4pm lip edema started improving, so did not end up taking the prednisone 8pm lip edema gone, erythema and mild edema to DIP joint and tips of fingers, all fingers of LT hand and RT pinky. All hand joints and wrists sore. Soreness to toes and heels while walking but not at rest. Applied ice to fingers, then turned up heat. 1/1 3-4am finger edema/erythema totally resolved 8am foot pain starts resolving 5pm still with mild wrist pain, mild foot pain. Rash evolving -- most lesions improved but some have coalesced, new lesions on neck  Never any fever, checked x2, Tmax 99.0F. Did not end up taking any medications since my symptoms seemed to be resolving. Only other possible recent exposures were a new lotion tried 12/27 (but only applied to face, was careful to keep it away from my lips, and I did not have any rash on my face except the swollen lip) and a new dress that I did not pre-wash (but I had few lesions on my arms which would have also been exposed).

                                                A week after receiving the COVD19 vaccine, red patches of skin started appearing around the injection site.  Patches were not itchy.  Armpit area (lymph nodes) was painful, as well as general pain in left arm.  The next day the rash had gotten larger and left arm started tingling.  Arm pain persisted.  On the third day the rash was larger still, with prolonged arm tingling and left chest area pain.  I went to the ER as no one could answer why these problems were arising  a week after the vaccine.  ER advised taking Benadryl and watching out for shortness of breath.  Arm is currently tingling and eyesight seems fuzzy.

Marked for size and by 12/26 the lump, redness, swelling had increased in size.  Tylenol with no relief, applied heat to lump made it worse. Took Benadryl x 3 doses and symptoms are much improved.  Headache on 12/25-12/26, Fatigue x 3 days, muscle pain in shoulders/neck.

The health staff observing will also be submitting a VAERS report, as they provided interventions to the patient.

                                                The onset of symptoms started around 9:15am. I experienced numbness and tingling to bilateral feet and lower legs. I experienced dizziness. I also experienced an increased heart rate (160s-170s BPM). I was hyperventilating and had difficulty with breathing. I was pale and cold.  I had uncontrollable shakes. My BP was a bit higher than my normal but not hypertensive.  I was given candy and juice after onset of symptoms. ( I did have an English muffin prior to receiving the vaccine). My symptoms subsided for some time but then came back about 15 minutes later. These symptoms continued to occur about every 15 minutes for a period of close to 2 hours. I was given Benadryl 50mg PO after the first hour of symptoms. I continued to experience the symptoms for up to about 45 minutes after being given Benadryl. My symptoms began to subside and eventually stopped after the 2 hour mark.

                                                CO came to me at 1105 C/O fast heart beat and feeling a little SOB, thinking she was possibly having an anxiety attack. She was scared to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Then she said she did feel SOB and throat feels tight. I grabbed the EPI pen and injected 0.3mg into lateral right thigh. Brought patient to our emergency room, administered Benadryl 25mg (2 caps) po. Started IV NaCl 1000 mL in RAC. Administered famotidine 20mg/2ml IPV over 2 minutes. Currently on slow IV drip, 2nd bag. Patient is doing well. She was initially shaky after the EPI pen but throat did not feel tight less than 10 minutes after injection. Currently is relaxed as I monitor her. Vitals have been stable.

                                                I received my vaccination at my place of work. Local pharmacy came in to administer them.  In less then a minute of recieving the vaccination I experienced a tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  I told my symptoms to the  pharmacist that was there.  I had to take my mask off due to the difficulty breathing.  I sat down and was trying to catch my breath.  Roughly 10 -15 minutes passes then my throat began to swell.  My extremities were feeling tingly and I was very dizzy.  I sat with my neck extended to maintain my airway until they could locate some benedryl.  My voice was wheezy when attempting to answer questions the pharmacist was asking.  The pharmacist wanted to administer the EpiPen but I would not allow her to because then they would have to call 911.  It took about 45 minutes in total to locate benedryl.  I took 50 mg.  Roughly 15 -20 minutes after taking the benedryl I was able to breath with ease.  I waited about another 15 minutes at the facility to ensure I was ok.  I was told I would not be recieving the second dose due to my anaphylactic reaction.

A couple of hours after the injection I began itching all over. I deduced that it could be an allergic reaction so I took an antihistamine and relaxed.I did not check for hives as I don&#39;t know much about allergic reactions. the Itching went away. On day 8 I had the itching again accompanied by hives.  Once again I took an antihistamine and improved. On day 11 I had itching again and took an antihistamine. The antihistamine did not work as well this time. It is day 12 as I write this.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I spoke with the nurses regarding previous vaccine reactions, and we all agreed that I would take Benadryl first, and then get the vaccine. However, about 5-10 minutes after I got the vaccine, I began feeling very itchy, which is usually a precursor to when I develop hives. The nurses kept a close eye on me and got my vitals. They said my pulse was a little high, but that I was ok to go, since I had stayed my 30 minutes afterward and my vitals were ok. Throughout the day, I became even more itchy, and that night, I had hives everywhere, a low grade fever, and a migraine like headache. Because I did not have an itchy throat, and I have developed these symptoms before with the flu vaccine (and other allergies), I did not go to the doctor. The side effects took about a day to a day and a half to go away.

                                                Beyond the expected adverse symptoms I had (chills, headache, lots of pain at injection site) The longest and most unpleasant adverse event has been tenderness and pain of my armpit - of the arm where I was injected with vaccine. I do not feel any swelling of lymph nodes. Its been almost 7 days and this symptom has persisted. The area feels very sensitive and tender. The way I move my arm or hand causes pain of my armpit as well.

A general feeling of lethargy became progressively worse throughout the day. from morning to noon i felt off but thought i was just psyching myself out. My noon I realized i was experiencing side effects. Around 2pm i began to experience mild chills. While cooking dinner at around 5pm I felt like my muscle aches in my back were on the threshold of feeling likes spasms. around 8-9pm before going to bed the symptoms were at there worst and comparable to a moderate illness. By the next morning I felt about 80% better but got headaches between my eyes whenever i stood up or moved too fast. As of today I feel about 95% better but still somewhat lethargic.

By late afternoon I started feeling extreme muscle weakness in my whole body and had the chills. I took a hot bath to try to ease the pain and chill. After the bath I crawled into bed and experienced extreme fever, chills, and weakness through the night.   The next day I continued to suffer from extreme fatigue. Now it is evening of the day after the vaccine and I only feel a little weak.

                                                Beginning on Thursday, I had pain under my left arm, likely in lymph node. By Friday, I had pain under my right arm as well. On Saturday morning, I had a large red oval-shaped spot on my arm, starting about half an inch under the injection site. It was hot to the touch and the skin felt harder than the surrounding skin. It was not itchy or painful, but did cause some minor discomfort if I raised my arm high. Today, the color has faded to pink, but it is still a similar size.

                                                I received the vaccination on 1/14 and started to get an itching sensation that night - nothing noticeably or concern and was able to go to sleep. The next morning I was very itchy and red and started to break out in hives that started to get worse and spread through my body. I took Benadryl throughout the day and at night to help my sleep. On Saturday morning my eyes were swollen and red, I had severe hives all over my body and had to go to the ER for some type of relief. This was immediately after I woke up, the right side of my body was extremely hot and I went to the restroom and looked in the mirror and didn&#39;t recognize myself. At the ER, they put me on Prednisone - to take 2 tablets for 3 days, Famotidine - taking 1 tab, 2 times a day for 5 days, and Benadryl, 1 tab, 3X a day until the symptoms subside - It is currently 1/19 and my skin will start to heat up, primarily in my hands and start to itch, but no more hives or anything severe.  I am currently pregnant with my first child, due date 7/7/2021. I have had no previous pregnancies, miscarriages, or abortions.

Then about 5 minutes after leaving, I felt weak as if I was about to faint. Once I got to Peds, I felt even more weak. I could barely sit up. Nurse advised me to go back. Once I got there I was still feeling weak. I was sent home. The rest of the evening I was still feeling weak and as if I was about to get a headache, The next day (1/8), I felt muscle aches and tiredness. It hurt to even walk. As well my arm where I received the vaccine was sore and hurt to move.

                                                Exercised following injection. Noticed mildly sore arm within several hours. Much worse that night to the point that I was unable to lift things. Next day it was on/off pain, with very intense pain when it came on to the point that I was unable to lift or do things. On Sunday (next day), pain seemed to radiate from the shoulder up through my left neck to the cranium area. Monday (today) this evening - pain so intense that I was screaming and sobbing. Husband (also MD) had to medicate me as I was laying on bed screaming unable to move or roll over. He had to manually lift me. Significant pain in left neck (trapezius) area on inhales, near injection site. Pain has been getting worse each night.

                                                Initially after the vaccine I felt fine, after some time I began to feel very tired, drowsy and had a headache. As time past I started to get cold and began to get the chills. At this time I started taking my temperature which was running about 99-100F.  The chills became worse and I felt colder and sicker. My temperature climbed to 102.1 at which time I took some tylenol. My fever continued to climb to 103.1 within the next hour. The chills and fever lasted about 6-8 hours and then went away and I became very hot. I went to sleep that night after taking more tylenol just in case. The next morning I had severe fatigue, mild nausea  and a headache that stayed with me the rest of the day. I ended up going home from work due to the nausea and migraine type headache as well as intermittent chills that would come and go. By the next day 1/22 I was feeling much better over all. However a mildly painful red spot that was warm to touch appeared on my arm where the injection site was that stayed for the next 48 hours before disappearing.

                                                Patient is 30 y female who was 11 weeks pregnant with a singleton gestation EDC 8/10/2021. She received the first dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/14/2021. Over the ensuing 4 days, she experienced fevers to 99.3 F, a bumpy red rash accompanied by itching at the shot site, nausea, headache, and fatigue. Tylenol 500 mg/dose was used for temperature control. She then had two days of minimal symptoms, but on 1/21 experienced sudden swelling of her left arm at the shot site with rapid expansion of the rash. The rash was itchy and the arm was painful. She had a significant headache, fatigue, and temperature to 99.3 F.  These symptoms worsened over the next two days, with temperatures reaching 100 degrees F, continued headache, fatigue, and increased arm swelling.  On 1/23/2021 the arm began to improve, but fevers to 99.3, fatigue and headaches continued.  The rash had expanded to almost 12 cm x 6 cm. Tylenol 500 mg dosing was used for symptom control with some improvement.  By 1/26/2021 the rash had mostly disappeared, the headache was gone, fevers were gone, and the fatigue remained. In all, symptoms lasted 12 days post-vaccination.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine waiting my 15 minutes it felt tingling and burning sensation from my shoulder across my clavicle bone towards my heart. First 5 day (Tuesday-Sunday) symptoms: swollen, sore, red, &amp; bruised arm at injection spot; body aches, joint  pain of knees, fatigue, no energy, loss of appetite, dry mouth, headache, chills, nausea.  I felt better on the 6th day (Sunday), the injection site looked like it was healing and going back to normal on my shoulder. Then on 7th day (Monday) my injection spot started to itch and break out in a huge hive and little hives around it.  It turned into a bright red circle around the injection spot.  It was hot to touch and very swollen. On 8th to current day (11th) my arm keeps getting worse with the swelling, hotness, itching, &amp; redness, and spreading down my arm.

I had to take the day off work and slept most of the day.  I also had terrible muscular pain at the sight of the injection (L deltoid).  Tylenol helped with the arm pain. I had absolutely no side effects with the first dose.

                                                first 3 days, my arm was sore; On the 9th - I developed upper gastric pain that was radiating through my back up to my upper right shoulder. I was concerned since I&#39;m pregnant that it might have to do with the pregnancy. By 2:00 pain had progressively worsened and I didn&#39;t have much of a appetite that day. Around 3:30, I started developing intense nausea - and vomited 3:45 pretty violently. I contacted the OB - and she thought I should come in to be monitored. Hospital is where I went and I got there and they monitored to see how baby was doing; did a urine test - found protein and ketones in there. Drew labs - lipase was significantly elevated - 324. 156 were where my Triglycerides were at- a bit out of range. They dx&#39;d me with Pancreatitis - idopathic since they couldn&#39;t determine cause. They admitted me to Hospital from 9th - 16th. While I was in the hospital they did further lab work. I was showing malnourished - after a clear liquids only for two days. I asked to be discharged by 16th. On the 29th, the day I took the vaccine - I had a glucose tolerance test after the vaccine (about 08:30 AM is when I started the glucose monitoring test) - they diagnosed me with gestational diabetes with that two days after vaccine on December 31st. Expected due date - April 20, 2021; low PAP A hormone; 1st pregnancy

Had I been in the office I would have had to go home ill, and I could not do much but try to rest during this time. The headache through the following day was light and I felt mostly normal by evening.

                                                I had hives despite having taken my daily dose of Claritin that seemed to get worse as the day continued. I reached out to my Healthcare clinic and they were unsure if there was a simple treatment and almost required me to go the emergency room for this. I conducted a telehealth consultation with a doc who was not my primary care physician and was unfamiliar with my preexisting exercise urticaria condition that occasionally results in light hives but never anaphylaxis for me without Claritin. I declined going to the emergency room since this did not seem that serious and instead took another Claritin to try to get the somewhat worsening hives with no apparent cause to stop without an unnecessarily escalated situation. My throat was slightly itchy but I never became anaphylactic likely due to taking an additional Claritin and not doing anything requiring physical effort for the day beyond telecons from home because I left the office to telework mid morning after I started getting continually slightly worse hives. By evening I was ok and the next day just had a slightly sore throat but was able to work and just started the day with 2 Claritin without any further instance of hives appearing. The day after that I returned to my standard 1 Claritin dose with no ill effects. From this event, it seems clear that a 72 hour downing period from dose 1 is insufficient and should be upped to 96 hours. Prior to this more severe event, I had, on days 2 and 3, a sore left arm at injection site that prevented me from even reasonably lifting my arm to a height sufficient to grab my cell phone off it&#39;s charger while lying in bed without serious discomfort. That level of arm discomfort prevented me from working out or would have prevented me from anything other than light office work involving my vaccine arm. My level of tiredness for the couple days following this dose also required that I take an hour long nap days 1 and 2, and no nap at all is usually the norm for me.

Chest felt tight, upper stomach in extreme discomfort,  Hard to see, lights hurting eyes, seeing spots in the air.  Sound became amplified and began to experience a migraine.  &#34;People talking low to me felt like they were screaming into my ear drums.&#34; Extreme fatigue so could barely keep eyes open.  Standing was difficult; moved to wheelchair. Most symptoms lasted 2 to 3 days.  Fever of 102 on first day only.  Fatigue for one week.  Right upper arm, not at the injection site, had a &#34;hive&#34; about the size of a nickel that has not gone away (as of 2/23/21).   New migraines with light sensitivity that affect ability to work also have not gone away (as of 2/23/21).

Stiffness in the joint started progressing to the point of patient having trouble taking off her socks and walking. Patient was walking with a painful limp. At 12:30 AM on 2-1-21 patient awoke with pain radiating down left leg and could not bend leg or move in bed. The pain lessened a Medrol pack relieved pain for two days. On 2-4-21, patient awoke with such pain that she went to the emergency room. Sciatica was the diagnosis which patient has never had. Patient awoke with severe pain again on 2-7-21 and had another trip to the emergency room. Sciatica was determined the problem again and a CT was ordered that showed no back or disc issues. Pain and difficulty walking has continued to persist even with medication and physical therapy. Patient is using a walker with continued decreased strength and pain in the left leg and hip.

                                                Immediately after injection, arm felt some tingling that subsided. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

                                                I have been experiencing tinnitus and potential hearing lose in right ear. When I first noticed it, I had a numbness by my right ear which subsided but three weeks later, I still have a ringing in my ear which I have never had issues with my ears and I am nervous to get the second dose. There are multiple reports of this very thing on website and it is concerning.

I was moderately ill with covid, but did not require hospitalization. I was offered a vaccine and accepted on 12/28/20. I got the modern vaccine.  On 12/29 AM I developed significant symptoms. I was so exhausted and sore I was barely able to complete my cases for the day. I only had a temp max of 99.7, but I felt worse the I did when I had covid (except for the respiratory symptoms). I came home by noon in 12/29 and took Motrin then went to sleep by 1400. As soon as I woke up on 12/30 I took aleve 400 mg and felt well enough to work the next day. Symptoms improved progressively in the subsequent days.

In the morning I felt normal, besides some remaining pain and redness surrounding the injection site.

On 1/1/2021, I woke up with a very swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck. I was very tired and had no energy for three days. The lymph node is still swollen and I am 9 days out from the vaccine.

My arm was sore for the first few days after the injection, but then the soreness got better. I hadn&#39;t really looked at my arm closely since the day after the vaccine, so I am not sure if it was there before. I was not able to report this on the CDC v-safe website because it has been over a week and I stopped getting the daily check-in links. I am not sure if I will get another link for 1 week. This is why I am sending this here.

                                                Around bedtime on the day of injection, developed a fever of 99.8 and a terrible headache. My left arm was very painful, even when not touching it or moving it. When I woke up in the morning, fever was higher (100.7) and I was so weak I could barely walk to the bathroom. I felt very dizzy and tired. I drank water and took ibuprofen for the pain. Stayed on the couch all day and took ibuprofen PM to sleep last night. Woke up very early today with a fever of 99.4 and still a bad headache and weak. Walking to the bathroom makes me feel like I need a nap.

                                                Presumed right arm muscle injury.  Several hours after the injection my arm was extremely sore and painful. The joint was painful as well. No redness or swelling. It was tender to touch. I was having difficulty reaching my arm up or moving it upward. Ex: it hurt to lift my hand to touch my face.  I also couldn?t let it fall. If I got my arm above my head I would have to assist it down. I couldn?t sleep that night because of the pain. I was having trouble with pushing movements in that arm. And also letting it hang dependently (like letting my arm hang when I hinged forward). I started taking Motrin 24 hours after the injection. Motrin helped, so I took it Friday and Saturday. Sunday, my arm felt 99% back to normal.  Monday and Tuesday I didn?t notice anything.   Wednesday  morning I woke up with the same pain again and difficulty moving my arm. Wednesday night, I couldn?t sleep again because of the pain/couldn?t get my arm in a comfortable position. I?m taking Motrin, with not as much relief as before. I?ve applied heat and I?ve tried to stretch it as well.   The only way i really know how to describe it? is that it feels as if my deltoid was injured. And my other muscles are fine. It?s hindering my movement in that arm. It is again, tender to touch my deltoid area. The tightness has extended in to my shoulder and neck. It has now been 8 days since my vaccination.

This got better. On day 7 after getting the vaccine I developed a firm, raised, HOT and extremely itchy area at the site of injection. This is measuring at 5cm by 5 cm on my Left deltoid.  This continues to get larger and larger.  I have also had daily headaches since the vaccine was given. I seen a doctor who recommended calling the CDC who then advised me to complete a VAERS report.

My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

Continued back to my office. Informed my supervisor that I was feeling dizzy but informed him that I had a couple bites of oatmeal, and a few cups of coffee and was going to try and eat something and hydrate and I?m sure I would feel better. I went back to work for about an hour (I work at a desk). For about an hour I continued to feel dizzy and noticed I was cloudy and was staring off. After an hour I really became dizzy and walked to my supervisors office and informed him. It felt as though I was walking on the moon to get to his office. I also felt like I had a uti. I sat down in his office and informed him of what happened. As I was talking to him I began to pass out. I did not go out the whole way but he began speaking to me more. After feeling a little better I walked back over to my office. I felt waves of dizziness and being hot and cold. My husband came and picked me up around 1:30p from work. I felt better after getting in the car and going home. Once I was home I ate and had began to feel better. Around 6:00p I began to go through another wave and was experiencing body aches, hot and cold sweats, loss of appetite, tingling all over my body but mostly in my legs and feet. At that point I went in and laid down in bed for the rest of the night. Probably around 9:00p I began to feel better. I attempted to fall asleep around 11:00p but when I closed my eyes I felt like they were racing back and forth. So I got back up and watched something in tv until I fell asleep maybe about 30 minutes later. I woke up the next morning around 8:45a. I tossed and turned most of the night, however I felt better. It was like I had the flu for a few days and on the last day I felt better but was under the weather. At this point in the morning I was fatigued. I was able to perform some tasks around the house.  I then laid back down in bed for a few hours because I was beginning to feel dizzy and was experiencing hot and cold sweats. After a few hours I got up from bed and performed a few more tasks around the house. Then was able to sit down on the couch and watch some tv. At this point I?m still expediting tingling in my body at times. Still a little dizzy but able to focus and hot and cold sweats.

My arm, at the injection site, was very sore for 2-3 days after. On 1/08/21 I noted a small red spot at the injection site that I thought was a bruise; however, on the evening of 01/09/21 I noticed it had grown to approximately 3 inches in diameter. It was red, a little swollen and a little itchy.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

Slight shoulder pain right of the day, with a headache starting after 30 min. Later that night around 10-11pm i woke up with a splitting headache, chills, cold sweat and had a fever of 100.7. Took tylenol, woke up feeling better.  Mild headache lasted 3 days, when headache stopped heaviness/pain started in my left armpit - huge swollen lymph node (injection side). Was painful for 1.5 wks, this past week the lymph node is still swollen but not painful. I tried to go for a run 3 days after injection, I was short of breath and legs felt heavy (usually walk 2 miles daily with dogs, run 3-4 miles 3-4x/wk) figured that went along with swollen lymph node. Today is the first day I was able to run without difficulty catching my breath and my legs don&#39;t feel as heavy (2 miles, slow jog vs run).

                                                Just over 24 hours after I received the COVID-19 vaccine I had a syncope episode while standing talking to others at work. I began feeling hot, started feeling like I was sweating, started seeing black and white lines, and then fainted. The symptoms came on very quickly. I did not remember falling and we believe I hit my head on the corner of a table when I fell, and I had to get 3 staples in my head. I have no other medical concerns at this time, and all of the test run at the ER showed no concerns. At the ER they ran labs, took a CT scan, and did an EKG. I was released from the ER after about 4 hours. I have had a 3 other episode previously when I felt like I was going to pass out, most recent March 2020, but they were linked to the flu and strep. This event has not been linked to either of those conditions at this time, and my doctor encouraged me to report it.

                                                Painful arm until Sunday, then throat felt tight, thought it was acid reflux so I took some tums. The heart palpitations started shortly after. Worse when lying down and almost felt short of breath. The heart palpitations continued until Monday night and Tuesday I woke up and palpitations resolved. I have only ever had this reaction one other time when had the Mirena. Symptoms resolved after having it removed but wasn?t sure what ingredients caused it. Now I believe there may be a common ingredient.

Then rapid heart rate and chest tightness by 2.5hrs post vaccine. I went to urgent Care and they thought it was an allergic reaction (BP 182/90, HR 82) and gave me 125mg solumedrol and Benadryl intramuscularly which caused worsened dizziness and a racing heart which caused me to collapse and they gave me a epi pen and called 911. I was transferred to ER and they completed EKG which was normal and monitored vitals for a few hours and I was released. I continue to remain extremely dizzy and nauseated 2days after the vaccine.

My chest became tight, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I was light headed and dizzy. The next two days after I was extremely lethargic. I could bravely stay awake for more that 20 minutes at a time for the first two days. I was also extremely hungry but still had the metallic taste in my mouth. Until day 3 I would still feel like my tongue felt hairy when the benedryl would wear off.On day 3 I became nauseous and broke out in hives on my hands and neck. I did not fully feel like I had my energy back and was like ?myself? until 4 days after receiving the vaccine

Within a few hours, face began to flush and feel hot and itchy.  Saw a NP who ruled out cellulitis and recommended Benadryl.  Took 2 Benadryl tablets by noon on day 8 and almost immediately noticed facial itching/&#34;hot&#34; sensation improving. Within 2-3 hours, rash began to fade in color. Continued taking Benadryl as directed on box and by the end of day 9 rash had almost faded to nothing with no residual symptoms remaining.

                                                12 hours after injection (1/8/2021) I began running a low grade fever (99.8), experiencing a debilitating headache, had injection site tenderness as well as swelling the size of a baseball. I iced the injection site and put compression on, in case it was a hematoma from the injection. From 1/8/2021 -1/10/2021 I continued to run a low grade fever, never reaching above 100 degrees. I had full body aches and was exhausted as if a bus ran me over. The injection site swelling slowly reduced with continued ice and compression. From 1/10/2021 - 1/13/2021 I did not have a fever, however I continued to experience intermittent headaches that were as painful as several days prior. I felt chronically exhausted as well. On 1/14/2021 I began to run a low grade fever again (99.8). At this point the injection side swelling was a 6.5cm x 5cm ring of what I believe to be induration. Headache and exhaustion persisted. Friday 1/15/2021 I did not have a fever, but I began to notice that simple tasks such as walking to the kitchen were increasingly difficult. When checked, my oxygen saturation was 98 percent, but my heart rate was 115 while sitting. Saturday 1/16/2021 I began running a fever again, this time reaching 100 degrees. I developed a full body rash, red spots never raised. Again, I continued to have extreme exhaustion and headaches and tachycardia. I took some benadryl to help with the rash. Sunday 1/17/2021 the rash and fever returned, headaches and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia continued. Monday 1/18/2021 I began having a sore throat, fever and rash developed again. Headache and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia as well. Tuesday 1/19/2021 my fever elevated to 100.5, headache, exhaustion, sore throat, tachycardia. However, by Tuesday there was no longer red visible spots. My entire body still itched and felt as if there was a burning sensation, however I could not find any visible red spots to correlate with the itching and burning. Today Wednesday 01/20/2021 I have never felt worse. My entire body feels like it has been repeatedly ran over by a semi truck. My throat hurts. My head hurts. My body burns as if it&#39;s on fire. I am so incredibly tired I feel like it&#39;s an extreme sport just to get out of bed and walk to the bathroom. My fever today 01/20/2021 reached a new 101.4, I&#39;m still tachycardic. Oxygen saturation is within normal limits. However, the induration around the injection site seems to have almost completely resolve.

On January 16th, I noticed that my arm began to ache again. Then on January 17th, I developed redness, warmth, and swelling, which has continued to expand down my arm. I reported this to employee health, who recommended I report to this site, was not allowing me to self report.

                                                The vaccine itself was well tolerated with just some injection site pain and minor body aches the next day. Then, last night I took miralax and had an allergic reaction to it. I have taken miralax in the past and I have tolerated it well. This is my first time taking miralax since the Covid vaccine and I suspect it is related since there is polyethylene glycol in the vaccine. About 10 minutes after taking the miralax (in water) I had chest and throat tightness, rash on my chest and face, severe facial flushing, and itching. After that began to resolve I had chills, rigors, and aches in every joint. I had not eaten or consumed anything else and had no exposure to any other potential allergens.

Results did not show any reason to have electrical shocks so  pt was told to take ibuprofen and keep back iced. On 1/19 pt is still having electrical shocks and stated she feels like her nerves are going haywire.  Pt said her skin feels like bugs are crawling on her.  Pt is in a lot of pain and was told to get a referral to see a neurologist in a week if not any better.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 10:45a, I then went next door to be monitored for 15 minutes. Within a few minutes, I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I waited out the 15 minutes and went back to my office. When I got into my office I still felt lightheaded and I informed my supervisor. I explained to him that I was going to try and eat something and drink some water and I would feel better. I went into my office and continued to work for the next hour. After that hour, I began to feel very dizzy and &#34;out of it&#34; as I almost didn&#39;t know where I was at. I went to speak to my supervisor and I sat down in his office where I almost fainted. He took me back to my office where I sat with another co-worker. Duri time, I continued to feel light headed, although it came in waves. My husband drove me home, I showered, ate something and was feeling better. Around 6:00p, I began to feel lightheaded again and began to experience body aches, hot and cold flashes that would come in waves. Saturday morning, I woke up feeling better, but around 10:00a I began to experience the same symptoms. I laid down for a few hours that would get up and attempt tasks around the house, then I would  ended up back in bed at 6:00p with the same symptoms again. I did meet virtually with a doctor and she explained to me to wait it out. On Monday, I met with my pcp and she informed me of the same, that these symptoms would eventually go away. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the only symptom that remained was the dizziness. At times, I still will feel dizzy for instance Saturday morning I woke up and felt pretty dizzy throughout the day.

I do not know if it is related to the vaccine or not. I do not feel ill. I do not have a temperature. I have minor pain in my arm and am somewhat achy, but like I said, blood being in the toilet is not normal so it does worry me.

                                                I got the vaccine on Jan 5th. Felt fine that night but the next morning I had an inflammatory response. Every area of my body that I&#39;ve injured as an adult was swollen and sore. My jaw where I had my wisdom teeth removed last year, my knee that I had surgery on about 2 years ago, any part that had previously had been injured. That night I was tired but felt back to normal on the 7th. On the 13th I went to the gym and did upper body and that night I started to have a reaction at the injection site. On the 14th my arm had swelled significantly and turned bright red, I went to our health clinic and was put on steroids to calm things down. I think exercising my upper body a week after the shot made me have that reaction, like exercising the muscle made the vaccine secrete faster or something.

On day 1, about 17 hours from vaccination, I woke up with lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea. Felt like I was going to pass out. Laid down, and it passed. Continued with myalgias, fevers, chills, fatigue on day 1. By day 2, I felt normal. I took tylenol day 0 and day 1.

I drank 1.5 L of water and put some topical Benadryl cream on the hives, these symptoms resolved. At 8pm I began to get a temperature (temp max 101.2 around 11:17pm), a very sore swollen arm, massive headache, and myalgia/arthralgia in knees bilaterally. On 1/5 temperature has subsided to low grade (99.2F) but I still don?t feel well and have no sense of smell with a runny nose.

The nurse who administered the vaccine inspected the injection site and did not see any issues. The patient stayed in the area for 50 minutes for monitoring. Her vital signs were taken and were within normal limits, she ambulated in the room and moved her right upper extremity freely including coordination exercises.  Numbness/coldness was still present at 13:42, but slowly improved.  As of 01/07/2021, patient&#39;s arm numbness has resolved but has had intermittent tingling in legs and feet.  Continuing to monitor.

At got better and was normal by day 3.  Today, 7 days from day of injection, I woke up with my left arm (injection side) sore and inflamed, arm was warm to touch and hurt when I pushed. There&#39;s a mass of dense/sore area, sort of feels like a dense lump.  Area around on skin is itchy - has been this way all day. Tonight the swollenness and itchiness is traveling into left armpit as well.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had soreness and mild fatigue. The soreness and stiffness was greatest in the arm of injection, and was less intense but present in my upper back and neck. This soreness and stiffness lasted the whole day after the vaccine but was becoming milder, until day 2 after the vaccine when it had completely resolved. No medications were required.  Day 1 after vaccine I also had a bright red, flat, rash that appeared as very close small circles near the injection site (where the bandage was placed) but not on the actual vaccine site. No itching, spreading of rash, or other symptoms. This resolved day 2. I have no known allergies to bandages at this time. No medications were required.

She states that immediately after her lips felt tingly.  She states that she was driving home and she began to feel tingling and numbness into her face around her mouth.  Patient denies having any allergies. Was walking her to the ED and she was talking to nurse, all of a sudden she leaned forward and was coughing and grabbing her throat. Rapid response team called, patient transferred to ED. She gets influenza thoughts without difficulty.  She denies any current URI symptoms no history of heart or lung problems high blood pressure or diabetes.  She denies numbness or tingling in her hands currently.  Currently very nauseated. Patient was given some BENADRYL and some Zofran was watched she still complained of some perioral numbness some labs were obtained potassium is minimally low at 3.5 calcium is also low at 8.1.  This time I suspect this is more of an adverse reaction to immunization shot however if the tingling or numbness persists then a recheck of her electrolytes may be warranted follow-up primary care physician.

Left arm stop hurting after 1 day but the lump is still there.  On 1/12/21,  I start noticing my underarm starting to hurt.  I thought I pulled a muscle or maybe a swollen lymph node. Did a self examination no swollen lymph so I thought it was a pull muscle. Been taking Advil twice a day but now it is the 1/14/21 underarm still hurt and the lump on the left arm is still there and slightly swollen now. Still taking Advil twice a day due to left underarm pain.

Took on empty stomach and felt nauseated and went and vomited. No other reactions other than fatigue and low appetite and sore arm the rest of the day. Ate less that day and so did get nausea off and on during the day - but not as severe and no more vomiting. 25th - everything resolved.  6/16/21 - estimated date of delivery. 1st pregnancy. Has been a normal pregnancy.

                                                Severe arm pain at injection site night of.  At 5:15 AM the following morning (1/14/21) I experienced lightheadedness and fainted off the toilet hitting my face on the wall/radiator in front of me.  My husband (who witnessed the fainting episode) stated I began convulsing and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head for 5-10 seconds. Upon regaining consciousness I was covered in sweat. After being assisted back to bed, I had nausea and headache with continued severe pain at injection site. I went to the ER around 6:45 AM since my severe headache, dizziness and nausea continued and to examine if I broke my nose in the fall. While in triage at the ER I experienced severe nausea and a second episode of fainting.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

My pulse and blood pressure went up. I got dizzy and lightheaded. Maybe 5-7 minutes after the onset, it started to get better on its own. No medicine was given. The paramedic did an ekg which was normal. My blood pressure and pulse also went back to normal.  My oxygen level was normal. Later that evening and the following day, the only noticeable difference was extreme fatigue and a headache. I was dizzy and lightheaded for a few hours after.

                                                Lightheadedness in the 5 minutes following the SARS Cove 2 vaccine #1 that rapidly progressed to lower abdominal cramping, AMS, eyes rolling upwards, and hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 70s?80s/40s that promptly improved following IM epinephrine.  Diphenhydramine, famotidine, methylprednisolone, and a LR bolus was administered.  Following IM epinephrine administration, the patient&#39;s hemodynamic instability promptly improved along with her mentation.  Patient was monitored for 4.5 hours before being discharged home under the care of her partner with a EpiPen autoinjector kit.

                                                Patient had her first Moderna COVID vaccination at 4:00 PM today and 5 min later felt dizziness, worsening, associated with headache, nausea, sore throat, hot flashes, and dizziness is from side to side when she looks at her phone, no dizziness when she does not look at it. Patient primary complaint is headache on bilateral temples. All other symptoms resolved, and no dizziness if not looking at phone.  Patient has history of headaches, similar in quality, but this is more intense (6/10 intensity, less than her scoliosis pains, but more than usual headache pain), but otherwise the same, pounding sensation, and she can feel throbbing. Headache is about the same currently. Started simultaneously as dizziness, immediately, unchanged. No changes in vision. Peak intensity of headache around 30 min after onset, peak at 4:30 or so.  Patient notified the vaccine clinic staff and was instructed to be observed in another area, and did not improve. Patient remembered that her initial blood pressure was low and it fluctuated. Patient was then sent to the ED.  Upon initial assessment in the Emergency Department 2 hours after her initial injection, the assessment is likely vasovagal near syncope with tension headache, rather than true allergic reaction. Given metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, normal saline, and obtained labs.

                                                Was 7 weeks pregnant, due Aug 30, nothing adverse happening to pregnancy. Shortly after that shot i had a sore arm and left armpit lymph nodes for a few days. I noticed yesterday, a week after the shot, the lymph nodes were still a little sore. Then yesterday afternoon, my left shoulder started itching like crazy at the injection site, lasting for a couple hours. I looked and it was red where it itched, like three splotches the size of quarters but not very defined. This morning it is red over a larger swath, like a palm and a half on my shoulder. Feels sore and slightly hard under the skin, rather than itchy.

Continued though out night. Sunday - same symptoms but less painful (rate it around a 9/10) - went to store to get groceries with husband around 8:30pm and almost passed out, super weak and felt like puking - not sure if it was just the mask making it hard to breathe. Monday - woke drenched in sweat but not as bad as over the weekend, still achy but not as bad, headache, arm is still super sore and enlarged, hot to touch, fatigue, malaise - but able to go to work (pain down to 6/10, so definitely better than before)

                                                Face swelling and redness with lip tingling and tongue tingling later after eating a few bites of a home prepared meal that has been eaten several times before. Started eating around 7 pm, have picture of red and swelling face at 7:11 pm. Contents of meal were shrimp, homemade egg noodles, chicken stock, pork, and romaine.  No breathing problems and felt fine besides face warm ness and some anxiety over possibly developing a new allergy, as these symptoms were similar to my adult onset allergies to oysters in 2011. Sought remote care at 7:41, spoke to RN over phone who recommended a video visit, then after video visit was recommended to go to urgent care. Arrived at Urgent Care around 8:50 PM.   Had a steroid shot of solumedrol 125 mg to IM the left arm around 9 pm, then took some Benadryl and famotidine at urgent care. Picked up prescriptions for famotidine 7 days, prednisone 4 days, and Benadryl as needed.  Taking medications now with careful watching of potentially allergic reaction provoking foods such as shrimp, fish, nuts, and wheat.

Patient is a nurse.  She received her 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19 the day prior to arriving in the emergency department.  This morning she did feel some mild body aches but otherwise was feeling fine.  Starting later today after her shift at work she developed severe body aches bilateral upper shoulders and down her spine, she also reports some shortness of breath, dizziness.  She felt unsafe to drive home feeling like this.  She had taken some Advil earlier in the day around 10:00.  She denies any fever, nausea or vomiting.  No history of severe vaccine reaction or anaphylaxis.  She has had anaphylactic reaction to Enbrel prior.  She denies any throat swelling, muffled voice, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain.    patient is mildly tachycardic and hypertensive.  Likely due to pain.  Patient is experiencing adverse reaction to the 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  I discussed with her she is having an immune response to the vaccine.  She does have a history of rheumatoid arthritis which could contribute to the elevated immune response as well.  The patient is given 30 mg of IM Toradol for body aches here in the emergency department.  She is instructed to call PCP for close follow-up, rest, drink plenty of fluids.  She has no signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis at this point.

                                                I didn&#39;t have any symptoms other than a sore arm for the first day or two.  On Monday, my left arm started to hurt in a different way.  When I push on it, it is not sore anymore.  Now, when I try to lift my left arm, even a little bit, I have quite a bit of pain internally, in  my upper arm/ shoulder. I feel as though this is not from the actual vaccination, but possibly from how it was administered into my shoulder.  I do realize this is only day 3, but it has gotten worse from yesterday to today.

                                                Started feeling a lump forming under my right armpit. At first it wasn&#39;t hurting that much I just felt it was normal of the swelling and soreness, but then I started feeling more pain at night time when I tried to sleep. On Monday the 25th woke up feeling more pain bigger then a pea on my right armpit had a fever of 100.1 in the morning. I went to the doc around the same day in the afternoon. The doc said it was an infection and inflamed from the vaccine I recently got on Friday.

There is no soreness or tenderness when touched. The rash first appeared this morning.  I am closely watching it to see if it spreads or goes away.   My left arm was sore after receiving the vaccine but the soreness decreased each day and was gone by the 3rd day after receiving the vaccine. I expected something like that to happen.  I did not expect to see a rash a week after receiving the vaccine.

By 11pm I had a horrible headache and my body was aching. At midnight I still was feeling horrible and my chest was hurting and I was having difficulty breathing. Checked my heart rate with a pulse ox and it was in the 150?s. I realized had not taken my clonidine pill yet for the evening so I  took it and waited about an hour to hour an a half and my heart rate was still not coming down below 125. I ended up going to the emergency room and getting there by 3am. They immediately started running tests. My heart rate was in the 138 and my blood pressure was 148/100

I had confirmed pregnancy with home positive test and missed period. I had an estimated due date of 9/24/2021.  This was my 4th pregnancy. I have had two uncomplicated pregnancies to term. In September 2020 experienced a chemical pregnancy with early pregnancy loss at 5 weeks.  The first 24 hours after 1st dose of vaccine I experienced extreme arm soreness in the arm that was vaccinated,  causing  headache and unable to sleep. After 24 hours I felt &#34;normal&#34;. 2 weeks and 3 days following the first dose of Moderna, I  had a miscarriage. On the night of 2/15/21 I lost the pregnancy with vaginal bleeding, bright red  blood, passing tissue, clots/ sac. I had an uneventful pregnancy up to that point, feeling well as I had with prior pregnancies.

After about 20 minutes, I couldn&#39;t feel the left side of my face and the left side of my body was like with you go to the dentist and have lidocaine.  The next day I felt like I had been hit by a mack truck. I felt like that until about January 6, 2021. I also had SOB, joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue and body aches, sore arm and redness at the injection site.

                                                Bells palsy; Pregnancy; A spontaneous report was received from a physician, who was also a 32-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA- 1273) during pregnancy and the patient has been diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy after delivery.  The patient&#39;s medical history included exercise induced asthma. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included ascorbic acid/betacarotene/calcium sulfate/colecalciferol/cyanocobalamin/ferrous fumarate/folic acid/nicotinamide/pyridoxine hydrochloride/retinol acetate/riboflavin/thiamine mononitrate/tocopheryl acetate/zinc oxide and omeprazole.  On 23 DEC 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 011J20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 20 JAN 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 029L20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unknown date, an ultrasound and quad screen (levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), estriol and inhibin A in pregnant women&#39;s blood) were performed, and the results were normal. There were no complications during the pregnancy.  On 01 Feb 2021, the patient delivered the baby. No other delivery or infant details were reported.   On 10 Feb 2021, the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy. No treatment information was provided.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the reported event, Bell&#39;s Palsy, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Severe pain in my arm from the time I received the shot. Could not use my entire left arm at all for a month. Tingling down to my fingertips. Required multiple trips to an orthopedic specialist. Multiple courses of medication.  First diagnose&#39; was SIRVA, followed by frozen shoulder.  Still having pain and issues to this day. Limited use of my left shoulder. Injection site was too high.

                                                About 12 hours after the vaccine I started to have body aches and chills. I took Ibruprofen that evening and when I woke up the next morning I had a low grade fever of 99.5, I took Ibruprofen that morning and began sweating. I was sweaty/clammy all day, had a headache and tired. Around 4pm I took a 1.5 hour nap and felt better after that. The next morning I believe I had another low grade fever because I was really cold when I went to sleep, but woke up sweating. After that I have not had any symptoms.

It felt like my arm was on fire for a few minutes but eventually went away. my arm became sore about an hour after the injection but it wasn&#39;t bad. a few hours passed and I started noticing my right arm that I received the vaccine in started really hurting and tingling was shooting down my arm and into my fingers. on January 5, 2021 I could not lift my arm with out crying because the pain was so intense. The sight of where the vaccine was administered was red and very swollen. there is a noticeable lifted knot on my arm the size of a gold ball. the sight around the area of administration is red, and sore and warm to touch. the tingling feeling also was present when waking up on Jan 5, 2021.  around 230 pm, my arm still very sore and the knot on my arm is still visible and sore to touch. the tingling feeling slowly starting to subside.

                                                I have a history of migraines, but since starting emgality injections in september, had been doing much better.  I only had 1 migraine in November an hasn&#39;t had any in Dec until 12/30 (6 days post vaccine). I took my rescue medication (ubrelvy), and the migraine came back again the next day, so I took my medication again. On 1/1 the headache was really bad and the medication did not work. All I could do was sleep and when waking up from a nap I took my medication again, and it didn&#39;t help again. This is the first time my migraine has not responded to my medication. I still had the headache on 1/2.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

These symptoms resolved after a day, but I have had a poorly delineated area of erythema, warmth, edema and pruritus at the injection site that began on day two post-vaccine and has been increasing in size until today (day 5 post-vaccination). Started as a small (2 cmx2cm) wheal, now  appears as painful/itching and warm blanching urticaria that takes up the entire width of my upper arm and half the length of the upper arm.

                                                I have a history of prior anaphylaxis in 2009 when I received (separate arms, same date and time) the 2009 seasonal flu vaccine and the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. Both were from multi-dose vials and providers I established care with following the reaction believed I likely had a reaction to a preservative. I?ve received single-dose flu vaccines with no issues since then. When I received the Moderna covid vaccine on 1/8/21 I had some right-sided throat swelling about 15 minutes after injection. It did not worsen and I was monitored for 1 hour after shot time. I went home and the feeling in my throat resolved after about 4-5 hours with no medication or intervention needed. I did not have any other symptoms until 3pm on 1/9/21. Started with mild abdominal pain, an hour and a half later I had chills, headache, fatigue and fever around 100.8F. No medication taken. The fever resolved within about 6-7 hours. On Sunday 1/10/21 the abdominal pain worsened and was a constant pain around umbilical region that felt as if it radiated outward, LLQ slightly worse. It was severe, directly affected normal daily functions. I could not walk, move, eat or drink room-temp water without pain increasing.  Walking 20ft at one point even caused me to crumble to the floor and cry, had to stay there for 5 minutes before even attempting to get back to the couch. No diarrhea, no vomiting, no fever, no nausea. I did have loss of appetite. The pain continued through the night and was constant. I could not find a comfortable position to lay in and tossed and turned most of the night. At 0430 on 1/11/21 I got up out of bed to pee, abdominal pain was so bad it kept me awake for about an hour after. Pain finally started to improve and I was able to sleep from 0530-0930. When I woke up on 1/11/21 around 0930 my abdominal pain was very mild and continued to improve as the day went on. Currently (1600 on 1/11/21) my abdomen feels about 90% better, I have no other symptoms. The symptoms, specifically the fever and abdominal pain, caused me to miss 2 days of work (Sunday 1/10/21 and Monday 1/11/21).

Patient was taken to the ED for observation, remained hypotensive (90&#39;s/50&#39;s) for about an hour, then slowly returned to normal BP (110&#39;s/80&#39;s) over another hour. Patient likely did not require going to the ED, however was taken there as a precaution due initially to the length of time passed out and hypotension.  Prior to this episode, the patient only experienced soreness at the injection site. Following this episode, the patient felt some weakness and had a mild headache for another 24 hours before returning to baseline.

                                                Around 2 AM, roughly 14 hours after receiving Covid Modena vaccine (1st dose) I woke up in a violent shaking situation.  I could not stop shaking, it was more than just the ?chills? I thought my teeth were going to break they were so tough. It made me hyperventilate because I was so worked up , almost like I couldn?t catch my breath from body being so tense from shaking.  This lasted all night, around 8 am, the ?shakes? became less severe and I then felt like it was a 100 degrees, sweating ALOT.  This lasted all day.  Saturday my body hurt so badly, my muscles and joints hurt so much it hurt to move my toes, I cried and cried and I am a very tough person but this was not normal by any means.  By Sunday I was feeling somewhat better but I wouldn?t and won?t go through this again , my arm still feels like an elephant was sitting on it.  I understand your body makes reactions to vaccines because it recognizes it and is preparing it for antibodies to be made but this was not a normal situation , so much I am almost positive I will not take the second dose, nobody knows how I felt and I will say honestly , this was a horrible and scary thing.

                                                Immediately following the injection there was injection pain at the site and the muscle function was immediately impacted.  For around 36 hours afterward I was unable to raise my left arm above my shoulder.  After that I was able to do so first with pain, pain subsided after around 48 hours.  Beginning 1/8/2021 I had muscle spasms in my lower left abdomen directly to the right of my left hip bone.  The spasms were not painful, but we?re intrusive and constant.  After around 24 hours they subsided and that region became very sore due to the muscles being overworked by the spasms.  On this day I also developed a headache and low grade fever.  The headache is at its worst when I stand up.  6 days after the vaccination I still have a constant minor headache and get pangs and jolts of pain in the top of my head when I stand up and am nearly constantly fatigued.

                                                On the 7th day after the reaction, I woke up with a slightly sore arm. When I looked in the mirror I also noticed my arm was red around the injection site - approximate size of 3x2 inches (tape measure all I had). It does itch somewhat as well as is a bit swollen in the area. Not warm to touch. No fever. This is a new, delayed-onset reaction as I experienced only a sore arm the day after the vaccination and no rash.  No medications are needed at this time as I am able to go about my ADLs.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

                                                I received my first dose of the moderna vaccine. About 10 minutes after the 15 minute observation period, I began to feel tingling and  pins and needle like sensation throughout my bilateral arms to hands. Also an itchy throat for 5-10 mins that resolved. Throughout the day the pins and needles seemed to be more generalized from my head,  torso to legs and feet. I continued to feel this through the night. I again continue to feel the generalized pins and needles the next day after my injection.  I didn?t think much of it until researching  that this may be considered a ?serious adverse effect?. I would like further direction if it is safe to go ahead with my second dose next month.

Still a little swollen and warm to touch.

                                                December 29-31, 2020 Terrible headache, body aches, fatigue, diarrhea, sore right arm.  Jan 1-2, 2021 Headache, loose stool Jan 3, 2021 I woke up with a red, warm, itchy, rash at vaccine injection site on right arm. The rest was the size of a baseball. The rash was painful to the touch. Jan 4, 2021 The rash turned hard like cellulitis and was not as red. Still warm to the touch and itchy.  Jan 5-7, 2021 The right arm rash seemed to be improving, it was not as red and the hardness went away. There were little red dots in a ring where the circle of the rash had been.  Jan 8-10, 2021 I developed an itch over my entire body, it would not stop itching. My right arm starts to get the red itchy rash back when I workout or walk my dog, any time I get my heart rate up. I have to take Benadryl to help the itching go down.   Jan 11-12, 2021 My body is still itchy all over. When I exercise, my right arm gets red and itchy. My neck, throat, face, lips, and ears start to develop red hive-like blotches and they are itchy 20 minutes into my workout. This improves when I am done with my workout.  Jan 13-14, 2021 My face had a red rash over the nose and cheeks. This rash is sensitive to the touch. Jan 15 - Today Jan 16, 2021 The itch is very faint now. The red rash on my face is improving. Otherwise I feel normal.

                                                at around 2am I woke up shaking and extremely cold. Got up and felt severe body aches and rigors. Throughout the day I had persistent fever of up to 101.8F which improved with alternating IBU 800mg and Tylenol 1g, but did not resolve. The severe body pains and headache also lasted all day. Improved but not resolved with medication. My right arm was also severely painful. Could not raise it.  All symptoms resolved by the next morning except for  the arm pain which is much milder, like a 1/10 dull pain but still persistent.

One week and one day after injection (1/19/2021) I developed 6x7inch red swelling, with irregular border at injection site. The area was itchy and very hot to the touch. No pain on palpation and no fever. I also experienced pain under my left arm pit. The next day (1/20/2021) the swelling has gotten larger with same symptoms.

The day after I received the vaccine I had a fluctuating fever of 101 F, body aches, fatigue, chills, nausea, and I vomited once. My arm was also very sore, but there was not swelling or redness at the site of injection. The side effects abated the next day, and I felt completely normal by Monday the 18th.

I began to feel severe flu-like symptoms (hot/cold chills, sensitive skin, headache, dry/scratchy throat, fever dreams) which persisted for several hours during the night. The next day (1/16), the fatigue, headache, and chills persisted (although the chills decreased). I took Dayquil before noon and that seemed to help with the symptoms, and Nyquil at night so I was able to sleep. By the following morning, I still had a mild headache and fatigue but continued to improve. I felt normal again on 1/18.   I also had stiffness, swelling, and soreness at the injection site for 3-4 days.

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

On day 8, it was itchy.  Then, it felt that the knot had enlarged.  It became warm to touch and a little red (not much).  It is not painful like it was after the injection.  It has not resolved, but it just started yesterday.  It is less red today, but it is about the same.

I went into work late and at work I got so dizzy, I saw spots and had to rest my head for 20 minutes. This continued into the evening. If I was moving around too much, I got lightheaded. I have had continuous headaches since the 12 hours after the injection on 1/20. Around 4PM on 1/21, my chest started to feel tight. My chest has continued to feel tight since. Drinking water has seemed to help and I was actually able to sleep through the night last night. The first evening, I woke up every hour or so. Throughout the day on 1/21 I had the chills and hot flashes. I was achy all day. As far as my arm goes, it is a little sore now, but the tetanus shot was worse for soreness. Immediately after the shot, I had a shooting pain/numbness go down my left arm to my fingertips. That went away in a few hours. My shoulder/arm throbbed throughout the first night. I have had little abdominal pain in the evenings before bed.

At this time I took two Tylenol &amp; two Advil with a Ketorolac. The restless leg continued into full body aches, head to toe. Headache to migraine (this varied from on the top of my head to my left temple). These symptoms were consistent throughout the day, with severe fatigue. 1000 of 1/20/21 I was feeling chills and again nausea (again dry heaves). I drank ginger ale for the nausea, but I had no appetite till 1400. 1100 I took four more Tylenol. The aches subsided towards evening, however the headache in my left temple remained for the rest of the night. At 0500 on 1/21/21 I took more Tylenol and woke up later without the headache and body aches. However fatigue did linger with some back pain throughout the day. On the morning of 1/21/21 I did notice a lump and redness at injection site, as well as being painful to the touch.

Disappeared on Sunday and then on Tuesday it returned large, red and hot. Went to the doctor to  be treated and they said I have cellulitis. As the cellulitis my body became itchy. Continued itching all over body while taking the antibiotic, unsure why I am very itchy. The redness is gone from the infection site and now I am experiencing itching on legs, arms, back.

I also felt a little &#34;off&#34; systemically- no fever but I was a bit lethargic and dizzy. I took benadryl (either 25 or 50mg) at night before bed and this did not help the first night, but it helped immensely almost immediately the 2nd night I took it, and then the next morning it had pretty much gone away.

The headache and sore arm worsened and then around 9pm I started with horrible chills and body aches. My symptoms continued onto the next day, including intermittent nausea and extreme fatigue. I had to leave work early on Wednesday 1/20/21, called out of work on 1/21/21. My symptoms were gone by mid day of 1/21/21 except my fatigue and headache lingered until 1/22/21. I took extra strength Tylenol throughout the days.

                                                About 8-10 minutes after the injection, my vision got blurry. It was very brief- only a couple minutes long. If it had lasted until the end of my 15 minute post-injection observation period, I would have reported it then, but it didn&#39;t. I decided to include it here, because later in the day, I had another reaction. About 12 hours after the dose -around 7PM- I started getting chills and body aches and abnormally fatigued. The chills were intense almost as soon as they come on. The body aches were mild for the first couple hours and progressed to intense. Both symptoms lasted continuously for about 12 hours, then around 7AM they started to wane. I&#39;m not sure if I should list insomnia as a reaction, but despite how exhausted I felt, I could not sleep. It could have also been just general discomfort that kept me from being able to sleep. Through most of the following day I had mild aches and waves of chills. By the time I went to bed that night (last night at the time of writing this), the symptoms had mostly  cleared and so far have not returned.

I fainted after trying to sit up, for maybe a few seconds, before coming to. Then proceeded with shaking and cold sweats through the night. Next day is better, but still body aches, fatigue and very small fever of 99.5

                                                Around dinner time I developed fatigue and significant arm pain. By 10pm I had a 101 degree fever, cold sweats, chills, full body aches, and nausea. My fever reduced to 99 degrees around 0730am and remained as such through the following day (1/28/21) as the chills, nausea, and cold sweats gradually faded away. I was deeply fatigued and unable to work.  Sometime mid afternoon I developed a crippling frontal headache That worsened in the light and standing. I have no history of headaches or migraines. I was still repulsed by the thought of eating. I took acetaminophen with a protein shake and it helped the headache And residual body aches enough for me to sleep. 1/29/21 I awoke still fatigued  with a minor headache.   I am a pro athlete with no underlying conditions. I have had my flu shot yearly with no side effects. I am extremely fit and eat a healthy balanced diet, maintain a healthy athletic weight, sleep 7-8 hours a night, do not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use recreational drugs. I was absolutely floored at how sick this shot made me.

                                                Almost immediately my arm was sore (as expected). However, about 7 hours after the shot I developed a fever (101), body aches, weakness, reduced O2 saturation (95-95), tightness in my chest,  fatigue, nausea, and headache. These symptoms were severe and persistent from 8pm 2/19 through overnight on 2/21. I treated it with Extra Strength Tylenol 1,000mg every 6 hours like clockwork, hydration and rest. I slept about 18-20 hours each day (Saturday and Sunday).   I awoke on 2/22 with only fatigue, sporadic tightness in my chest and O2 at 95 remaining. As of today 2/22 at 2:40pm the tightness in my chest has gone and my fatigue is gone. I do not know my O2 saturation right now as I left my reader at home.

Wrse though, was the inability to bend my fingers after they swelled up and had incredibly itchy welts all over. Benadryl did not help0, the itching, soreness, and inability to bend my fingers persisted for approximately 4 days. I had a headache that was severe as well. I made two trips to the emergency room and then followed up with my primary physician.

During 1st 24 hours of having the 2nd dose I had chills, fever, body aches, sleeplessness. Symptoms subsided within 24-48 hours with the arm soreness taking about a week to completely go away.   A week and a half after receiving the 2nd dose I noticed a lump on my neck, lower middle near the collarbone. It is significantly pronounced. I saw my primary doctor for an already scheduled physical and she said I was fighting off an infection and it was normal. I mentioned I had the COVID vaccine and she said it isn&#39;t uncommon to see the lymph node swell after vaccination and it should go away in a couple of weeks. I wanted to report this because it can freak people out to see a lump in their neck so long after being vaccinated without any other symptoms. We need to list this as a possible side effect on the vaccine information. I feel completely fine except my neck is a little tender/sore from the swollen lymph node.

She was sent to Cardiology and they diagnosed her with pericarditis and she was started on scheduled NSAIDS. - Cardiology recommended ESR, CRP and CBC and they were negative. - CXR was normal - Echocardiogram was suggestive of pericarditis. Cardiology told her to follow up in 1 month is symptoms did not improve and they have not. Also she stated she has developed mild, intermittent peripheral edema that resolves without intervention but this is new.  I am also ordering the cardiac MRI which the cardiologist recommended if symptoms did not improve with NSAIDs.

                                                Body aches and chills the following morning after receiving the vaccination.  I was very sluggish and remained in bed for the majority of the day.    I also had a lot of pain at the injection site and couldn&#39;t lift my arm.  Tylenol resolved the issues for the most part but it was only effective for about three hours prompting me to wait an additional 2-3 hours with the symptoms.   This lasted 24 hours and I felt good as new the following day with minor pain at the injection site.

                                                There were no immediate adverse affects after the vaccine. Arm tenderness near the injection site became very noticeable the morning after the shot. About a day after the vaccine, I developed flu-like symptoms: joint tenderness, body aches, chills, and a low-grade fever of 99 - 100.1 degrees. These symptoms were completely gone within 48 hrs. I experienced moderate to severe arm tenderness for 3-4 days. I also had slight periods of itchiness near the site of injection, but again, this dissipated completely after 3-4 days.

Took symbicort (I have normally well controlled asthma). Called clinic and was advised that I was fine and could continue to work and to follow up with MD if symptoms got worse. Did virtual visit with Pulmonologist at 0945 and he advised me to get COVID swabbed and prescribed prednisone taper and albuterol MDI. COVID swabbed 2/9 at 5pm. Out of work 2/10 &amp; 2/11 awaiting test results. Returned to work 2/12 after negative COVID result- passed safepass- worked, still SOB, but manageable. 2/13-2/14 had increasing SOB- albuterol MDI 6x/day. Monday 2/15 returned to work- saw doctor in person- increased prednisone from 20mg (tapered down) to 40mg (original dose) and added Spiriva. 2/17- Went to ED for status asthmaticus after using albuterol MDI 5-6x/day without any relief. Admitted 2/17 for asthma exacerbation- discharged 2/20. Discharged home with nebulized albuterol, prednisone slow taper, symbicort, Spiriva, Singulair &amp; Claritin. 2/23-2/24 Albuterol nebs 5x/day, still SOB. Pulmonary visit 2/24 - added inhaled budesonide nebs. Out of work 2/25-2/26. Returned to work 3/1- finally feeling better!

The fever and body aches just lasted to Friday. Saturday, I still had the rash area on my arm and it got bigger.  Saturday   - Telehealth visit. Rash on arm took five days to go away. Told me to put a  hot compress on it if I wanted to but no other advice given. Pregnancy - February 12 - Preeclampsia was diagnosed. I was induced that day so baby was a week early -. February 20 had been estimated due date. This was my first pregnancy. I got COVID when I was pregnant in October. I was hospitalized with the heart rate issue that they thought occurred because of COVID November 16-19th. I have a healthy baby girl!

When it continued to get worse, I went to the dr about 3 weeks after my first shot and was diagnosed with labyrinthitis. My symptoms continued to worsen, and I now have severe hearing loss as well as 75% loss of vestibular function (diagnosed by ENT and audiologist) with constant vertigo. My current diagnosis is labyrinthitis, however I&#39;m also getting an MRI in 2 days to rule out other possibilities.

                                                Felt lightheaded for a few seconds and then went into an arrhythmia leading to ventricular Fibrillation . Was shocked my by subcutaneous-ICD. Went into the ER and was admitted to the hospital for monitoring. Doctors changed medication to an antiarrythmic beta blocker, Sotalol (80mg 2x/day). Still being monitored in the hospital to make sure that I tolerate the drug.   I had not had a cardiac event since by initial one in March 2019.

I felt a pounding in my chest. It felt difficult to talk to due tingling of the tongue.  I took Benadryl 25 mg PO 30 minutes prior to vaccine due to history of anaphylaxis with shell fish.

                                                I received the vaccine on December 29th, 2020. The vaccinated arm didn&#39;t really hurt until the next morning when I woke up I could barely move my arm.  Around 10:00am  I started getting chills and having sweats. Over the next hour I became severely fatigued even with taking my adderall that morning. My body started tingling, I felt dissociated, had a headache, and a little light headed. Almost a little drunk feeling. I went home from work and slept most of the day.  When I woke up in the evening around 9pm I was sweaty, and my muscles and joints hurt. I took my temperature and it was  100.6.  The next morning on December 31st I no longer had a fever. My temperature was 98. something. The next several days and even now I continue to feel severely fatigued, and slightly dissociated. However, each day I seem to feel the side effects a little less.

She had significant pain after receiving the vaccine which resolved in a day or two. She was unable to move the arm the evening after receiving the vaccine (feeling completely asleep), but has gained full strength. She continues to have paresthesias (like the arm feeling asleep or bugs crawling) to the forearm and her entire hand. She did take diphenhdyramine and isn&#39;t certain if it improved the paresthesias, but it did make her fall asleep. Two to three days ago (about 6 days after receiving the vaccine), she developed a cellulitis about 5 cm distal to the vaccine site without systemic symptoms for clinically apparent abscess.

                                                I developed a moderately severe headache, body aches, fatigue and nausea within a few hours of the vaccine. These symptoms persisted into the next day, but had decreased in severity after about 24 hours. I still had a mild headache and body aches (specifically back, neck, and R shoulder pain) the next two days. Three days after, I started feeling worse. The headache again became moderately severe, as well as the neck and back pain,  fatigue and nausea.  This has continued through today (day 8 post-vaccine).  I still have a moderately severe constant headache (dull with throbbing with exertion or movement in neck), back and neck pain and stiffness, mild nausea, and fatigue.

                                                Sore arm, body aches after day 2 of getting vaccinated, which was to be expected. I was concerned about last night on 1/6/21, where my L arm became extremely itchy, swollen and broke out in hives. Today, remains extremely itchy, swollen/raised and there is a red square over the injection site. The area of redness and swelling measures to be 3 inches by 3 1/2 inches and does not appear to be getting any larger as the day goes on. I did take 12.5 mg of benadryl, which has resolved some of the itching.

                                                After receiving the vaccine on 12/30 the only side effect at that time was arm soreness at the injection site. A day later some chills and fatigue but no other side effects after. I noticed starting on 1/4 pain started on injection arm from shoulder down lower to extremities on left arm. Pain very excruciating but comes and goes. Joint pain and muscular pain throughout entire arm and even in right arm. After couple days of this,  contacted family physician regarding this.  Was seen by physician on 1/6. Discuss concerned and he ordered X-rays on both arms and ultrasound droplet on entire left arm (injection site- from shoulder in down). MD also I formed me to take Advil/Aleve twice a day as needed for pain/soreness along with heat/cool compressions as needed as well as shoulder exercises. Today is 1/9 and pain isn?t as bad. Can still feel discomfort here and there but not as excruciating. Numbness from time to time also. Is this normal after receiving the Moderna vaccine? Is it normal to experience this a week after receiving the vaccine?

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post injection, I felt a burning sensation move from my left deltoid, up my shoulder, and across my chest. I experienced burning in my chest for about 10 mins, and then it subsided. About 8 mins after that, I experienced moderate to severe cramping in my lower back and thigh muscles; which completely subsided after 10-15 mins. Two days after the initial injection, the injection site began burning/aching again, with movement up to my shoulder joint. It was to a point where I was tearful and unable to sleep. The following morning it had subsided, and just remains slightly sore.

                                                Arm was bruised and tender to the touch approximately 3-4 hours following vaccine. Started feeling dizzy around 8pm on 1/7/21.  Took PM meds and went to bed. Awoke around 3am with a temp of 103, joint aches, muscle aches, chills, congestion, eyes very dry and itchy,  severe headache/migraine with photosensitivity, fatigue on 1/8/21. Left arm was swollen, hot to the touch and very tender to move it. Took Tylenol and Benadryl to help relieve symptoms. Put a heating pad on injection site. Felt about the same all day so I rested. Went to bed around 10pm on 1/8/21. Woke up around 4am on 1/9/21 and my temp was 99.7 prior to taking any meds and after about 20 minutes of being out of bed. On 1/9/21 I still have arm tenderness and bruising, fatigue, headache, left eye redness to upper eyelid with swelling, temp has been running at 99.7 and it?s currently 4pm EST.

PCP states type Iv allergic reaction. Area is around 3inch by 3 inch.   Initially on day of vaccine I did have redness and pain at injection site but it subsided within 72 hours. During first 72 hours, I also had headache and fatigue.

After that I was not having symptoms but one week later I got a late reaction at the site of injection. It is swollen red hard and itchy and inflamed. So I went to Dr. and she has suggested me to take Motrin and use cold ice pack. So I took a Motrin yesterday and today. I had a reaction where I had BCG vaccination in the childhood.

                                                Vaccine administered around 5:30pm Thursday, January 7th. Severe site pain within the first few hours of receiving vaccine, lasting about 48 straight hours. Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine, my entire body began to ache and by the next morning I could hardly get out of bed due to the pain in my muscles. They felt like they had tightened or seized up. I could not take a step without wincing. Body chills came next, though I was unable to get out of bed to get my  thermometer from the bathroom. By Saturday morning, I had more range of motion in my extremities, but it was not until Sunday evening that I could lift my left arm (the one the received the inoculation) over my head. There was a red, circular non-irritating rash surrounding the site of injection for 5 days following injection. I have no allergies to any medications, but did test positive for the Covid virus on March 18th, 2020. I realize my body&#39;s reaction was a normal physiologic response to the antibodies my body created within the last 9 months, however I am an otherwise healthy 34 year old female and wanted to report my experience because I could not find evidence that anyone else has had the same experience following the first dose of the covid vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  I began feeling an increase in heart rate about 5-8 minutes after injection. I reported symptoms and site began to monitor my pulse, which was 160. I then drank 32oz of water and took 400mg ibuprofen. I then began to feel dizziness. Blood pressure was normal. My chair was reclined and I was given about 2oz of orange juice. I was then moved to a stretcher and my legs were elevated on a chair. I took a restroom break. I began by walking, but started to see spots in my vision and sat in a wheelchair. I was able to use the restroom and return to stretcher and elevation of my legs. I was then taken to the ER. I used the restroom once more independently. Blood sample was taken. Heart rate was  160, blood pressure was normal. EKG was abnormal and I was given dosage of adenosine. First dose did not show necessary improvement and I was given a second dose, which dropped my heart rate to the 90s. I used the restroom independently and was given an additional EKG, which was normal. During this time my Physician contacted a Cardiologist, for consultation. I was then discharged with recommendation to follow up with cardiologist in 2-4 days.

                                                Approximately 7 minutes after vaccination I became lightheaded and dizzy. Felt like fainting. Heart rate jumped up to 179 BPM using a pulse oximeter to read and was breathing heavily. Was assisted to a wheelchair and spent a few minutes breathing in through my nose and out through my mouth and after a few minutes of this, my heart rate went back down and the symptoms subsided. As of today (1/27/2021) I am very exhausted.

I understand that these were expected with the second dose. However at 9:40am I began vomiting. By 11am my throat started to close so I went to the ER. I had a minor asthma attack while I was there (coughing fit and slight wheezing). I was evaluated and they gave me IV fluids as well as other medications through the IV. I received solu-medrol, Benadryl, antacid, and anti-nausea. They took blood tests, urinalysis, and chest x-ray, all of which were normal. I did not have a rash around the injection site this time. I was discharged at about 3:10pm

                                                I was experiencing what I understand to be one of the more common side effects: pain at injection site. This pain kind of traveled to other parts of my arm and eventually my arm pit. I noticed the pain travelling around the date of 1/2/2021, and by 1/6/2021 it getting more intense. As I was trying to massage out the soreness, I noticed a palpable, painful lump in my right breast. I did not immediately recognize it as a swollen lymph node at that time, but after several Dr exams, and the lump and pain decreasing, I believe that is what was happening. I do still have the lump, and it is tender, so I am currently monitoring it.

                                                Initially, arm was sore and inflamed for about 4 days. I did not notice condition afterwards because pain had subsided. Approximately 8 days after shot, arm started to itch and I examined further. It was still very red and inflamed with knots under the skin. An area approximately 2&#34; x6&#34;. I started to keep a closer eye on it and when it was not better the next day, I contacted my doctors office in the building where I received the shot. The nurse who responded had me photograph it and continue to monitor until the doctor could look at it on Monday (this being Friday afternoon). Friday evening I outlined the affected area with marker to see if it was worsening or maintaining the same level. By Saturday morning it had grown outside the marked line by about an inch, was warm to the touch, and was starting to hurt. I decided to not wait until Monday and called an urgent care to go doctor to look at. They examined and read temperature (head was 97.2, arm was 99.5). After consideration the doctor advised me to take benadryl that evening to see if it had any effect. If not I was presribed Cefdinir 300mg antibiotic to take in the morning. Benadryl did nothing so I started taking the antibiotic and noticed marked improvement by day 2. Site is mostly gone now (4 days into 10 day antibiotic cycle).

Next day the pain has spread to my neck and ear. On day number three they felt numb, day number four lots of pain on my jaw. Day number 5 I couldn&#39;t even swallow and had difficulty breathing. When I looked in the mirror the left side of my face was very swollen like a ball and my face looked like it was paralyzed. I went to the ER where I was seen, but it remains the same days afterwards. My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

                                                About 15 minutes later - body felt like it was on fire; shortness of breath; heart rate was pounding very fast. I stayed in an observation room for about 3 hours. Next day, I couldn&#39;t feel my right arm. I started getting fever, chills. I had all symptoms of the coronavirus. Saturday at 03:00 am - I woke up and I couldn&#39;t feel my arm or my fingers on my right side. I called the Emergency number. I stayed home and took Tylenol. Couldn&#39;t feel my arm at all that Saturday - dead. Sunday - same thing. Monday morning, I woke up, I could feel a little bit of my fingers but I noticed that I had blisters full of blood between your index finger and your thumb. I didn&#39;t go to work that day. The doctor wrote me out of work for the rest of the week. I didn&#39;t have any sensation on my pinkie or ring finger. I had a little bit of sensation on the rest of my fingers. I stayed at home and I didn&#39;t do anything with my arm and it slowly started getting better. That whole week I was having symptoms that were just like coronavirus. They came and went. the following Saturday, I started being able to move my arm around and doing more stuff and slowly it came back but I&#39;m not 100%. I can&#39;t lay on the right hand side too long - it starts feeling like my arm is asleep. I got the second dose February 12th.  I spoke to an allergy doctor and an anesthesiology doctor (video and telephone visits) - they told me I was having common side affects that people were having from the vaccine but they didn&#39;t know why.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

The following day woke up at 6am with chest pain, described as mild to moderate in severity with no radiation.

                                                Immediately following vaccine I experienced expected muscle soreness in affected arm.  Symptoms resolved by 12/31 (day 3). On 01/02/21 in the evening I began to experience tenderness in my underarm arm of my left arm.  about 24 hours later 01/03/21in the evening I continued to experience pain which began spreading to front and back shoulder. Pain extended down my left arm when reaching/extending arm.  Upon rising 01/04/21 swelling in underarm included lump approximately size of mandarin, swolling noted in left bicep. Aching in arm, pain continued to extend down arm.  Other symptoms included malaise, sore throat, nasal congestion, mild headache.  reported to employee health line, asked to receive COIVD test, informed to follow up with PCP regarding arm symptoms as &#34;after 72 hours this is not considered side effects from the vaccine&#34;. PCP referred to respiratory clinic  to f/u to monitor swelling/pain.  Provider ordered ultrasound for underarm lump/swelling thought to be in response to COVID vaccine also to view veins in left arm due to my history of DVT.  currently awaiting ultrasound appointment for additional information.

On 1/2/21, my right foot and leg were fine and pain has not returned since then. My left foot, ankle, and shin hurt pain level 2 of 10 on and off all day. Same on 1/3/21. On 1/4/21 the left leg, ankle, and foot hurt 7 of 10. Same on 15/2021. The pain seems to be moving upwards, almost to my knee at times. The pain is usually an ache all over the left food, ankle, shin. Sometimes I get sharp jabs of pain while sitting or walking. Aleve sometimes helps. Heat pad made it worse. Cold pad made it a little better.

                                                Shortness of breath started on Wednesday afternoon.  Right deltoid slightly swollen, no rash present at that time.  Short of breath with no activity.  Muscle aches, fatigue, just felt off.  Then arm was very sore.  Sunday night my arm pit really started hurting.  Hurst over my shoulder, clavicle, and down into the lateral side of my breast.  Bothered enough in the night that I didn&#39;t sleep well.  This morning 1-5-21 I have a red rash over the injection site, arm is swollen over deltoid and hot.  Arm pit and down into breast is still hurting significantly.  I took Ibuprofen yesterday and helped some with pain in arm pit.  Off an on SOB and chest feels tight.  No cough

                                                12 days following the vaccine administration I noticed redness on my arm around the injection site. This redness was hot to the touch and rather large, exceeding the deltoid muscle and going down into my bicep. I also felt radiating soreness into my armpit and left breast.  The following day the rash had grown in size and felt hot to the touch on my entire upper arm with swelling and edema that affected the movement of my arm and hand. Continued soreness and pain in my armpit, left breast and down my arm into my fingers and up into my neck.  I proceeded to go to the urgent care as directed by Clinic employee health and my PCP. There was I was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescriped Keflex for 7 days, 3x a day.  It has been recommended that I seek further medical care due to my reaction, but this has yet to be scheduled.

                                                I received the moderna covid vaccine at approx 0930 and waited in waiting room of facility per policy after injection.  I felt ok once wait time was up so I left.  I was driving approx 15 min later and (which was approx 30) after administration and pulled over to side of road due to getting chills and shaking and feeling faint.  Also, the left side of my face went numb and tingling.   I called for an ambulance and once they arrived I had started feeling normal again.  Facial tingling still persists at this time hours later.  I also had another sync opal episode once I got a ride home that resolved.  Left side of face feels like after being numb from a dentist.

Dry cough developed as well at that time. Through the day severe body aches, fatigue and fever/chills developed and progressed. I was unable to sleep as a result. Today severs body aches and fever/chills continue as well as headache that does not resemble the chronic migraines I normally have. Tightness in chest and dry, nonproductive cough continue as well. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue. Injection site is hot, red, and raised- pain with left arm movement as a result.

                                                At 8:35 AM on 1/6/2021, I noticed redness and swelling on my upper left arm as I removed my long-sleeve shirt.   I also noticed that my upper left arm was slightly warm after touching it.  This is the first time I have experienced redness, swelling and warmth on the injection site.  After I got my first dose of the COVID19 (Moderna) vaccine, I experienced mild pain, soreness and muscular/body aches for several days.  I longer experienced these particular symptoms on 1/5/2021.  To treat the redness and swelling, I took one 25 mg tablet of Diphenhydramine HCl at approximately 10:00 AM.  I went to bed 50 minutes later.   I woke up at approximately 6:50 PM.  I checked my upper left arm and saw that the redness and swelling went down.  However, my upper left arm still feels slightly warm.  I will continue to monitor my current symptoms for the next few days.

                                                Immediately following shot, I had soreness in my arm that gradually worsened throughout the day. Around 8 pm the pain radiated up my shoulder across the top of my back. Around 10 pm I was suddenly hit with a wave of fatigue where my husband was unable to wake me from the couch to go to bed.  I woke up around 8:30 am on 1/7/21 with a debilitating headache, tingling in my fingertips,  and unsteadiness while walking. I was advised to go to the ED who gave no treatment other than recommending OTC pain meds, benedryl and rest. I returned home and took all the recommendations. At 4:41 pm, there has been no change with symptoms.

Never did I develop a temperature. This continued until 12/26/2020 when the symptoms dissipated. 1/5/2021 @ 0600: I woke up to my right arm feeling sore and area where I had received the vaccine was warm and a thin red circular outline could be seen. Also note that a few months ago I had injections in my legs due to vein insufficiency. Interestingly enough, during the same time frames, when my arm would become red and painful, so would my right knee.

                                                After receiving the shot,  I experienced a sharp pain in my shoulder and neck on the left side (same side as the shot was received).  This only lasted a couple of minutes and then I felt normal.  That evening the area where I received the shot was sore and hard to lift.  This is when I started to notice stiffness in my left elbow joint and muscle aches throughout my body.  Upon waking the following morning,  the stiffness in my elbow joint had increase and it made it difficult to bend my elbow.  At this point,  I had assumed that maybe I had pulled something or slept on it wrong.  I figured it would work itself out in a day or two.  This has not been the case.  It is now day 8,  my elbow joint is stiff with soreness and pain in the surrounding area.  I am not able to lift items as I normally would or squeeze/hold items in my  left hand without experiencing pain in that elbow or the surround muscles.  It had been uncomfortable and painful to move and bend that arm and even the simple act of straightening the elbow is difficult to accomplish.  All pain and discomfort is limited to the elbow joint and surrounding area.

I?m also experiencing mild axillary tenderness. It is looking better today but I thought it was strange that those side effects took more than a week to show up. I did experience some pain for 3 days after the injection but it had completely resolved and my arm was looking totally normal until yesterday evening

My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

I never even felt it coming on, I just remember waking up. I looked at the clock at 4:46am. It seemed like a very long time to be out.

Today, Monday 1/11/21, I am still exhausted and light headed but not as nauseas.

Through the morning noted the hives spread up my neck and angioedema noted to both sides of my neck, lymph nodes swelling on both sides and the injection site became more swollen and turned very hard to the touch.  No difficulty breathing at baseline, but it becamer difficult to take a full breath and chest tightness with exertion.  Benadryl 50 mg was taken 4-6 times a day for 3 days.  PA consulted, who stated to stay with Benadryl regimen, steroids not currently recommended, call 911 if symptom worsen.

Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

                                                Day of shot had pretty extreme pain in the arm a few hours later into the night. Was pretty extreme next day - couldn?t move arm above head, hard to change in and out of clothes, etc. Following day still pain but maybe 10%better. Over weekend slowly got better. This Monday and Tuesday woke up with very slight pain but nothing that I had to adjust my everyday routine for like a I had the first few days so I thought I was in the clear. Then last night extreme pain back again. Can?t move arm/shoulder without pain. Can?t engage muscle without a lot of pain.

                                                During the 15min observation period, I felt flush for about a minute. I felt super hot, but it subsided. The biggest issue was the injection site. It was a huge, super hot, golf ball size welt on my arm. It spent two days growing bigger. The fourth day it began to feel better. I also had muscle stiffness, body and body aches lasting about 2-3 days.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after vaccination, I developed generalized malaise with significant pain in right arm (injection site), neck and back.  Over the subsequent 2-4  hours, I developed fever to 102.5 with shaking chills with ongoing myalgias and arthralgias (knees, hips).  I took some acetaminophen and fever eventually broke.  Still feeling weak, achy and fatigued but better.

                                                As the injection day wore on, my arm increased in soreness. By 9:00 pm on day of injection, I was unable to lift or move my arm, due to the pain. For 2 days after the injection, I was unable to perform many activities becuase I could not lift or move my arm. By 11:30 pm on Saturday 1/16, I started to be able to lift and move my arm, a tiny bit. On Sunday the 17th, I was able to lift my arm to shoulder height, but still had a great deal of pain. The pain started to lessen throughout the day on Sunday. When I woke up Monday morning, I was able to use my arm, but it felt &#34;dead&#34; (like when you sleep on a limb wrong). This feeling continued through Tuesday, and Tuesday evening. Tuesday evening, into Wednesday the 20th, it feels like there is a tennis ball in my arm pit - when my arm is in normal position. When my axillary lymph nodes were felt, there is no swelling, but a greater amount of pain.

Resolved gradually on its own after 2 days.

She tried pressing down and stretching the fingers to no avail. 12:40 she was asked to accompany this writer to another observation area for closer monitoring. When she stood up from the chair, she was frozen and unable to move her left leg on command and needed physical assistance from this writer to ambulate.  She became weak and needed the assistance of another nurse to  be laid on the stretcher.  VS were taken 98/64,117,22.  (VS prior to administration of the vaccine  124/89,130,18.     At this time we offered to send her to ED for further evaluation but staff declined stating, &#34;this has happened before, it will go away&#34;.   It was agreed upon that if symptoms worsened or showed no improvement in 5 minutes EMS would be activated.  12:50 VS 130/83,89 , tremors dissipating, fingers back in normal position , she was able to move her left leg on command and stand unassisted.

Normal treatment that works for me( rizatroban) only slightly lessened. Advil Tylenol alternated for migraine and chills. Arm much less sore this time. I would say normal injection soreness.  But stayed in bed all day due to migraine, chills and fatigue. No way I could have worked. 36hrs- woke up feeling really foggy and some dizziness.  After drinking a few glasses of water feeling somewhat normal.  No fatigue today, arm feeling almost normal.

When I got home from work, I noticed what looked like 3 round/oval shaped redness and swelling spots that were warm to touch on my arm, I applied Benadryl cream and that helped decrease. The next day the three spots had became one and was the size of a tennis ball; it was red, a little swollen and warm to touch. The following day (today 01/24/2021) the the redness and swelling had grown about 6 inches wide and 5 inches in height; I took Benadryl 25 mg po and within 30 minutes then swelling and redness had began to decrease, warm to touch was still there and it began to get a little itchy but very manageable, I applied benadryl cream and that seemed to help a little, but when cream wore off it began to get a little itchy, but still very manageable; I did not reapply the cream.  No pain or discomfort at the area of concern on any days above.

                                                The day of my 2nd vaccination, I felt a heavy pressure being forced down on myself. It started as a weakness that begun in my left arm. I felt I had unequal strength and my arm felt numb. This begun minutes after my injection. Soon after the sensation went to my whole body. I had difficulty moving from the chair to a wheelchair. I was moved to a treatment bed and layer down in the supine position. I felt extremely weak and hot. After an hour I was released home. The evening of my injection, I started to become extremely tired. My appetite disappeared and all I wanted to do was go to bed. While sleeping I was awoken due to an heating issue inside the home.  I woke up, tried to eat something, but had no desire to. I went back to bed, after taking some Tylenol. My body was starting to ache. While in bed, I begun to experience severe muscle spasms, cramps, etc. These caused me to cry. I began experience extreme changes in temperature. I went from hot to cold quickly. My mouth became very dry, and the weakness persisted. I began to experience severe pain at the injection site that radiated down into my armpit and left breast and my left shoulder blade. I could barely lift my arm. It feels as though the muscle is very ridge, hard and I have point tenderness. I continued to experience severe fatigue and after waking up this morning around 10am or so, I felt extremely hot. My temperature is reading 100.1 Tympanic. I&#39;ve taken Motrin this time as I have been alternating between the two pain relievers.

Oxygen fine the whole time; heart rate regulated after the beginning and no fever - feeling a bit better within 1 hour. Headache started that night and lasted until midnight the next day. Very tired the whole next day until about 5:30pm.

                                                approximately 45- an hour after the injection I had some rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

                                                About 3 hours after the injection, I was hit all of a sudden with extreme fatigue and dizziness. This lasted several hours until a took a 2-3 hour nap after lunch. I felt better enough after the nap to at least get through the rest of the day. However, by around 8 pm I had uncontrollable shaking chills. Could not get warm. Eventually fell asleep, and woke up 3 hours later with fever and severe body aches. My temperature was 101.5, but consider that my normal body temp is a full degree lower than average, so for me this was extremely hot. I felt like my body was radiating heat like a furnace. I was so hot and uncomfortable that I couldn&#39;t sleep, and gave up after an hour. I got up and had a Tylenol, tea, and snack (so as to not have the Tylenol on empty stomach). A little before 4 am I finally fell asleep again. When I woke up around 7 am, I didn&#39;t feel quite so hot anymore but there were still the body aches. As the morning went on, the aches reduced to just my upper body, neck, and the sore injection arm. I had a headache through the morning and early afternoon, but by late afternoon I was feeling more normal again.

                                                Around lunch time on the 9th of Jan . I noticed all over body rash, macular papular rash redish whitish throughout body, it became very itchy in my arms and legs, I noticed numbness in right and left arm and legs numbness, shooting pain in left side as well, I experienced neurological symptoms and went to ER. They did a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, they said it was probably a immune response and was told to take antihistamines at home. symptoms started to subside after a couple of days, I then developed intermittent chest pains in the left side and the pain became more consistent and then a week later it was consistent with every breath and I went to the ER again, they did an EKG, Troponin, all cadiac workup and chest xray said it was not cardiac but possibly a chest wall issue, I was referred to cardiology, cardiologist thought I may have pericarditis, I started taking 800mg of ibuprofen for management. My pain has began to subside and now I only have a couple of minutes every other day that I still have pain but stopped taking medication the third week in February. Because of the intensity of my immune response they recommended I not take the 2nd dose. If symptoms subside I will let my dr know

My fever peaked at 101.2 at 2am. Pain relievers and fever reducers did not help. I had cold sweats throughout the night, not able to sleep consistently through the night due to body aches, headache and nausea. Left arm became swollen, hot and hard to the touch, this lasted through 2/17/21. The arm was itchy from 2/18-2/20/21. The fever and body aches lasted through 2/16 until about 10:15pm, around 11:00pm the headache went away. I was feeling mostly recovered with the exception of the arm by the morning of 2/17.

                                                I started having minor body aches about six hours post vaccine. I woke up that night nauseous and dizzy. I passed out on the way to the kitchen to get water. My husband somehow heard me and helped me back to the bedroom where I passed out again. I was eventually able to get back in bed without passing out, though I couldn&#39;t get warm and had severe body aches for most of the night. It was like having a very high fever, only there was no fever. I was clammy, but no fever. Around 4:30 a.m. the &#39;non-fever&#39; broke and the chills and body aches stopped. I was extremely fatigued for the next two days and felt myself again by the third. The arm in which I received the shot hurt pretty bad Friday too but that was the least of my concerns.   I did not seek medical treatment for these symptoms.

She states that over the weekend it has gotten larger and is estimating that it is 3.5&#34;x2&#34; in size this morning.  She feels like it is a bit warm to the touch, but is not painful and denies any pruritus. She does think that her arm is a &#34;bit more swollen&#34; then her other, but not significant.  Initially after the vaccine she did not have any other symptoms than a &#34;typical&#34; sore arm for 2 days. Instructed the employee to take a 2nd generation antihistamine, and to use NSAIDs and ICE to manage symptoms.

She has photos on her phone. Right hand felt numb. Interestingly, the symptoms spared approximately 10 cm around the injection site. She had mild joint diffusely. No fever but had chills. She took 25 mg of Benadryl and her symptoms significantly improved after about an hour.

It was a raised area that was red and hot in a circular shape that was 4 inches across. Remained this was until 1/5/2021. It was painful to move the arm (2/10). I used Tylenol for discomfort and ice to the site. Helped some.

I felt like my heart rate has been rapid all day and my rate of breathing has been slightly increased. The pain in my left arm, where I was given the injection is very sore to the point where it is difficult to lift or to touch. I was too weak to attempt to go to follow up with medical professionals today and opted to wait to see if symptoms resolved.

I wasn&#39;t worried because this is well known for side effects from the vaccine but I wasn&#39;t prepared for the heart palpitations and tachycardia I had for about 4 hours the night of 1/5/21. I had COVID in May 2020 and per my cardiologist probably had myocarditis that I am still taking a beta blocker for as a result of the COVID infection. There may or may not be a link between the immune response to the vaccine and my previous COVID complications. The morning of 1/6/21, I am pretty much back to normal.

Immediately following the vaccine I had mild / moderate pain at injection site and muscle soreness at injection site. Roughly 20-24 hours after receiving  the vaccine, I developed moderate headache, fatigue, fogginess, full body aches, nausea and upset stomach. I continued on Tylenol twice daily. After a good night?s sleep, I felt better the following morning and all symptoms had resolved within 48 hours post vaccination.

I went to my gynecologist , first thinking I may have a yeast infection but she did not see a rash and couldn&#39;t diagnose me. She told me that my pain was probably neurological. She took my blood and sent it to a lab for possible yeast infection and STDs. She prescribed me Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Diporopionate 1%. I went to my PCP on Wednesday because the burning intensified and I thought that I may have shingles. I have a stuffy nose and my sense of smell isn&#39;t very good right now. My PCP gave me a Covid test and told me that she can not test me for shingles because I do not have a rash. She did prescribed me Gabapentin 100mg . I am awaiting Covid test and Lab results

                                                Upon vaccination, I had mild soreness in my right arm muscle on day 1 and day 2 (I have been reporting to the VSafe app). There were NO other symptoms or side effects including NO redness, lump/swelling, itching, etc.  I felt fine. I woke up Wednesday, January 6th at 8am  to some itching on my injection site. When lifting my shirt to look at it, I found a quarter sized, red swollen lump that was a little sore and hot to touch.  I contacted my hospital employee COVID phone hotline and spoke with a nurse who transferred me to a doctor (11am) I sent a photo and described my arm. Dr. stated that it was unlikely an allergic reaction due to it being 1 week later. She diagnosed me with cellulitis and started me on Bactrim antibiotic. I took my first dose at 8pm on 1/6 and at 2:30am I woke up with stomach cramps and diarrhea. I woke up again on 1/7 with an elevated temperature at 99 and feeling nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, slight body aches and a large, red hot touch spot on my left ankle (I had a spider bite on my left ankle in Sept 2020 that was treated with Bactrim it healed no issues but this flare up occurred same spot). I continued to take the Bactrim (3 pills total since receiving the rx) and still felt sick. I spoke again with a new COVID hotline doctor on the phone APRN CNP who stated she believes I in fact do not have cellutitis but rather an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine and therefore I should cease taking the Bactrim and start Benadryl. I did that at 7pm 1/7 went to bed woke up and my ankle was better as was my arm although you can still see the circle. I followed up on 1/8 with APRN CNP via secure messaging with photos and she stated again I likely am allergic and to monitor.

Also states that she had sensation of feeling &#34;off balance&#34;. This did not get worse with change in position or head movement. It progressed to feeling &#34;shaky&#34;.  VS were obtained and were HR of 68 and regular, BP of 134/82, RR of 14. Pupils PERL with normal EOM. Good tactile sensation bilaterally. Moving extremities with purpose. Skin color was initially normal but became pale while feeling shaky.  Patient was placed in a near supine position in her vehicle and was observed 1:1. She was given apple juice which improved her shakiness and she regained color in face. She was able to get out of vehicle and ambulate without assistance with a steady, independent gait. She stated that she was back to her baseline before leaving.

                                                At the time of injection no issues other than sore arm. Day 9 post injection developed significant swelling, redness, warmth, and rash like irritation in left arm. Over the past 5 days there has been some decrease in swelling but the redness has formed a circle and has flare ups of rash, warm, and irritation. I have been taking benadyl, zyrtec, and cortisone cream to try and relieve symptoms.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

                                                Two days after my vaccine I noticed some pain in my low back and in my left hand and left foot. I also had one night where I woke up and had soaked through my blankets with sweat. Otherwise, felt fine. On January 7th I noticed that the injection site was suddenly very red and swollen and a dull ache had returned. On the 8th the redness was more filled in and less bright, still swollen and painful. I tried to go paddle boarding and all of my muscles were very weak and I got dizzy and nauseated. I felt like my body was full of lactic acid and that my muscles would not work properly. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and 50mg of Benadryl and got in bed and slept. On the 9th, the redness was almost gone, swelling still visible and muscles very weak, along with a strange tight feeling in my neck and head. My left toes went totally numb. I mainly stayed in bed and slept until the 12th when a precautionary COVID test was negative and I was able to get lab work drawn. I tried biking 2 blocks and felt that my muscles were a little stronger, however my joints felt very fragile and I was short of breath. On the 13th I got some tingling in my left foot and toes went completely numb on 2 occasions. Today, (14th) I do not have the lactic acid feel, however I am very tired and continue to have the head and neck tightness.

Other symptoms: About 10 minutes after vaccination became very hot/flushed. Nurse decided to monitor me for 30 minutes. Severe headache day after vaccination Nauseous day after vaccination  Extremely sore arm for about a week

                                                there was bleeding at the injection site more than from a typical vaccination I have recieved in the past. I sat to wait and within five minutes was lightheaded, overheated but having chills and having intense abdominal cramps. My pulse ox and bpm were fine but my blood pressure was low for me; normal is 110/70 and emt&#39;s confirmed that I was 90/60 and then 98/62 after 40 minutes post vaccine.  I waited longer and then not feeling worse left. Advil fixed the cramps. So far it&#39;s only been pain at the injection site.

As the night progressed my shoulder pain intensified and then  I started to feel pain all over my by body mainly in the joints. It was very severe joint pain all over and especially in my right shoulder that I took another bath.  I couldn?t lay down or sleep I could barely walk around my bedroom but even that hurt so bad in my hips and knees. This feeling was very similar as if I were to having an lupus episode in my joints. Around 4 am on January 14th I finally took ibuprofen and eventually I was able to fall asleep. I later woke up around 9 am and thankfully pain free other than a mild shoulder pain where I got my vaccine.

Redness, swelling, pain at the injection site, stiff arm, slightly elevated temperature (no true fever), aches, and fatigue. Most resolved within 2-3 days.  I was vaccinated 9 days ago, and the following symptoms persist: redness and itching at the vaccination site and a hard lump at the vaccination site. Despite being expected reactions, The concern is their persistence so long after the 1st vaccination. I have not yet received a 2nd dose.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins sitting after infection. I left and was driving and started feeling disoriented, dizzy, shaking and throbbing headache. I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

Metallic taste in back of throat that started within the first half hour and lasted until the next day. Muscle cramps and spasms throughout the first night from feet up to neck.

Extreme fatigue, light headed, nausea started about 24 hours later and still experiencing two days later. (feels like a bad flu without the congestion or cough)

Then on 1/21/2021 the injection site sore when I woke up, was swollen, red, and I had an achy body/chills.   I took Tylenol for the achy body and that has helped, but the injection site on 1/22/2021 still is very sore, red, swollen, and it looks like I?m having a slight allergic reaction with hives around the injection site. Nothing major just unusual since after I got the vaccine the soreness only lasted a couple days, then it returned almost a week later more sore/red/swollen than when I first was vaccinated.

                                                Since receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 12/30/2020 I have been experiencing what almost feels like brain fog. I have had some trouble staying on task at work, trouble finding words, remembering common last names, etc. Oftentimes I will have this temporarily as a migraine aura, but it typically goes away once the migraine comes and goes. This seems to have come to stay since receiving the vaccine. I did have fatigue for approximately 3 days after the vaccine administration - 2-3 hour naps daily. This has improved some. I also had a dull headache that seemed to be there daily for approximately 2.5 weeks post vaccine- nothing I could not tolerate but it just did not want to go away even with my usual treatment - Excedrin Headache and ice.  The best way I can describe it is a dull pain all over the top of my head and forehead. I did have one headache that occurred approximately 5 days after the vaccine, that I would consider a &#34;bad migraine&#34; (Migraine that rendered me incapable of completing my daily routine - having to stay in bed, dizziness, etc). My face on the side with the weakness as a result of my brain tumor has also been a bit more &#34;tired&#34; than usual - facial palsy more pronounced. There have been times in my brain tumor journey where this happens for sometimes a couple of weeks at a time usually due to stress or an impending &#34;bad migraine&#34; coming on or if I have been exposed to or end up developing an illness later - but I never developed an illness an no additional stress. Facial symptoms include smile not as symmetrical (basically more assymetrical than usual - not wanting to move at all so much on the affected side) and more eye watering on the affected side. I do still feel a little lightheaded at times, but otherwise no other neurological symptoms. No upper respiratory symptoms or any other &#34;COVID-like&#34; symptoms. No nausea, vomiting, numbness, or tingling. Symptoms do seem to be improving this week.

Thought I was starting to feel myself by Sunday midday but then suddenly on Sunday afternoon almost exactly 48 hours after the shot I started to feel extreme confusion and short term memory loss. My body started shaking, I felt very hot and then very cold (back and forth) and began experiencing shortness of breath. It was all very scary and I ended up in the ER.

The patient&#39;s medical history included a latex allergy and pregnancy.  Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06-Jan-2021, approximately 30 minutes prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT 01122019) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient received her Moderna vaccine on 06 Jan 2021 at noon.  She reported that approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she went into full anaphylactic shock.  She stated that the reaction began with nausea.  She then developed hives, got low blood pressure, and was dizzy.  She was taken to the hospital.  There, she received two rounds of epinephrine along with diphenhydramine and famotidine.  She was released that same day from the hospital once she stabilized.   On 07-Jan-2021, a full 24 hours after receiving her vaccine, she experienced another anaphylactic reaction.  She stated that the reaction happened exactly like it did on 06 Jan 2021 and presented with all the same symptoms.  Patient injected herself with the epinephrine pen that she had at home as soon as the symptoms started.     In addition to the anaphylactic reactions she experienced, patient reported that she had a bad headache since receiving the vaccine as well as a stuffy nose that comes and goes and coincides with hives.  As of 10 Jan 2021, she stated that the flare ups had finally subsided, however, she continued taking diphenhydramine and famotidine as prophylaxis for anaphylactic reaction.   Treatment for the event included epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and famotidine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events, full anaphylactic shock, nausea, hives, low blood pressure, dizziness, bad headache, and stuffy nose, was not provided.   The events, full anaphylactic shock and low blood pressure were considered resolved on 07 Jan 2021. The events, nausea, hives, and dizziness were considered recovered/resolved on 10 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the events, bad headache and stuffy nose, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 36-year-old female patient with medical history of latex allergy, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 01122019), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Anaphylactic shock, the non-serious listed events of Headache and Nausea, and the non-serious unlisted events of Urticaria, Hypotension, Dizziness, and Nasal congestion.  Based on the current available information and temporal associon between the use of the product and the onset of events starting on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                I felt a pain shoot through my arm to my hand as I was being given the shot, then my arm and shoulder were very sore. I was unable to tolerate sleeping on my left side that night and I had a bad headache. My arm is still sore now but I can tolerate pressure on it better. Yesterday around 1:00 pm, the day after the shot, I began having some itching along the back of my neck near my hair line. By around 7:00 that night my neck continued to itch, I was not scratching however, but also my upper posterior neck into my hair line became red, hot, swollen, and painful. It spread equally across my posterior cervical spine from the base of my head to about C7 level (pics taken). My headache worsened and pain spread all the way down my spine to my lumbosacral region. I still have these symptoms now but to a lesser degree. I feel nauseated today as well and had to stay home from work and contact my doctor because of these symptoms.

The next day (morning after) I developed low grade fever, chills, back pain, general malaise, weakness, and a lot of pain on the arm I recieved the injection . I also had tender axillary lymph nodes, first on the same side I recieved the vaccine, a day later on both sides. Symptoms were the worst during the 24 hours after recieving the vaccine. After this, the only remaining symptoms were tender axillary lymph nodes and pain in the injection site. I used Acetaminophen for symptoms.

The redness spread across my arm and down and persisted for six days. Since the day I got the injection I?ve had numbness in my left hand that has never gone away. I saw my doctor on 1/27/21 and he said it was an inflamed nerve from the injection and it should go away eventually.

About 36 hours after the shot I finally started to feel more normal, and my fever finally broke.  Now just short of 48 hours after my I have developed a red rash like spot on top of my injection site.

I woke up in the middle of the night with a 102.7 fever, severe migraine, severe body aches, leg cramps, sore throat/swelling, and chills. I alternated taking ibuprofen and tylenol to try to control the pain, to no avail. I used bengay and cool washcloths for pain and to cool off. These did not help either. I made sure to keep drinking water and pedialyte. I took benadryl to try to sleep and help with my throat swelling up, it did not help.  All of this was non-stop until the morning of the 30th. That morning when I woke up my fever was going down and I no longer had the chills. I still had the severe headache, body pains, cramping, swollen/sore throat, and now diarrhea. Today is 2/1 and I am still experiencing severe body aches, severe headache, leg cramps, &#34;nerve pain&#34; type feeling in my arms, GI issues, and a sore/swollen throat.

                                                Dizzy, elevated heart rate, shortness of breath, fatigue - symptoms were worst upon waking in the morning approximately 15 hours post vaccine so elevated heart rate noted during sleep (Garmin heart rate monitor/watch) starting as early as 1 a.m. on 1/21 or around 10 hours post vaccine. The above symptoms subsided some approximately 24 hours post vaccine and were resolved by approximately 40 hours post vaccine. However, 1 p.m. on 1/22, noticed injection site was itchy, red, swollen, and sore. Took Benadryl that evening and swelling subsided some by next morning and completely resolved by 1/25.

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

On 2/9 those symptoms subsided, but I started to get right-sided flank pain with pain on inhalation. I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock, used a heating pad on 2/9 and 2/10, but pain progressed.  Mid-day on 2/10 the pain was so severe, I went to urgent care. They said it was gastritis and released me. I went back 2 hours later and saw a different doctor. He diagnosed me with a pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, and pleural effusion. I was sent by ambulance to the hospital and admitted. I was treated for pain and started on Eliquis. I was discharged the evening of 2/12. The morning of 2/13, I woke up with 100.6 F Temp and 85% O2 at. I went to urgent care again, they thought I had pneumonia and referred me to the hospital. I was admitted to a different hospital on 2/12 and continue to antibiotic s and a heparin drip

                                                On 2/11/2021 Three days after getting the vaccine I started to have right arm pain similar to being punched. On this same day I began to feel as though my lips were very chapped, almost as I was dehydrated. As I drink 100 oz of water daily I knew this was not the case. I treated the lips with vaseline but did not see any outward appearance of a rash or redness. The arm pain lasted two days and the lip issue resolved approximately 5 days later. On 2/20/2021 after taking a shower, I noticed a red blotchy spot on my arm where the vaccine was given. It reminded me of a Polo Vaccine scar in approximately size, was red and raised in nature. I woke up on 2/21/2021 to about 3% of my upper right arm with a rash that was warm, swollen, and the outer edges of the rash we more red and raised versus the interior part of the rash. I went to my PCP on 2/22/2021 who was very concerned as he had not seen anything like this before. His best diagnosis was an adverse effect to the vaccine that had caused some form of Fungal Infection. I was given three medications in hopes of resolving the rash: Fluconazole 100mg, Prednisone 10mg, and Cephalexin 500mg. I was told to follow up with the office on Friday if the rash was still there or to make an appointment earlier if it got worse.

Took some gas x to see if that helped. It did not. Pain got so bad that I went to er.  They thought it was my appendix,  how ever CT showed my appendix was good.  I had and still have inflammation in my intestines and still have right side pain not sure if it is related to the vaccine or not

                                                Since the Moderna vaccine, I have been having debilitating headaches  to which I had to visit the emergency room. I have NEVER  experienced headaches like this. I thought maybe it would be a short lived side effect. Unfortunately, I am now having to make an appt. with a Neurologist which I have never done before. I know this vaccine is suppose to help us battle COVID.. It is important to note: THE VACCINE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. I feel a deep a sense of frustration and regret for getting this vaccine as now I have to deal with these ongoing health issues. Also, I recently tested NEGATIVE for Covid19 just to rule out that it might be that.

I cold compress was applied to my forehead and I was put in a reclining position &amp; then received Epinephrine at 1:28PM. EMS (present onsite) arrived for transport at 1:31PM. 4L of oxygen was applied after O2 sat of 89% noted by EMS. Blood pressure was elevated to &gt;200/100 initially by EMS. Symptoms improved quickly following epinephrine, with some residual feelings of very mild throat fullness, and I developed chills which improved over time.  I was transported to emergency department where I was evaluated (symptoms mostly resolved at that time, but ED physician noted a little swelling remaining in my uvula), then IV Benadryl and Decadron were given. Later acetaminophen was also given for headache that developed during my ED stay.  My vitals were monitored throughout and observation occurred until I was discharged at approximately 5:00PM, as symptoms had not recurred.

                                                I received the vaccine on 12/29 at about 2:15pm. I had a sore left arm after shot which awoke me at 2am. I also work up due to fever (temp 100.1 ), chills, and myalgia. I had a lot of trouble sleeping that night and got very little rest as unable to get comfortable. The next day I still had fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, joint pain, low back pain, fatigue and headache (felt similar to prior bad flu symptoms). I was sent home from work early as symptoms continued throughout the day with a little relief from a 500mg of acetaminophen. The following day 12/31 symptoms were gone except for the left sore arm which was improving and now completely done on 1/3.

The following morning (24 hours post vaccine) I still was having numbness and tingling in my feet and my legs from knees down felt weak and jelly like. I still was able to walk fine, but it was uncomfortable, not able to work out etc.  12/31 (48 hours post) I worked for 10 hours this day and symptoms were the same, that evening I continued to have same symptoms and my knees and ankles ached intermittently. 1/1- Same symptoms as previous days. 1/2- Same symptoms and started having tingling down back of upper leg from butt to back of knee, still tingling in feet.  1/2- Went to ER waited 8 hours and left. 1/3- Went to ER and they ruled out Guillain Barre Syndrome (did complete neuro exam) and said they have not seen this particular reaction to the vaccine but due to presentation they believe it is a vaccine reaction. No treatment prescribed.

                                                The morning after my vaccine I woke up with a very sore upper arm. By 4pm that evening I had fatigue, chills, and body aches. I went to bed and slept much longer than normal and woke up the next morning without chills or body aches. My arm still hurt quite a bit and I started to have elbow joint and hip pain. The following day I started to have sciatica from my hip to my foot on my injection side, the left side. My elbow joint was sore for about 3-4 days after the injection. I also had some numbness right at the injection site the night of the vaccine.

The following morning (24 hours post vaccine) I still was having numbness and tingling in my feet and my legs from knees down felt weak and jelly like. I still was able to walk fine, but it was uncomfortable, not able to work out etc.  12/31 (48 hours post) I worked for 10 hours this day and symptoms were the same, that evening I continued to have same symptoms and my knees and ankles ached intermittently. 1/1- Same symptoms as previous days. 1/2- Same symptoms and started having tingling down back of upper leg from butt to back of knee, still tingling in feet.  1/2- Went to ER waited 8 hours and left. 1/3- Went to Emory ER and they ruled out GBS and said they have not seen this particular reaction to the vaccine but due to presentation they believe it is a vaccine reaction&#34;.

Did deep breathing and took a shower. Symptoms resolved on their own. I did have a very sore arm for about three days after the administration of the vaccine. Redness to the injection site with a knot under the injection site for three days.

                                                At minute 12 after injection (8:31am on 1/5/20), the pruritis started on my scalp and my back. I informed the volunteer at the end of the drive line. She offered to have EMS evaluate me, however I declined as I thought the reaction was mild. Over the next 10 minutes, after being released from the driveline, I was so itchy I wanted to literally rip all of my skin off. The back of my throat started to itch, but never felt tight or swollen. No SOB or chest tightness. I checked my temp at 8:45 and I was at 101.0 and HR was 110bpm. I am a PA working in dermatology and got to work and took 50mg of diphenhydramine PO but was not improving. One of the doctors I work with and I decided it was best for me to get checked out in urgent care. I had my MA drive me there and was seen immediately. I had a blotchy rash over my entire body, but not raised or hived. Temp was 100.6, HR 86 and BP 127/78, respirations 16/min O2 sat 98% and the itchiness was still severe but I could tell the diphenhydramine was kicking in. I was then given 40mg of famotidine PO and 10mg Dexamethasone IM in the right buttocks while in urgent care. After about 15 minutes, my symptoms were improving, but not resolved. I was released and went home to rest. Throughout the day yesterday (1/5/20) my heart rate would spike as high as 130bmp (my normal is 60-70bpm). Then it would come down within a few seconds to about 100bpm and steadily stay between 90-100bpm all day. Last night I was woken up at 3:30am (1/6/20) with a HR of 132bpm and O2 at 97%. I took a few deep breaths, and it slowly started to drop to 100bpm. Since 6:00am, I am steady at 70-80bpm with occasional spikes of 96-100bpm and I can feel when my heart is starting to race. I have my pulse ox on for the day and will continue to monitor my symptoms. I still have occasional pruritis, but it&#39;s tolerable. I was discharged from urgent care with PO Prednisone tapered dose, however, I am very shaky already and do not want to make it worse, so have not started it yet. Not sure if I should? And I would like to know if I should receive the second dose? If so, should I pre-medicate? Please let me know if you have any further questions about my event. Thanks.

I didnt think it was related to the vaccine.  I just thought it was a muscle strain but now i have  lump under my arm pit.  I believe this is lymphadenopathy.

Best way to explain it is that feeling you get when your arm falls asleep and is waking up. I&#39;ve spoke to a few others who had similar feeling in their vaccine arm.

I have also had severe chills, nausea, vomited twice, generalized weakness and shakiness.  It is currently 12:10pm on 1/8/21 and these symptoms continue.  Two of my other co-workers were at this same facility at the same time on 1/7 and have had very similar symptoms as well as severe headache which prevented them to work today.  We are all physical therapists, healthy young individuals, no co-comorbidities and were very surprised by these negative reactions and concerned.

At around 3 PM, I felt feverish and had a fever of 100.4.  I felt general malaise and achy all evening.  This morning, I still have a bit of a headache, but feel much better than yesterday.

                                                While waiting the 15 minutes after the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy, I thought it was just because I was nervous.  After the 15 minutes, I went outside and tood off my mask to get some fresh air.  I went back to work and was still feeling dizzy.  I drank water, ate some food and sat for a bit.  At about 1pm, I was still feeling dizzy but also started feeling off, as if I were intoxicated or like how you feel when you just wake up from having anesthesia, sluggish.  I then went home and slept for about 5 hours and now I feel much better.  Will someone let me know if it is recommended I still get the second dose next month?

Then the left side of my face started to feel numb from the corner of my left eye to my hairline/ear and down to my chin. the numbness felt like that side of my face fell asleep. this persisted for the evening. I took Benadryl 50mg and claratin. The next day symptoms had improved but were still noticeable. I took an additional dose of 25 mg of benadryl and claratin 10mg. the following day (Tuesday) symptoms had resolved.  The day following the vaccine I felt fatigue, nausea and headache.  Tueday-Friday following vaccine fatigue and headache has persisted in varying degrees

The pain has become so severe that I cannot use my left arm.  The pain is intolerable.  I take four Advil every six hours, ice my arm regularly, and keep my arm in a sling.  The pain has gotten significantly worse with time (not better).  I?ve never experienced pain like this from a vaccine in my life.  No history of bursitis or shoulder injury.  Again, the pain gets worse with time.  I?m almost 48 hours post injection

Patient was monitored for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine without incident. The following is a written statement from patient describing events: &#34;About 30 minutes after vaccine, I felt like I had hit my elbow on something. Discomfort radiated from left elbow to wrist- I did have pain around injection site. About 8:30pm on 1/8/21, area around injection site became more painful. Gradually pain increased radiating down to finger tips and up to left side of neck, stopped right below ear. Neck and shoulder muscles felt really tight- uncomfortable ache. Also got extremely tired- left side of face felt numb- left eye slightly blurry- I fell asleep about 10pm. Woke up a few hours later drenched in sweat. Face numbness gone, eyesight normal.? Patient reports the following day 1/9/2021 @ 2pm: ?All of a sudden I started to sweat all over. I didn?t feel hot, only last about 30 minutes.? Patient reports on Sunday 1/10/2021: ?Woke up feeling okay. Left arm and neck still ached but not as bad. Got fatigued around 10am. I got a headache that became really bad. Dizzy, nauseous- no relief from OTC meds. Headache went away after a few hours.? Patient reports today 1/11/2021: ?Today I am still very tired. My left arm, fingertips, shoulders and neck still ache. Face is flushed.? Patient does state previous reactions to prior vaccines: ?TdaP about 7 years ago made me have joint pain for months. Last flu shot received was about 9 years ago, had flu like symptoms x12 hours.? Patient did not seek any medical care for the reaction described above. Patient?s PCP has been also been made aware of her reaction.

By 5pm I could not wiggle my fingers or even the slightest movement in my arm. At 7pm I started with a headache, complete body shakes, and a fever of 100. In the night it spiked to 102.6 All day Friday my fever stayed at 101-102.8. I had a bad headache and could not get any relief in my arm. My body ached and still had shakes from time to time. I took ibuprofen a couple of times to help with the pain and fever. By Saturday around 10am I had zero symptoms. Since then I have felt great.

                                                About 1 or 2 days after receiving my first Moderna injection, I noticed slight numbness/tingling to my left calf and left side of left foot.  I first noticed this when I was shaving. It&#39;s not always noticeable.  I am currently still having the same symptoms.  I did not report this on my V-Safe survey as I was not sure if it was caused by the vaccine.  I&#39;m still not sure.

My provider initially treated me with Keflex and told me I had cellulitis caused by the vaccine. I took the antibiotics (500mg x 3 per day) for 5 days and the area got much worse. I went back to the doctor and was told it was actually an allergic reaction. I was treated with Prednisone and Benadryl for 7 days. The area cleared up after that treatment, but is still slightly discolored.

I also had an extremely sore deltoid where injection site occurred for 48hrs, much worse than I&#39;ve ever had for any vaccine or IM injection.

The back of my tongue became very dry.   I felt better after 10 minutes and never passed out.  They took my vital signs and everything was normal.  I have never been bothered by needles before at all so it was strange.  However I do have a long history of anxiety so it?s possible it was just that.

Tues Jan 12 midday while at work began experiencing increased post nasal drip and stiffness in my left lateral neck extending up towards basilar skull. Started taking Claritin after shift to help with congestion.  Thur Jan 14 Congestion is manageable with Claritin. Stiff neck is worse upon waking up around 8am and has spread to right side; left side remains most painful. Range of motion turning head leftward is limited and painful; turning head rightward is uncomfortable but range of motion not limited.  Sat Jan 16 Congestion is manageable with Claritin. Neck stiffness decreased somewhat throughout the workday and feels more sore than painful. Noted discomfort at left deltoid late into shift around 10pm. Noted mild redness and edema over left lateral deltoid where vaccine was administered approximately 7cm wide and 9cm long. Area feels more firm to touch and feels tight when moving left arm.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

I started feeling dizzy, a buzzing in my ears and broke into a sweat. I tried to stand up and walk over to my bed, but lost my balance and collapsed for about 5 seconds. Once I regained consciousness I stopped sweating, rested for a bit and then was able to resume normal function (drinking water, coffee, something sugary).

The nurses on staff said that several other people had reported the same. Within about 30-40 minutes after leaving the clinic, I also had bilateral facial numbness and tingling lips. The arm and facial numbness lasted for about 5 hours and lessened right before I went to bed and this morning only my arm hurts (normal vaccine site pain).

Also very vivid dreams, headache and intermittent nausea, but no vomiting. R upper arm at injection site is very tender, but no redness or warmth.  Ibuprofen helped with the aches and chills.   Unsure of exact temp, as thermometer just reads ?low? (think the battery needs to be replaced).   Pt rested, increased fluids, and used anti-pyretics as needed to recover. Symptoms subsided after 24 hours.

                                                Reaction began to develop 8 days after getting vaccinated. The injection site turned red, was swollen and warm and has spread in size for a couple of days. I had a headache for a few days prior to my reaction on Wednesdays and my left underarm hurt. Additionally, swallowing after eating or drinking hurt for a couple of days. My body was weak and I felt feverish despite not having any fever. I am currently being treated by my physician as if I have Cellulitis and was prescribed antibiotics as well as instructed to take an antihistamine with the antibiotic. Today is my first day on the medication so I do not know the outcome yet.

                                                Around 7 pm on Feb 22 I started feeling very fatigued and I had some body aches. I decided to go to bed early to try to sleep it off. About 5 am on Feb 23 I was woken up by a splitting headache. I also felt feverish and had the chills. My head hurt so bad, worse than any migraine I had ever had. I got out of bed to take some ibuprofen and could hardly even walk my body hurt so bad. I took the ibuprofen and went back to bed until about 8 am. When I woke up at 8 I felt okay other than a slight headache that lasted until about 7 pm when I took another dose of ibuprofen.

Approximately 11 hours after receiving the vaccine I developed mild chills, body aches, headache, and fever to 100.9F (temp checked about 14 hours after vaccine was given). I was able to sleep at and was afebrile the following day. My left arm (where the vaccine was given) was also sore for about 2-3 days. (After the first Moderna COVID vaccine my left arm was sore more so than for any other vaccine for about 24 hours). Of note, this is the first time I&#39;ve had a fever in my adult life, despite extensive travel to developing countries and working in hospital settings.

I became pregnant about two weeks after first dose and this, the second dose, was given at four weeks pregnant (due date oct 1 2021). Side effects included fever, chills, muscle aches, very sore arm, light-headedness, tachcardia.

Large oblong welt about 2 inches across at injection site. Symptoms started within a few hours of getting the injection and became steadily very significant by the next day. It took about 7 days to recover from the most significant symptoms and was still recovering from mild bruise and occasional itching but no redness. Today (1/26/2021) my arm started itching again, and I see that I have a large flat circular (about 2 inches across) red spot right where I had the welt a week ago.

                                                Within 4.5 hours my arm was beginning to become sore. hour 5-6 I felt nauseous and foggy and body aches slowly started. I felt like I didn&#39;t get any rest that night, between the tossing and turning due to body aches and very sore arm. when I woke up I did take some Midol, it was all I had on me at that moment.  From there I still came to work, because I knew we wouldn&#39;t have the staff to cover our department . I had a cycle of symptoms. starting with the major body and joint pains, red injection site with heat. Then I started profusely sweating. Like I had just finished a 90 cardio session. That lasted about an hour-two. and then It started over. I had the same symptoms about 3-4 cycles worth. as soon as one would start to subside another one started. When I finally got home I took Some Excedrin and within 3 hours after that my body aches were very dull and my I could move my arm without throbbing pain anymore. I have now it the 48 hour mark. At hour 45 I started sweating again and my arm is still tender, but hours 4-34 were the worst. I just want to point out I Know the shot is injected high into the muscle, But my injection site was at the very top of my arm/shoulder.

I slept for one hour and woke up with intense chills, muscle aches, and pins and needles all throughout my body. I developed a headache and became short of breath an hour later, and was unable to walk more than a few feet without becoming extremely fatigued. 15 hours later I&#39;m still experiencing the same symptoms.

                                                I woke up in extreme pain in my right shoulder. I couldn&#39;t lift my arm without the help of my other arm.  Raising it and lowering were extremely painful.  I couldn&#39;t raise it above my waist. This lasted for about 8 hours. I took 800 mg Ibuprofen and I could finally move my arm to chest level but it still ached, even when just laying at my side so I had to hold it to my chest. After 4 days, it felt better but there was still pain when raising my arm over my head. It felt like I had ripped something in my shoulder at the rotator cuff. 4 days later, the pain came back and I had to once again hold my arm at chest level for 2 days. Yesterday, January 28th, I went to my doctor and received a steroid injection in my shoulder and they also put in MRI orders.

                                                Thursday morning I awakened sluggish and feeling foggy in the brain. I had chills and a tmeperature of 100.3 with tylenol. At 11:42 am my temp was 102.3. I had severe headache, fatigue, bodyaches, chills. neck stiffness and joint pain, light sensitivity, nausea/loss of appetite. Moderate swelling at injection site (left deltoid) and swollen lymph nodes. Dizziness.  I slept most of the day, awakening to use the bathroom and at that time check my temp. Today 1/29/2021 some things have improved. my temp have improved 98.5, my headache is there but not a 10. I still have not eaten today. I am still taking tylenol. The light sensitivity is gone. The neck stiffness is there, but improving.

She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.  Caregiver moved her back to bed with blanket and noted that her lips were blue and at that point called 911.  She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.

Both continued and on the 4th I went to the Care Now Urgent Care COVID test.  No treatment except ibuprofen; Claritin; Tylenol - those helped some. I had the headache and sinus congestion until Wednesday - and then I felt pretty much back to normal except for some fatigue for next two days. I got the second dose of the vaccine - Monday, January 25th. I had a bad headache - and achy feeling - but after 24 hours I felt back to normal again.

I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

                                                Shot given at 3:47- approximately 3-5 minutes later started to experience blurred vision, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.   Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

                                                7 days after the injection,  on 12/31 morning,  hives appeared 10cm below the injection site to left arm. Progressively, left arm became red, warm to touch, hard, swollen, itchy and painful through the course of the day. It spread rapidly and pain was radiating under left breast, where the lymph nodes are located, behind back/shoulder. The following  day it has spread even further,  down to elbow; numbing/tingling sensation radiating to left pinkie and left ring fingers.   Vital signs: higher than normal systolic BP 130-150s (normal for me:100-110s); tachycardic with HR in 130-140s on the first day of the adverse event, O2 sats normal high 90s to 100% on RA. No fever, highest temp 99.2F.

I was woken up by a numbness, and tinging sensation in left side of face that continued all day Saturday, and into Sunday. I also experienced fatigue, itching, and a tingling rash sensation in several parts of body on, and off.  On Monday morning I awoke without the facial numbness, and tingling sensations but i do have numbness and tingling in the right lower extremity.

                                                I started developing a lump at the vaccination site on my left arm the next day. It was very painful, red, swollen and had a big lump. I also started getting itchy there too. My arm was a lot more painful than I&#39;ve ever experienced from any other vaccines such as the flu shot. I also have never had a reaction to one before. 2 days later I was in the express care for my daughter and had the PA look at it and he said if it doesn&#39;t get better by Monday (12/28) call my primary care physician. Monday came around and it started getting better, so I didn&#39;t call, by Wednesday it continued to get better but not completely gone. Thursday (12/31) I developed a lump again, painful, swelling, red patch at the injection site, hot to the touch. I had a virtual visit with my primary care physician and he said I&#39;m having an allergic reaction at the vaccination site. He prescribed me 3 days of Prednisone 50mg/day, Claritin 2x daily &amp; Pepcid 2x daily all for 3 days. It has finally resolved now.

                                                1/2/2021: In the evening, I  started experiencing swelling (felt like a hard knot under the skin), itching, redness, and heat at the injection site. Earlier in the day I noticed a little pain discomfort in my right arm pit. As the day wore on, I noticed swelling in my lymph nodes and the level of discomfort increased to the point that it disturbed my sleep. 1/3/2021: The pain and swelling at the injection site and armpit continued to be the same. I took ibuprofen to try and alleviate the level of discomfort. That evening before bed also took Benadryl to see if it would help with the injection site reaction. I also started experiencing a dull shooting pain and tingling from my armpit down to my wrist on my right arm. 1/4/2021: The injection site improved, no more knot, heat, or itching. It still remained a little swollen. Lymph nodes were still swollen throughout the day, but manageable with ibuprofen. Shooting pain and tingling still occurring sporadically throughout the day. 1/5/2021: Still a little discomfort in the armpit, but seems to be improving.

                                                The say after receiving the vaccine, 12/24, I experienced normal side effects including pain in my arm, fatigue, and mild fever.  These SEs improved daily and by Monday, 12/28, I was free from SEs.  However on the morning of 12/31 I began experiencing mild pain in my upper left arm again. By mid day I had developed a raised, red, warm area around the injection site a bit smaller than a baseball.  I applied an ice pack.  The area enlarged by 1/1 and I continued to apply ice and took a dose of diphenhydramine.  It appeared to be less red on 1/2 but started to worsen again on 1/3, becoming larger and redder again.  It began to itch on 1/4.  Today it is larger than the size of my entire hand (including fingers), extending to about 3 inches above the bend of my arm.  It continues to be itchy, warm, raised, and red, primarily around the perimeter and the lower portion of the site.  While this is not a severe reaction it concerns me that it was delayed and continues to worsen and is not improved by diphenhydramine.

                                                Employee Recollection: Wednesday and Thursday  felt kind of weak and more tired than normal, but thought nothing of it.  In the early afternoon on Friday the symptoms got worse.   Tired and confused.  I slept through my alarm and woke up to my mom, who was watching my daughter for me, trying to wake me up.  I was very confused, dizzy and weak.  My mom said I was really out of it, and that I had a really hard time focusing on what she was trying to say to me.    When I checked in for work my O2 stats were in the upper 80&#39;s lower 90&#39;s.  My temp was also in the lower 90&#39;s.  That was after numerous attempts at taking my o2 stats and temps.  Co-worker said I was very confused, tired, dizzy and weak.  She said there were times when I was walking that I would reaching for walls and railings to regain my balance.  I left work at 6am Saturday morning.  I went home and went straight to bed.  Slept all day long until a few hours before my shift started at 9:30 P.M.   since then I&#39;ve been feeling better, but my temp and 02 stats are still low.  But I&#39;m continuing to monitor symptoms.  I&#39;ll keep you posted if anything changes.

Tuesday I woke up within 20mins I was nauseous and threw up multiple times. My body was achy and just felt &#34;blah&#34;. Was weak and dizzy when I stood up. I felt like my insides were on fire (like the worst temperature you&#39;ve ever had) but didn&#39;t have a fever. Felt like my brain was going to swell out of my head and it was the worst headache. I slept all day. Woke up long enough to call the dr and fell back asleep. Halfway through the day I ended up with a fever of 102 (it went down after a few hrs). Today I woke up still feeling weak and somewhat dizzy, spacey.

Advised to go to ER for Covid Test, since I had worked closely with someone else positive the previous week. Husband had to call an ambulance when I couldn?t make it out of the bedroom due to weakness, true vertigo-room was completely spinning and couldn?t keep my balance, and severe vomiting with any upright movement. Covid test negative. ER diagnosed as BPPvertigo because no other outright viral symptoms; only sneezing before; but they noted fluid in my left ear- said wasn?t infected. Told them of headache in back left rear of head, behind ear, and pressure behind left eye. Positive Dix-Hallpike;nystagmus. Vertigo continued, even with medication through Thursday 12/31/20 and turned to dizziness that subsided by Saturday 1/2/21. Weds 12/30/20- severe left ear pressure, feeling of fullness; focal pain/headache in bone behind left ear began, and pressure behind left eye increased. Low grade fever 1/2/21-1/4/21 (99.9). Seen by ENT on 1/4/21 due to continuing symptoms; and was misdiagnosed originally by ER- diagnosed by ENT as Acute Viral Labyrinthitis and Vestibular Neuritis. As of 1/6/2021- symptoms continue.   *suspected recovered from Covid March 2020

                                                Just about 15 mins after recieving vaccination, I  experienced increased shortness of breath, feeling weak, slight headache, and my heart seemed to race.  When I shared this with the pharmasist, she did not offer to take vitals nor seemed concerned.  She suggested that I was experiencing anxiety, and that it was not a typical reaction to the vaccine.  However, each day since vaccine I have continued to have episodes of shortness of breath.  Today, 3 days after the vaccine, I had more shortness of breath than I had since first contracting Covid-19(which was on 10th of Dec).  I also was having to stop walking several times every 5 mins or so in order to catch my breath, feeling weakness and fatigue.  My sense or taste/smell is gone as well. I was so short of breath today, work was worried anough about me they urged me to go home and call my doctor.  I now have a tele-visit set up with my doctor today.

                                                Today morning one of the employee at nursing home had a reaction to Covid vaccine. I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

                                                I had severe facial swelling that started on my left cheek and lip the morning after the vaccine. That night the swelling mover to the center of my face (mainly my bottom lip and some of my chin). Day 2 the swelling was most severe and moved to my right cheek and lip. The swelling was less the night of day 2 and even better the morning of day 3 after starting oral prednisone . Today on day four I am Almost back to normal but still some puffiness in both cheeks and bottom lip.  Per my physicians advice I will be on a 5day course of oral prednisone (10mg 2x/day)  The other adverse event I experienced was starting day 2 I had extreme pain and itching as well as some cyst like bumps on both my feet as well as very mild itching on my palms.They are improving on day 4 but still super itchy. I have been advised to take Benadryl as needed for that.

                                                I  got it at 2pm Friday.  About 2 hours later my arm started feeling sore but not too bad. I did some light yoga and walked on the treadmill for 40 minutes.  Otherwise took it easy that day. Satu I woke up with a slight headache which isn&#39;t unusual for me.  I still had mild soreness in my arm. I did a more difficult yoga workout and then walked 5 miles outside.  Took a shower after and relaxed for a bit. Then had dinner around 5 and within the hour started having diarrhea.  This lasted a few hours during which my arm started gradually hurting more, it was pretty bad. Could barely move it and hurt to the touch even. Shivering started soon after.  I never had a fever or fatigue during all of this. Highest temp was 98.4 with forehead thermometer. I talked to a doctor to put my mind at ease and he said I was having a big immune response to the vaccine, apparently younger adults between 20 to 40 are having bigger immune responses. The second dose is stronger so most are  having these symptoms after that one, but some are having it after the first as well. He also told me I should have taken it easy these past 2 days and that I likely overdid it. He advised that I take motrin or Tylenol, get under blankets to stay warm, and rest. That&#39;s exactly what I did and a little over an hour later I was feeling much better.   I&#39;m a bit freaked out by what the second dose is going to do to me since it is supposed to be worse. Is it safe for me to get second dose?

                                                I had the vaccine Sunday night and experienced fatigue that night, and then developed arm soreness that lasted for a little over 24 hours. I also developed minor body aches and felt crummy Monday and Tuesday. I was then fine for the rest of that week. Monday, January 4th at 7:30 PM, I felt something tingly, burning, and hot on my left arm. When I looked at it, I had a large round red rash that had a knot and was hot to the touch and itchy. At 3:30 AM on Tuesday morning, I woke up in pain and crying. I went to Urgent Care to have it assessed. The doctor diagnosed it as cellulitis in relation to an infection at the injection site and gave me an antibiotic and drew around it with a surgical marker. He told me to go to my PCP if it grew outside of the line or to the ER if I developed severe symptoms. On Wednesday, it had grown and was not getting any better and had started forming blisters. I called my PCP and he told me to take 2 Loratadine every 24 hours and to come in if it was not better by Friday. It appeared to be getting better and I was fine on Thursday. Friday morning, I woke up in pain again. The rash had spread across the majority of my upper arm. It was red and painful and itching with heat. I went in to see my PCP and he diagnosed it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He gave me a steroid, which seems to be suppressing the rash and symptoms. I still have a rash and itchiness, but my physician said it could last for another week or two until it goes away.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

Nausea, tiredness and headaches are still going on a week later. On Monday the 11th i noticed that it felt like i had a cyst under my arm but im later told it could be my lymphoid that could be swollen. I&#39;ve also have had muscle weakness and fatigue since a few days after the shot.

                                                On 12/28/2020 at 1930 I had a throbbing HA, nausea, chills, no appetite, body aches, extreme fatigue and low grade fever. Temp was 99.4-100.3. 1 gram of Tylenol was taken that evening, to relieve HA pain. Zofran 4 mg ODT was also taken for nausea. The following morning,  I felt extremely fatigued and had a persistent headache that was not consistently responsive to OTC meds. I developed a fever on 12/29/2020 in the evening. Low grade and ranging 99.3-100.6. Along with fever, my s/s were extreme fatigue, no appetite, headache, body aches, chills. On 12/30/2020, I spiked a Tmax of 101.0 around 11 am. Again, the same s/s were there. I went home from work early.  Same s/s and low grade fever persisted past 7 days, so I called my PCP as well as the Pharmacy where I received the vaccine. On the 10th day after vaccination, I notified my Infectious Disease Dr. He advised me to wait 6 months to 1 year to receive the second injection. He stated that my s/s were likely vaccine related and would go away with time. Fever persists through every day for the month of January 2021, with exact same symptoms. Started to notice Shortness of breath with activity, occasional sharp pain in chest. Presented to ER on 01/09/2021 with chest pain and shortness of breath. Labs revealed Acute Kidney Injury and Transaminitis. Cardiac work-up was performed, all tests negative. I was hypotensive. MD recommended I either get transferred to hospital, or stay in ER for min 23 hours observation for monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure. I received 2 L of Normal Saline. BP eventually began to rise with SBP above 90 and DBP above 40. (Normal BP range for me is 120/60-70&#39;s. Baseline Creatinine is 0.9. Discharged from ER per patient request, after second Creatinine level came down to 1.5. MD advised patient to not return to work for the next 2 business days. Spoke with PCP on 1/11/2021 in AM, and informed him of the events over the weekend. Also informed him that I am still febrile with same symptoms as reported previously. Was told I could not return to work until I was fever free. Was fever free for about 12 hours, until evening of 1/12/2021. MD not allow patient to RTW.

Yesterday, 1/14/21(9days after receiving the vaccine), I noticed that my arm was itching where I received the vaccine and when I looked it was all red and swollen. Not having any pain and have had no other reactions to the vaccine. I am scheduled February 2nd for my 2nd vaccine. Will it be okay to receive it?

After 5 days?: Developed small red, slightly elevated dots on left hand.  Also, developed white circular patch on left shoulder.  The red dots on left hand are improving day by day. The white patch on shoulder is still there.  Visited my doctor today (Jan 15). He discussed hypersensitivity on left hand, and vitiligo on left shoulder.  I am concerned about getting 2nd dose of vaccine and possible reaction thereafter.  Why did I get vitiligo? Will vitiligo worsen after 2nd dose? Will the hypersensitivy on hand translate to a stronger reaction/allergic reaction after 2nd dose? Thank you.

Random itching of injection site. General fatigue.  Have had previous reaction to flu shot, mainly 10&#43; years ago when shot was not preservative free.

                                                Six days after, I started being  awakened by the pain of my lips swelling to 3xs their size, tongue slightly swollen and throat possibly.  I took a Benedryl or Claritin and Advil.  Eight  hours after the 1st vaccine, I experienced severe aches and pain, fatigue lasting almost 72hrs. Even the joints of fingers aches but the pain in my lymph node in my left armpit felt like someone hit me with a baseball bat (injection was in left arm).

Over next 15 min started feeling nauseated, lips started to tingle, mouth and tongue felt heavy and I had to try harder to enunciate words. Went to ED and received prednisone. Tongue was a little swollen at this point. Airway was regularly checked and did not close.

                                                Vaccine given at 2pm. By 9pm that same night I could not move my arm without crying from the pain.  I woke upbat 5am and the pain was still just as bad. Any little movement was excruciating. I could not change my clothes, brush my hair, wash my face. The only reason I waa still able to work is because I am a teacher and we are remote so I was able to sign on from home and sit at my desk with my arm in an imaginary swing because that was the only time it did not hurt. Later that night I could begin to move my arm a little before pain started but still needed help getting dressed, etc. The next two days I was able to move it little more before pain started.  It is now 5 days later and I can lift my arm up. I still feel pain but it ia tolerable.

The next day my right arm was sore lasting about 1.5 days. 2 days later I developed constipation for 4 days. All of that resolved. On Friday 1/15/21  I woke up with the injection site on my right arm hurting again. On Saturday 1/16/21 I noticed a 1 inch circular rash at the injection site that was hot,achy, and itching. This morning 1/18/21 I noticed that the circular rash has increased in size to 3 inch diameter, accompanied by aching, burning, and itching at the site along with dizziness, headache, and nausea.

                                                38 year old female - healthy with no significant past medical history. Morning of 1/15/21, pt woke up with difficulty speaking  (would be talking and then unable to articulate words which were replaced by grunting sounds) and tingling to her face. No changes to breathing, no numbness/tingling to extremities, equal facial symmetry. Slow onset of symptoms. Pt went to the ED, where she received a CT, MRI (inconclusive reading), lab work reported as normal per pt, EKG and chest x-ray. Symptoms self resolved while in the ED, however MD staff wanted to admit patient for 24 hours of observation and to complete an echocardiogram. Pt left AMA the evening of 1/15/21 due to resolution of symptoms and wanting to follow up with her cardiologist for the echocardiogram. Pt told by MD staff symptoms were likely caused by either TIA, possible reaction to vaccine or migraine presentation (no report of headaches/auras). Plan was to have patient on blood thinners x 30 days then baby Aspirin thereafter. Pt still needing to follow up with PCP and cardiologist for further work up.

When I woke up the day after I had a HUGE lump on my arm at the injection site. It looked like a golf ball. It was red and hot. It stayed this way for about 3 more days and finally started to go down. The red mark at the injection spot remained though and continued hurting until about day 9 after the shot. Then it started getting itchy but remained red. I am now over 2 weeks post shot and the red mark is still slightly there but not very visible and the pain and itchiness has gone away.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 10 minutes after receiving vaccine throat began tingling and I noticed my heart rate was 164 on my apple watch.  Notified nursed overseeing the monitoring.  Nurses began hooking my up to monitoring equipment. Heart rate came down to 120.  Nurses noticed flushing in face and blotchiness on arms. After an additional 15 minutes of monitoring, flushing was still present as well as throat tingling (just tingling, no swelling), so nurses sent me to the ER for further monitoring.  Upon arrival to ER temperature was 100.2 F. (Temperature before vaccine was 97 F, no fevers recorded after ER visit).  In ER fluids and zofran were given and was released after two hours of monitoring.  In the evening I experienced moderate pain in the left arm (very painful to lift arm above shoulder level) that lasted about 24 hours.  I also had a mild to moderate headache that lasted about 24 hours, beginning the evening of the vaccine.   I also experienced mild to moderate nausea that began the day of the vaccine (Saturday, 12/26) and was on and off through Wednesday, 12/30.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

Little out of it feeling.  This was pretty much done by 1/1/21. 1/7/21 one week and a day after injection, injection site became raised, hard, inflamed looking  and was itchy. Site was visibly red and raised and had approximate 3 in diameter.  Previously mentioned symptoms began again (waves of hot flashes, nausea, aches).  This lasted at least until bedtime.  Next day, 1/8/21 felt better and injection site, though still hard and red, reduced down to size of quarter.  No further symptoms BUT injection site now as of 1/20/21 still looks like a quarter sized bruise.

I saw my PCP who ordered a thyroid ultrasound, which showed multiple thyroid cysts, the largest was about 3 cm in diameter, which warranted a biopsy. I had that performed this week, with negative pa to log, but now I have to get serial ultrasounds of the cysts to ensure stability in the future. I have never had any thyroid or cyst issues in the past.

                                                Left arm pain began on Thurs. 1/7/21, approximately 30 minutes after vaccine.  Severe headache and pain radiating to left side of neck began approximately 22 hours after vaccine (around 2pm on 1/8/21) and left arm pain worsened.  On 1/9/21, unable to get out of bed-felt like I had been drugged- severe HA, fatigue, and left side of neck soreness.  Felt slightly better on 1/10/21 and 1/11/21, however stil unable to get out of bed due to severe HA and fatigue.  On morning of 1/12/21, fatigue relieved and severe HA relieved around 1pm.  Since 1/12/21, Severe HA, left arm tightness and left neck soreness has continued intermittently.  This is a HA I have never experienced before.  Yesterday, on 1/21/21, I had a severe HA all day at work and when I went home, I had to lie down the rest of the day/evening d/t severe HA, fatigue and left neck tightness.  I was unable to do daily chores and help my children with their homework.  I also woke up this morning with the same severe HA and left neck soreness/tightness.  I do feel this HA is from the vaccine as I have never experienced this type of HA prior to receiving the vaccine and I am not someone who gets HA&#39;s often.    I know the vaccine was given too high, as I give vaccines often for my career, and I am wondering if that has anything to do with my neck pain.  I did bleed a lot with the injection (do not think it went into my muscle) and am wondering if that has anything to do with my adverse reaction.  I am fearful these severe HA&#39;s will continue and I am extremely hesitant to receive my second dose!

                                                About 5-6 days after vaccine injection on 1/15/21, I developed a rash, itching, and pain on the same arm as my injection. It is also warm to the touch. I went to Urgent Care and they think it is cellulitis from the vaccine. I am on Bactrim DS to see if it will help. My blood pressure was low as well, not sure if it&#39;s related but usually by pressure is fine. I had cupping done at the chiropractor on 1/22 on my neck and back, symptoms started later that evening. Not sure if is is a coincidence or not.

                                                Received second COVID vaccine Moderna on Wednesday evening at 6pm.  Later that night, I was a little light-headed and achey, but went to bed. On thursday, my legs and arms were extremely achy. I took Tylenol and Motrin in the morning. It seemed to help some, but continued to feel very achy in my legs. I left work early (I am a pediatrician) on Thursday and went home and just sat and rested.  I felt terrible, but had talked to other colleagues who felt very bad that first day after the shot. Friday morning, I woke up still achy but feeling better overall. I took motrin and Tylenol again on Friday morning. I worked the whole day seeing patients. Was tired, but got thru the workday. At around 6pm, I noticed petechiae rash on my lower legs. The rash started spreading thru the night- up my legs and to my arms. I went to ER. They did order CBC, CMP. Platelets were undetectable- 1 platelet was seen under microscope. CMP was normal.  I was told to go to bigger hospital. I went, My platelets read as 4. I was admitted for two nights. Two doses of IVIG were given and I was put on Decadron 40mg PO daily for 4 days. I had tylenol, benadryl, zofran before the IVIG and after.  I will see Hematology next week for follow up. Platelets yesterday at discharge were 60.  Will be checked frequently for the next few months. ITP= diagnosis. COVID shot was trigger.

                                                Patient began complaining that her arm was numb, and her mouth was itchy with a metallic taste.   tongue felt &#34;thick&#34; but no problems breathing.  BP maintained at 120&#39;s over 80&#39;s.   Gave 50mg of benedryl and continued to observe.   Symptoms began to resolve after about 20 minutes, mouth numbness was last to resolve.

Upon waking the next day at 9am, fatigue, body aches, and chills were lessened significantly.  Around 2:30pm, I took 2 advil and the body aches and chills went away shortly after.  Fever/sweaty feeling continued into the evening and overnight.  Woke up the next morning feeling much better (thank god!) and all symptoms gone.

The day following also was tired achy and felt off/headache. On Thursday symptoms went away other than the arm and a slight headache. On Saturday the redness and I ring was gone, but I started having pain in my armpit and when I moved my arm in different positions. Hand was tingling with certain positions suggesting nerve pain. Lasted 2 to 3 days and got worse before better. Was mostly gone by Tuesday. Wednesday 8 days after injections the redness, itching, and swelling in my arm returned. Same size as the day after my injection. Called the doctor to see if I need to be concerned that the redness, itchyness, and swelling returned after completely going away 4 days earlier. Also feeling tired for the past 3 to 4 days but otherwise good. Some minor discomfort/pain in collar bone around and lump node in neck but is not consistent. Comes and goes. Not sure if the nerve pain in arm was related to the vaccine, but since the redness returned it may all be related.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart started racing and I began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I am an athlete and am used to fast cardio, racing heart, but this was not like anything I had ever felt before. I had difficulty located a nurse to help me. When someone finally saw I needed help, the nurse came over and took my blood pressure and pulse. She said my pulse was abnormally high as was my blood pressure and that I looked bad. She told me to take deep breaths and asked if it were a panic attack. I said it was not. I was able to control my breathing and stay calm and I eventually my heart rate came down. She did not offer me a place to lay down even though I felt like passing out. She told me that I should sit a little longer. Within another 10 minutes the same exact reaction happened again. At this point I told her I was a little worried as I&#39;ve never had this kind of reaction before. She then took my bloood pressure and pulse again and told me to deep breathe. The pulse and blood pressure eventually came down. She asked me if I wanted water. I had water and some trail mix that I happen to have on me. I had to use the restroom, she walked me to the restroom. Once I realized I was not going to be offered any additional care, I decided to try and drive home. By the time I was home those symptoms had subsided, but I had a terrible migraine headache (Friday night). I went to bed and woke up the next morning with a small headache (Saturday morning). The migraine came back that night along with intense arm pain. The next morning (Sunday morning) after that I felt better and then later that night the migraine came back. On Monday those symptoms had subsided. I seemed to be getting better, but on Friday, January 22 (one week after the initial vaccine) my arm was burning and swollen and itched a lot. The injection site was warm to the touch and very tender. The swelling lasted until Sunday, January 24th. I finally called my physician on Monday, January 25th. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should get the second dose or not. Her nurse called me back and told me that my symptoms were not normal and that if I wanted to get the second dose I could take Benadryl ahead of time. I have not taken the second dose at this point.  Today, January 27th, my arm seems to be better, but occasionally itches and I feel a sharp pain sometimes at random. My second dose is scheduled for February 12, 2021.

The next morning, I woke with minor side effects body aches, chills, slight fever and arm sore from injection. As the day progressed, my symptoms got worse. By body aches were so severe that it hurt to stand, sit, bend and curl my toes. My head was so full of congestion by the end of the night. I was meeting with a small group of family for New Year&#39;s and thought that I would get checked to make sure that it was nothing. I was tested for COVID and for Influenza. I came back positive for Influenza A. I was sent home with a sample of Xofluza. I was in bed for 2 days and symptoms started subsiding. I went back to work the following week.

                                                My arm became quite sore about 8 hours after my initial vaccination.  It was sensitive to the touch to the point that I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body.  It also hurt to raise my arm any higher than shoulder height.  It went away on its own after about 36 hours.  One week later, on January 7th, my husband noticed that I had a large red patch on my arm where I had gotten the vaccination.  It was about 1.5-2&#34; across, raised, red and warm to the touch.  It was slightly itchy, but didn&#39;t hurt.  My husband noticed this in the evening, but I am not sure how long it had been that way since I had had long sleeves on all day.  By the morning, it had gone away.  I didn&#39;t treat it in any way.

After about an hour, my arm was swollen and very painful to move and touch. I put an ice pack on and took Tylenol but the pain and swelling didn?t completely subside. I went to bed with Tylenol PM to help me sleep and woke up several times from the pain. Throughout the day today (2nd day), the pain has steadily gotten worse. I can barely move my arm due to the immense pain. The swelling is still there. I have been icing it and taking Tylenol but the pain has only gotten worse. I feel achy in my neck and the pain is radiating down my arm to my forearm, wrist, and fingers.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

The red areas were swollen, hot to touch, and each were a hard lump a little larger than a marble.  These two spots were about 3 inches below the injection site and an inch closer to the body midline.  These red spots worsened and joined together.  1/28/21 I was still experiencing the red raised area that had grown in size, still hot to the touch and now red and rashy around the outer edge.  Redness diminished over the weekend and resolved by 2/3/21.  Arm and shoulder still are achy and sore.

                                                7 days after receiving the vaccine, I developed intense, deep muscle pain and swelling. The arm where I received the vaccine was very hot to the touch. The next day, I had chills and a mild fever, along with swollen and sore arm. Through the weekend, I developed redness in splotches that were similar to hives in appearance. My arm has been intensely itchy. On Saturday, 2.20.21, the lymph node under my left arm became very swollen and painful. I am currently still experiencing a mildly sore arm (pain has lessened since yesterday), arm is still very hot to the touch, still have red rash/hives and my lymph node is still very painful.

Medical personal on site hooked me up to a blood pressure machine. Tested my sugar. My blood pressure was high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl in my left arm. Symptoms seemed to improve for a few minutes. Then came right back. I was going to pass out so they laid me down and called 911. I was rushed to the Emergency Room. Symptoms persisted and they gave me a shot of ephedrine, steroid, and Pepcid.  I was kept for observation and sent home with two prescriptions. EpiPen&#39;s and steroids. My symptoms persist even to this day. I still do not feel right. My hives have pretty much gone away but I am still feeling off balance and unwell.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

                                                Starting  just a few hours after the immunization I had a red swollen rash around the injection sight, about the size of a nickel. It was painful, but not anymore then a regular flu immunization. I thought I was possibly just reacting to the bandage. However, by the end of the night the redness and swelling had grown to about the size of a silver dollar. The next morning it had swollen to the size of a baseball, was red inflamed and warm to the touch. It only itched when it was touched by something, but was quite sore. I tried some Benadryl cream and took my normal allergy pills I also started using an ice pack trying to keep the heat and swelling down. None of this seemed to help. I also started to feel dizzy and had a headache, normal reactions to immunizations. I did sleep off and on all day this first day after the immunization as I felt weak and dizzy. The swelling just kept getting larger and large no matter what I tried. The second day after the immunization the swelling was around the size of a soft ball, and it was very red, inflamed and almost hot to the touch. Again I used Zyrtec, Benadryl cream and also tried a washcloth soaked with witch hazel, this did not seem to help. Later I went to a friends house and she had some Triamcinolone cream and colloidal silver, I tried both of these and the swelling and warmth did start going down. The redness has stayed about the same (now about the size of a grapefruit). It has started itching, but not constant, and not like my typical allergy itch.

No pain at time of injection. 2.5 hours later, arm started to be sore at site, fever of 101.4, diarrhea x 1 episode. Went outside and fresh air helped, felt much better.  Fatigue and very mild body aches, arm soreness (no more than flu shot, less than tetanus) .  630pm: Acid reflux was the worst side effect I experienced. I asked a co-worker who received the same vaccine the day prior to me. She also had bad reflux. Even with a history of GERD, I do not need to take PPI&#39;s any longer and I needed to take an omeprazole the night of my vaccine, which helped some. Took tylenol 500mg and went to bed. Woke up today (the following day after vaccine feeling normal with arm soreness which got better throughout the day.  I would describe my symptoms as mild. The MD I work with said I should report these to Moderna just so they can track all symptoms that people are experiencing post vaccine.

                                                My upper arm where the injection was administered, started to radiate pain up to my neck. I noticed at that time a painful lump at the front base of neck, right side. The pain started to increase throughout the day. The following morning, the injection site was red and inflamed. The pain persisted throughout the day, radiating  to my hand, all the way up to my neck. The injection site was swollen and red. On a scale of 1 - 10, my pain was at 8. The following day, the pain reached a 10, the swelling and inflammation had increased and I noted decreased muscle strength in my hand. This persisted throughout the night. It&#39;s now Monday morning, and with flexril, constant application of a heating pad, a topical Diclofenac gel, and twice daily dose of 800 mg of Motrin and 2 tyelnol over the course of the last 2 days, my pain is at a 7. The swelling has reduced at the injection site some, but the the redness has increased and so has the hardness of the site.

                                                I have a mark from the vaccine i got as a child.  I think its a smallpox which i received at birth in 1981.  Only around and on that prior vaccination site is a little swollen and very red.  It itches a lot.  It is raised and red.  My vaccination was 2-4 cm cephalad to the mark.   I was ok until Monday morning a week later woke up with it.  Felt fatigued and achy all day following the next day.  Today, 1/12/21, it is still red with a ring around the prior vaccination and fatigue to follow.

Basically it felt like I got hit by a truck later that evening.  Feel very fatigued.

                                                On my 12th minute in the waiting area, I started having itchiness on my legs then it spread to my arms and face. I felt lightheaded and started having difficulty breathing. I approached the paramedic nearby. By then, the itchiness was all over my body from head to toe. They alerted 911 and monitored my vital signs. My 02 sat was 100% and BP was 140/90 mmHg. I asked if I can take Benadryl. They said wait for the ambulance. I declined to go to the hospital unless my symptoms get worse. I then took 25 mg of Benadryl. Shortness of breath and lightheaded ness was slightly relieved but the itchiness was still there. I waited for 30 more minutes in the waiting area. When the itchiness subsided a little bit, I went home. After 3 hours, the itchiness and SOB returned so I called my PCP and I was informed to take Benadryl q4 hrs until symptoms are resolved. As of today, 1/12/21 at 7:18pm, I still have itchiness but not as bad as yesterday.

                                                Client reported tightness when swallowing approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccination, but no shortness of breath or dizziness.  She felt flushing throughout her entire body as well as some tingling. At 7:05 pm, her oxygen saturation was 97% and her blood pressure was 115/80.  She also had red, irregular-shaped  spots on her right, upper arm  (non-vaccinated arm) and upper back.  At 7:13 pm her oxygen saturation was 98% and her heart rate was 111. She then described the tightness when swallowing from earlier as if the muscles in her throat were numbed, which made it hard to swallow, but not hard to breathe. The tightness improved slightly during the 30 minutes that she was observed, but it did not go away. She felt comfortable leaving and knew which signs to look for that would indicate that she needed to seek medical attention.

                                                Pt received first dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/2020. Initial question of whether vaccine was administered correctly - administering nurse never felt arm before administering and did say she thought she gave the injection &#34;too low&#34; and not on deltoid. The nurse mentioned that someone else had gotten a reaction from receiving the dose &#34;too low.&#34; Pt developed a red lump the next day at site of injection.  For first week or so, patient&#39;s symptoms decreased although she still experienced swollen lymph nodes and breast tenderness. Day 8 or 9 (1/6 or 1/7), pt woke up to arm being red, swolen, and sore again. Pt talked to infection control nurse at hospital, who advised her to go to clinic to get it seen by a provider because it looked like it might be cellulitis.  Pt presented 1/7/2021 with complaint of possible infection in right arm where she received the vaccine. Area was red, swollen, warm to the touch. Pt also had some breast tenderness. Pt was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IM x 1 in clnic and discharged.  Pt followed up the next day, 1/8/2021. At that appointment, symptoms had decreased. Redness and firmness of area had decreased and range of motion had increased. Pt continued to endorse soreness that traveled from right side of neck all the way down right elbow, but states it had decreased since 1/7.  1/12/21 pt followed up in clinic and stated arm was much better. Swelling almost gone and erythema much improved. Pt was able to use arm normally. Axilla still a little swollen, but no fever/nausea/vomiting/rash. Pt thinks she had ANA positive in past and c/f collagen vascular disease, in part because she has muscle ache flares for days to weeks.

                                                Started 5 minutes after injection with a bad salty metallic taste in mouth, then wave of heat and lightheadedness. Sweaty and flushed, nauseated, felt like I was going to faint, then tachycardia and shortness of breath. Nurses told me this was a normal reaction, took my vital signs, and watched for everything to return back to normal, and told me I could report experience to VAERS. Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

                                                Within 30 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I started getting a tingling sensation in my lips and cheeks. It lasted approximately one hour. Felt tired the rest of the day. I awoke at around 2am the next morning with diarrhea, extreme chills and bodyaches, and a headache. My right arm was very sore, but I expected that. I went back to bed and awoke for work at 6am. My injection site was red, puffy, and heat to the touch. My body ached as if I had a bad case of the flu. The next morning, I awoke with nausea and vomiting. It lasted until around 9am.  The aches have eased up, but I remain very tired and my injection site is still very red, puffy, and warm to the touch. It feels as if there are knots under the skin.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 EUA Received shot at hospital at 2:30 pm on Jan. 5th.  Had a mildly sore arm that evening and next day at work.  I did notice I had a hard, reddened welt area around injection site, about an inch and half in diameter.  At 8:15 pm on Jan. 6th, I became increasingly achy, and by 9 pm, I could barely stand without my entire body aching.  I took 600 mg of Ibuprofen along with my usual nightly meds of Ambien, Trazodone, and 50 mg benadryl.  It was very hard to sleep that night, as no position was comfortable, and even the weight of the blanket hurt my skin all throughout my body.  I called in sick to work Jan 7th.  I continued to take Ibuprofen and benadryl as directed on the label throughout the day.  Around 4 pm on the 7th, I finally started to feel some relief from the body aches.  My upper left arm remains slightly itchy and has an even larger reddened area now, that measures 3 inches as of today, Jan. 16th.  It remains warm to the touch, and slightly hardened under the skin.  I do have pictures of my arm from January 6th, the day after receiving the injection, but prior to becoming achy, and from today, January 16th, that I would be willing to share.

Was feeling a little tired throughout the day and around 9 pm noticed I was starting to notice some mild flu skin, body aches and headache.  Went to bed around 10 and had slight shivering but figured it was maybe just a low grade fever and covered up with another blanket.  Within 20 minutes I had full blown rigors. My husband had me take a hot shower thinking it might help but it did not. I had uncontrollable shaking for a couple hours then finally fell asleep (I did wake myself up once from shaking). I woke up at 4 am no longer shaking but I had a terrible headache,  my whole body ached and I was wet with sweat. My muscles and joints were so sore I barely was able to walk to the bathroom then went back to sleep. Woke up around 6 (had to get kids up for achool) but I couldn&#39;t so had my husband get them ready. He brought me some acetaminophen and I slept until 11am. Got up and still had body aches and headache but not as bad as in the night. Slept on and off all through the day 1-19-21 taking acetaminophen 2 more times for headache and sore body. Went to bed around 10 pm and woke up back to normal 1-20-21

                                                I received the Moderna vaccination around 10:00am. It was confirmed that it was okay to get the vaccine being that I tested positive for Covid on 12/23/20. Around 19:00 I started to get cold and by midnight I was shivering uncontrollably, I had a fever and had a massive headache. I alternated ibuprofren and Tylenol which did not work. I was only able to sleep from midnight to about 3:00am. The entire day I was shivering with a massive headache. It hurt so bad that I wanted to cry but it hurt worse when I did cry. My highest fever was 101 degrees. My fever broke around 19:00 on 01/05/2021 but the massive headache and body aches lasted the entire week. I felt like I was &#34;hit by a bus&#34; and my entire top part of my arm was in pain . I was seen by a doctor  at HS on Thursday the 7th to have my medical condition documented. My arm felt better by then. She had me take off the rest of the week and to return to work on the 11th. I finally started to feel somewhat better by the 9th

                                                No side effects from first vaccine except soreness to site. This time around I was too lethargic for three days to get out of bed. I had a rash around site that progressed up to the right side of my face and also right side of my lower back the following day. The rash was also accompanied by blotches and is still there only on the side of the injection. I had metallic taste for on and off the first 2-3 days. I am feeling a bit better, well enough to work today. Still very fatigued. On Thursday I also had a 102 fever that Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help me at all at night. I finally stopped sweating yesterday. The blotches are now improving . Only thing that remains is the fatigue.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 08 JAN 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 08 JAN 2021, the patient experienced not sure if she received the full dose, vaccination site too high next to her shoulder bone, bleeding at injection site and extreme pain in her arm that she was not able to lift arm.  Treatment for the events included ibuprofen.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, not sure if she received the full dose and vaccination site was too high next to her shoulder bone were resolved on 08 Jan 2021. The  outcomes of the events, bleeding at injection site and extreme pain in her arm that she was not able to lift her arm, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case a 39-year-old patient who experienced events of incorrect dose administration, vaccination site too high next to her shoulder bone, bleeding at injection site and extreme pain in her arm that she was not able to lift her arm for mRNA-127 (Lot number 012L20A, Exp date-unknown). Based on temporal the information provided and the absence of any other etiology factors a causal association between the events of bleeding at injection site and extreme pain in her arm that she was not able to lift her arm and vaccine administration cannot be excluded. The other events of vaccinated way too high and incomplete dose administered are assessed as not applicable

Upon returning to work in the pharmacy, she sat down at her desk and noted her HR to be 159 via her Apple watch. She felt slightly lightheaded, so returned to  Auditorium for monitoring. On arrival, she complained only of high HR, no other symptoms. We checked her VS: BP 140/78, HR 132, RR 20, SaO2 94. She denied chest pain or SOB. We monitored her for about 15 minutes, and her HR decreased to 103-110. We monitored her for another 15 minutes or so, at which time her HR spiked again to 132, and she felt heavy in her chest and tight in her throat. At that point, we moved her to a gurney and called a Rapid Response. We administered 50mg of Benadryl IM per protocol, foregoing the Epinephrine, due to her tachycardic state. The Rapid Response team arrived and she was transported to the ED for evaluation. She maintained consciousness and was A&amp;Ox3 the entire time.

I called the cardiologist and she was not surprised and said I could take double the dose of my meds for 1-2 days and to do the same on the second dose. I felt much better the next day.   Appx 8 days after the injection I developed a 2 in halo of inflamed skin, redness, and itchiness. I took Benadryl and it improved but returned today (day 9). It is mild and I will continue to watch this. It is similar to my flu shot reaction though delayed one week rather than immediate.

On 3/16/21 I had low grade fever (99.6), chills, body aches as expected. Then on 3/17/21 my water broke.  Amnisure and ER exam confirmed PPROM at 15 weeks. I was admitted for observation then discharged after 24 hours. I remain on bedrest at home and the fluids have stopped leaking.   Of note,  I am a physician, and I was diagnosed with COVID about a year ago, 3/2020 with mild symptoms. Fever, severe headache, and mild shortness of breath lasted about 2 weeks. I continued to test positive for 5 more weeks before tests were negative.
