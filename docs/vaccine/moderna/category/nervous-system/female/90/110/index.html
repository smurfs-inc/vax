                                                Caretaker at Facility contacted me to tell me that this morning, patients left arm is red and raised all the way to the elbow and very painful. Patient gets scheduled ibuprofen for arthritis which is helping.  She has had no other problems with other vaccinations including flu shot Fall 2020. Denies SOB, swollen tongue or throat, or rash/red areas anywhere else on body. Wondering if getting vaccine 3-1/2 months after getting COVID may be reason she is reacting. Caretaker anticipates she will recover just fine but is concerned about giving 2nd shot of series.

                                                Patient became incoherent for a few seconds while sitting in a chair in the observation area. Pharmacy manager went to observe patient and ask how she was feeling. Patient&#39;s head started to droop to the side for a few second and her shoulders made shrugging movements for a few seconds. During this time I called 911, while individual waited with the patient seated in the chair. Patient became more coherent in a few seconds and could speak and smile normally. Ambulance came and patient went with paramedics.

Patient states she received her 2nd dose of her Moderna COVID 19 vaccine yesterday (3/3/21).  She states she went to bed, woke up in generalized shaking which has yet to stop that she came to the ER (on 3/4/21).  In ER patient&#39;s initial blood work was unremarkable which include CMP and CBC.  CT brain was done to rule out any underlying neurological deficits or acute CVA which was unremarkable.  She denies any numbness tingling no blurry vision no headache no sensory motor deficits.  She denies any recent falls.

                                                On Saturday morning, Mar 6th had erratic racing heart beat and high to very low blood pressure, 168/  , low 88/51, afib, unsteady, lightheaded, hot and chilled, headache, very weak. On 8:10am Sunday, heart beat ranged from 50 to 125 bpm, blood pressure dropped to 90/64. Doctor took me off all meds except Xarelto, said stay in bed, drink lots of fluids. I did not connect the symtoms to the vaccine at the time because problems happened after the 1st few hours, and I was too sick to think clearly. It was only when I read the side effects after 1-3 days, that I realized it could be from the vaccine. I worry about being deathly sick after the second vaccine shot, so I&#39;m reporting this.

Front in the ribs and around the breast - chest pains.  Exhausted - energy is gone. Can&#39;t do normal activities that she was able to do prior to vaccine.  Sharp pains. When I breath or cough/sneeze or laugh it hurts. Had some relief from heat and cold packs.  Left knee has hurt a lot since this happened, too.

She was old but extremely cognizant, independent, healthy, strong of sound mind.  This is why I am reporting it. If she dies I will report again.

                                                The patient came to the Emergency Room at approx 3:30 am on 02/03/2021 with pain in right arm (same arm the COVID vaccine had been administered in approx 12 hours earlier) and feeling generally unwell. Patient was concerned about possibility of gout flare or that something was wrong with her arm. Elevated blood pressure was noted; this was attributed to anxiety. She was evaluated, given 500 mg Tylenol, and discharged since the pain was decreasing and blood pressure was stabilized. Patient instructed to follow-up with physician.  The next day,  on 02/04/2021, the patient arrived at the Emergency Room by ambulance; cardiac arrest was the chief complaint. The patient&#39;s daughter stated the patient had been &#34;feeling generally poor and then suddenly collapsed.&#34; Daughter described &#34;gurgling respirations&#34; and being unresponsive. 911 was called, police arrived within 5 minutes and initiated CPR. Epinephrine, atropine, lidocaine and bicarb administered after arrival to Emergency Room.  Shockable rhythm never demonstrated. Patient never recovered spontaneous respiration or movement.   The death was called at 23:04. Coronary artery disease with cardiac arrest is the cause from the ER records; the coroner is putting COVID-19 vaccination in Part 1 of the death certificate.

I thought she was having a stroke so rushed her to the emergency room. They examined her and her speech returned to normal in about an hour. They kept her overnight for tests and after an MRI they said she had a TIA. We wanted to report it in case there were others who had a similar adverse affect. No one can say for sure if the vaccine caused it or not but we wanted to let you know what happened to her.

The EMT and paramedic summoned me and after arriving at the observation area  and ascertaining the patient&#39;s symptoms i asked the medic to administer the .3ml of epinephrine via EpiPen which he then did. Responding paramedics then arrived and took over assessment and treatment of the patient.  An ambulance had previously been called and the patient remained stable with slight improvement in the sense that she became less anxious and frightened.  She exhibited no urticaria or angioedema.  Vital signs included initial B/P of 183/95 with improvement to 176/76 and 99% pulse ox .  Patient was transported to hospital and per daughter was released about 2 hours later.

She woke up early in the morning yesterday and had a pressure like sensation in her head, she still has that today.  She still has burning sensation in her chest, and her legs and ankles are hurting still.   She has taken some Tylenol for the aches and pains.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the  Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (left-arm), my mother began to have moderate pain in her left arm, particularly in the left shoulder area. The pain continued to increase throughout the afternoon, until it became so severe (10 on a 10-point pain scale) by 8:30 pm on 3/10/21 , that she could no longer lift her arm. She took 500 mg of Tylenol to attempt to relive the pain and went to bed early.   At 2:45 am on 3/11/21, she needed to go to the restroom, and I (daughter) had to assist her to get out of bed, as she had no use of her left arm due to severe pain in that arm. While seated on the toilet, she indicated that her arm was extremely painful and she felt that she was going to pass out and felt nauseated. Within a minute, she lost consciousness and  I called emergency services. EMT arrived within 5 minutes and stated that her blood pressure was extremely low and she needed to be placed on the floor.  They placed her on a gurney and took her to the ambulance, where they started an IV and took her to her local hospital.  I followed shortly thereafter, where she was taken to the ER. She was admitted to the hospital for observation and given Ativan (she refused any opioids) She was ultimately diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the pain in her left arm. Two days later, the pain has subsided.

Uncertain how long it will continue. Severe whole body edema beginning day five. Particularly pronounced in L arm that received Moderna Vaccine. Also aches in Left shoulder, and whole body muscle aches. She has had some edema in her lower legs and feet, but NEVER in her hands, face and torso. In retrospect, we should have avoided using her left arm to vaccinate due to lymph node removal.

                                                She got the vaccine and started out with nausea below the vomiting point, and she could not eat much and had stomach upset.  She did not feel well.  She went to bed for a whole day and then slept the following day.  It is still going on but not quite as bad, very tired.  The arm was a little sore the night of the vaccine, but when she started using the arm the feeling left.  Did have some soreness for a couple of nights.  She can still hardly eat, but her stomach feels better.  She has the bad feeling where she cannot eat but a few bites as she gets nauseated then.  She has not taken anything for her symptoms.  She is just not feeling well at all as if you don&#39;t want to be out of bed.  It&#39;s a big struggle for her to get up and get her something to eat.  Something that she doesn&#39;t have to cook.

Pupils reactive, but sluggish. Probable CVA. Dr. and family were notified. Family wished to keep patient at hospital and provide comfort care rather than send to the hospital. MD was in agreement. APNP, assessed patient. Her tongue was red and swollen. Bite marks noted on right side of tongue likely d/t event. ST evaluation done to evaluate patient&#39;s ability to chew and swallow safely due to swelling of tongue. Hospice services were initiated. (Unsure if event was caused by vaccine administration)

                                                Patient was awakened by itchiness on left arm from elbow to wrist. Increased in severity to feeling as though on fire and being bitten by a thousand mosquitoes. Spread to other arm, both becoming bright red and blotchy. Some areas became raised. The itchy red began to creep up to injection site. Next day, February 21, legs began to ache, swell, and itch. Developed bright red, splotchy hives similar to arms spreading from knees to ankles before creeping up thighs. Large, hard, itchy area behind both ankles, and navel also became inflamed and itchy. Today (March 1) arms and legs are still red, though it has faded in some areas, and the itchiness is persistent but has subsided.

                                                Pt received 2nd dose of Moderna too early.   On 03/12/2021 when health dept nurse learned of the error, the patient was called to assess for any problems and to determine if the doses were given too early.  RN  said the patient was hard to understand and a poor historian.  Pt could not give names of caregivers.  RN  had EMS go by to provide a welfare check. EMS reported pt was at baseline health status.  EMS staff spoke with nephew who reported pt has only had one vaccine.  On 03/15/2021, RN  received calls from step daughter-in-law and Nephew, both advising pt did get both vaccines. Per family, the patient?s vaccine appointments were not communicated well between the family caregivers.  One caretaker thought the 2/24/2021 trip to health dept was just to register and the second trip on 03/05/2021 was when the actual vaccine was to be given.  Registration forms were completed at each visit, with both showing no previous vaccine administered.  Pt and family report no side effects after the 1st vaccine, the nephew did report noticing that the patient was lethargic and weak 3 d after the 2nd vaccine. Family was advised the patient does not need another dose of COVID vaccine at this time, 2 dose series complete.

                                                Narrative:  Patient received dose 1 of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/11/21 from clinic. Vaccine was administered to patient without complications and patient was observed for 15 minutes post-vaccination without any adverse effects. No documentation as to any adverse effects following the 15 minutes post-vaccination. 11 days later on 3/22/21, EMS was dispatched to patient&#39;s home and patient was found lying supine, unconscious, and unresponsive to stimuli. Patient was noted to have shallow breathing per EMS staff, and was subsequently brought to the hospital. Per family, patient lives alone and was feeling well - they had spoken to her two days prior to the event. Per family patient did not have recent fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, or cough. Also no recent medication changes or trauma. PMH includes stroke approx. 8 years ago, gout, HLD, HTN, and RLS. BP upon admission was 126/93, HR 123, temp 37.1 degrees Celcius, RR 28. Patient noted to smell of urine. CT showed large completed right sided infarct consistent with MCA stroke. Per neurology the lesion was not recoverable and patient would be unlikely to regain any function. Family was notified and poor prognosis was discussed. Patient has been very clear in the past that she would prefer &#34;to go when her time came&#34;. She had a DNR And DNI as well. Daughter requested to pursue comfort measures for patient, therefore she was transferred to hospice care. Patient passed away the following day on 3/23/21. Death very unlikely due to COVID-19 vaccination since CT imaging clearly showed cerebral infarct and patient had a PMH of stroke.
