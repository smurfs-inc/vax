                                                Caretaker at Facility contacted me to tell me that this morning, patients left arm is red and raised all the way to the elbow and very painful. Patient gets scheduled ibuprofen for arthritis which is helping.  She has had no other problems with other vaccinations including flu shot Fall 2020. Denies SOB, swollen tongue or throat, or rash/red areas anywhere else on body. Wondering if getting vaccine 3-1/2 months after getting COVID may be reason she is reacting. Caretaker anticipates she will recover just fine but is concerned about giving 2nd shot of series.

The event, vaccine administered at inappropriate site, was considered recovered/resolved on 02 Feb 2021  The event, redness was considered recovering/resolving.   The events, swelling and tenderness, was considered not recovered/not resolved.  The outcome of the event, tenderness, was unknown/ not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of product administered at inappropriate site for mRNA-1273, (lot # 007M20A) with associated injection site erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the injection site events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                TIA diagnosis at hospital; Conscious after fall; Dizzy/ lightheadedness; Head bump (temple area and ear caused by hit sink during fall); A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 90-years-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced transient ischemic attack, fall, dizzy lightheadedness, and a head bump.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included transient ischemic attack; the patient experienced 3 events in 2020.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 030L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 25 Jan 2021, the patient experienced dizzy lightheadedness and a fall, resulting in a head bump in her temple and ear caused by hitting the sink as she fell. The patient was hospitalized following the fall and diagnosed with transient ischemic attack.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient received magnetic resonance imaging and a laboratory test.  On 27 Jan 2021, the lightheadedness and head bump had resolved.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not reported.   The outcome of the events, transient ischemic attack and fall, was considered resolved on 25 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, lightheadedness and head bump, was considered resolved on 27 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 90-years-old female patient with a relevant medical history of three TIA within last year, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Dizziness and Transient ischaemic attack and non-serious unexpected events of Fall and Head injury.  The events of occurred approximately 2 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 030L20A. Treatment details were not provided.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s advanced age and prior history of TIA are considered significant confounders.

                                                The patient came to the Emergency Room at approx 3:30 am on 02/03/2021 with pain in right arm (same arm the COVID vaccine had been administered in approx 12 hours earlier) and feeling generally unwell. Patient was concerned about possibility of gout flare or that something was wrong with her arm. Elevated blood pressure was noted; this was attributed to anxiety. She was evaluated, given 500 mg Tylenol, and discharged since the pain was decreasing and blood pressure was stabilized. Patient instructed to follow-up with physician.

I thought she was having a stroke so rushed her to the emergency room. They examined her and her speech returned to normal in about an hour. They kept her overnight for tests and after an MRI they said she had a TIA. We wanted to report it in case there were others who had a similar adverse affect. No one can say for sure if the vaccine caused it or not but we wanted to let you know what happened to her.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination the patient began to feel a tightness in the throat and difficulty speaking with a sense of anxiety and fright.  The EMT and paramedic summoned me and after arriving at the observation area  and ascertaining the patient&#39;s symptoms i asked the medic to administer the .3ml of epinephrine via EpiPen which he then did. Responding paramedics then arrived and took over assessment and treatment of the patient.  An ambulance had previously been called and the patient remained stable with slight improvement in the sense that she became less anxious and frightened.  She exhibited no urticaria or angioedema.  Vital signs included initial B/P of 183/95 with improvement to 176/76 and 99% pulse ox .  Patient was transported to hospital and per daughter was released about 2 hours later.

She states that any time she takes a step down (not up), she feels very dizzy.  She has started using a cane because of this which she is dissatisfied with.  This started after she got the second dose on the 10th of March, and has been continual for her since then.  She is not our patient and we do not have any real information about her except that she received both of her doses from the Health Department.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the  Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (left-arm), my mother began to have moderate pain in her left arm, particularly in the left shoulder area. The pain continued to increase throughout the afternoon, until it became so severe (10 on a 10-point pain scale) by 8:30 pm on 3/10/21 , that she could no longer lift her arm. She took 500 mg of Tylenol to attempt to relive the pain and went to bed early.   At 2:45 am on 3/11/21, she needed to go to the restroom, and I (daughter) had to assist her to get out of bed, as she had no use of her left arm due to severe pain in that arm. While seated on the toilet, she indicated that her arm was extremely painful and she felt that she was going to pass out and felt nauseated. Within a minute, she lost consciousness and  I called emergency services. EMT arrived within 5 minutes and stated that her blood pressure was extremely low and she needed to be placed on the floor.  They placed her on a gurney and took her to the ambulance, where they started an IV and took her to her local hospital.  I followed shortly thereafter, where she was taken to the ER.

                                                My mother fainted on the night she was vaccinated, early in the morning. She had gone to the kitchen to get a heating pad and felt faint while standing  She didn&#39;t make it to a chair, but fell and broke her hip.   While this could have been due to another health problem, my mother had never had a fall or a near-fall. it is concerning that very old adults are not warned to have someone with them after receiving the vaccine (for instance, overnight),  I realize that the vaccine has not been studied specifically in geriatric populations, but it is realistic to assume that there are substantial numbers of very old people living on their own, particularly in cities where there is no need to drive, and where food and other necessities can be delivered. There should be a warning to people that they should not be alone after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Narrative:  Patient received dose 1 of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/11/21 from clinic. Vaccine was administered to patient without complications and patient was observed for 15 minutes post-vaccination without any adverse effects. No documentation as to any adverse effects following the 15 minutes post-vaccination. 11 days later on 3/22/21, EMS was dispatched to patient&#39;s home and patient was found lying supine, unconscious, and unresponsive to stimuli. Patient was noted to have shallow breathing per EMS staff, and was subsequently brought to the hospital. Per family, patient lives alone and was feeling well - they had spoken to her two days prior to the event. Per family patient did not have recent fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, or cough. Also no recent medication changes or trauma. PMH includes stroke approx. 8 years ago, gout, HLD, HTN, and RLS. BP upon admission was 126/93, HR 123, temp 37.1 degrees Celcius, RR 28. Patient noted to smell of urine. CT showed large completed right sided infarct consistent with MCA stroke. Per neurology the lesion was not recoverable and patient would be unlikely to regain any function. Family was notified and poor prognosis was discussed. Patient has been very clear in the past that she would prefer &#34;to go when her time came&#34;. She had a DNR And DNI as well. Daughter requested to pursue comfort measures for patient, therefore she was transferred to hospice care. Patient passed away the following day on 3/23/21. Death very unlikely due to COVID-19 vaccination since CT imaging clearly showed cerebral infarct and patient had a PMH of stroke.

                                                Patient became lethargic, extremely tired, unable to care well for self.  Patient had no appetite, refused most food and spent many hours simply sitting in her chair.  She felt that she was having a heart attack and called 911 using her emergency response button on 2/21/2021.  Doctors indicated that the patient&#39;s life was in serious danger, but because of age they were hesitant to try to remove the clot pressing on her heart.  She was only allowed to go back home because we utilized Hospice.  When asked about her life expectancy, we were told she could die any minute or might live a few more months, but that she was not expected to live much longer.  SHE WAS IN GOOD HEALTH PRIOR TO THE IMMUNIZATION!
