                                                Developed a severe headache within 2-3 hours of receiving vaccine. Took 2 Tylenol. Headache abated but did not resolve. Within the next 2-3 hours felt tingling in my left upper lip. It grew worse and headache worsened. Lip felt like it was swelling but no change was seen. Then left side of face began to ache. Took 2 more Tylenol. Texted my primary care physician who recommended Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Took Benadryl about 4:30 or 5:00.  Left work and went home. Had severe headache. Took my blood pressure. It was 185/68. Had some old Propanolol 10 mg from 2 years earlier and took one and a Prednisone 10mg. By 9:00 pm still felt bad with facial pain and tingling. BP decreased to 148/89. Took another Benadryl and went to bed. Face ant lip better in the morning. Arm sore for 2 days. Developed body and joint aches for the past 2-3 days. Slowly resolving.

                                                Within about 2 days a round red sore appeared on my left arm just below my elbow.  Each day it became more sore and inflamed.  Within one week it became filled with puss, erupted, bled and now seems to be filling with puss again.  Now, within the last 2-3 days the injection site has suddenly developed a large red patch of mildly itchy irritation surrounding the site, with one or two other small patches starting to appear nearby.  During the last few days I have also notice a dull pain coming and going in my left arm.  Using my cell phone, I have taken photos of the sore in 3 stages and of the red injection area.  Those photos could be submitted to my doctor or this office, via text, if helpful.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post-vaccination patient called for staff saying she felt lightheaded.  Staff arrived and moved patient to floor,  head supported by patient&#39;s jacket.  We placed her feet above head (in a chair).  Upon questioning patient about her history with vaccines, patient stated she had had a similar reaction with blood draws, but not with a vaccine.  Patient also stated she is borderline diabetic and had only eaten a small bowl of cereal this morning and not had lunch yet.  Patient stated she was feeling better, we sat her up and she drank a bottle of orange juice.  Patient monitored for another 15 minutes, felt well and was escorted to her to her apartment and she claimed she felt well.  Patient instructed to call her PCP, 911, or go to the nearest emergency emergency room for any additional issues.

                                                Five minutes after the vaccine was injected, I became dizzy, my eyes teared and face swelled up and throat tightened.  The EMT&#39;s came, checked my lungs, etc.  and talked me through the episode which lasted about 15 minutes.  Then the swelling subsided.  I suspect it had, because I had dermal fillers approximately a year ago.  I had no other adverse affects, except for tiredness that evening.  People should be warned about this because it is a frightening event.  I have never had an adverse reaction to a vaccine before.

Today 1/22/21, 8 days later, I woke up with my left arm sore at the vaccine site and when I looked, I found a bright red circle about 2&#34; in diameter around the site.  It is not hot to touch or sore - just a little itchy.  Since the vaccination I have used no ointments or lotions on my arm, have done the same exercise each day, and have had no bump or accident to my arm.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Ten days after the injection of Covid 19 injection my arm swelled up, and became very red and itchy at the site of the injection.  It just came up out of nowhere it seems as I had no reaction at all to the vaccine during the prior 10 days since the vaccination. This continued for two days.  The first day after it happened I felt tired and weak in the morning.  I got into work here at the house and the weakness went away.  I treated the itchy situation with Clobetasol Propionate Cream which I had here and was prescribed by my dermatologist for poison ivy.  That took away the itchy situation that was very annoying.  Two days into it the swelling began to go down.  Today is the 4th day since the problem occurred and there is no swelling and only a slight redness.  I am assuming that I can take injection #2 on February 9 as scheduled.

It has stayed sore since then, Yesterday it was bothering me so I looked and noticed there was knot about the size bigger the a dime but smaller then a quarter.  Slightly red area the injection site and has been itching. Feels warm to touch. I haven&#39;t really bad or anything. Since Saturday I have been trouble with my stomach which isn&#39;t anything unusual. It seems like it is upset.

                                                My arm wasn&#39;t sore right away but I think I laid on it and the next morning it was sore. It felt like a bee sting I took some medicine and it went away.  On the 27th I had bad gas. I did try a new cereal and thought it was cereal. On the 28th I still gas and upset stomach like flu like symptoms  and felt light headed but not bad. On the 29th still an upset stomach and had diarrhea, I was still light headed and really shaky. I was really weak. I was shaking a lot at arms (hands) and legs were both shaking  and made it hard to walk. On the 30th I still really light headed and my legs and hands were still shaky, still having difficulty walking, still had an upset stomach and still felt weak. On the 31st my stomach was a lot better, I was still shaky and light headed, and I had a weak feeling. My head felt like when you feel like you have a head cold (pressure in my head). Today my stomach is better, I am still lightheaded and still shaky but not as bad. I still feel pressure in my head, but no runny nose or any other cold symptoms.   These were symptoms I had in March when I was sick for 3 weeks. I was negative for COVID but didn&#39;t get back to my normal self until the June.   Doctor was a private practice and recently closed so I do not see my new doctor till the 24th.

                                                Patient said the day of the vaccination she developed a red patch about 1/2 inch in diameter that was red and swollen and a little tender. Patient reported that it was periodically itchy and she has been scratching it. She stated that yesterday (day 9 after vaccination) that she noticed the size of the redness had increased. She said it was still periodically itchy and only slightly tender to the touch. She said she felt otherwise fine no systemic effects reported. Patient had not taken anything. Recommended benadryl and icing the area. Treatment outcome unknown at this time.

I was uneasy  and thought I might fall.  I slept another three hours and went to the bathroom again. I felt a little better. I got up in about two more hours and felt a little better. Didn?t feel good all day and my arm was really sore.

She was tossing and looked like she was trying to get up. He was talking to her and she wasn?t answering him. She was having trouble breathing. Took her to the hospital right away at 7:30 pm. They put her into a comma with a respirator. Finally went from emergency room to ICU on Monday. Then on Wednesday they took the respirator out and I spoke to her ? told her we all love her and she could only say hoarsely ?terrible, terrible.? They said she might get moved to regular floor. But then Wednesday night couldn?t breathe again and put the respirator back in. Thursday morning husband had it removed and she died that evening at 10:51 on February 25.

Usually I have a path of Z&#39;s going left to right and then at my age I had  a very slight headache. These looked different with broken up lights. and I woke up with them.Then on Feb 24  :1t 1:15 I had my second. The next morning I woke up with a hazy eyesight but I thought it might be a migraine. I somehow knew it wasn&#39;t but didn&#39;t go to a doctor. The next morning definitely knew.  Saw 2 doctors one in emergency situation he placed me on steroids but I had lost part of my eye sight.

Pain bad enough Wednesday night/Thursday early morning to contact Dr. Thursday. He determined my pain was muscle pain. Suggested Aleve (as Tylenol and Advil weren&#39;t working) and heating pad (which I had used on Wednesday during day). Aleve helped a lot. Pain by today (Sunday) is minimal but still some minimal discomfort.

                                                This event , because so many elderly people have the fillers in their knees should be widely publicized! We have fillers that help so much to be able to walk without pain, but this vaccine has caused me to have extreme pain and burning and not be able to walk without pain for 4 days now. NO ONE has said anything about how this Moderna vaccine would  affect us because of the Hyaronolic Acid injections to our knees. We should have been allowed to get Pfizer!!!! I am so upset about this and extremely disappointed in our government&#39;s lack of disclosure.

                                                I had Covid on 25 Nov. 2020.  I had extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, aching, headaches and abdominal pain. I have IBS which flared up during this time.  It took me December and January to finally get over the fatigue part. When I received my vaccination on Feb. 12, 2021 (Moderna) by that evening I began to run a temp. of 102-103. I had chills, headache, abdominal pain (worse than in Nov.), fatigue, some dizziness, and short of breath. I felt like I had Covid all over again!  I was down for 5 days. On Sunday afternoon, Feb 14 I went to the Clinic to see the doctor on call.  I was told they could not test me since I had Covid November 25 and it hadn&#39;t been 90 days and I would still have the antibodies.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 20 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273(Lot number:039K20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20 Jan 2021, the patient experienced soreness in arm immediately after receiving the shot. The soreness resolved few days later.  On 29 Jan 2021, Lab work done due to her being anemic and on perpetual oxygen therapy. Her hemoglobin level went down from 8.8 to 8.2 and her oxygen level was 82 on exertion.   On 31 Jan 2021, the patient started experiencing shortness of breath. Patient stated that her saturation level was at 82 percent whenever she is standing up or walking and she runs out of breath. When she sits down, the level of the oxygen will go up. She said she is not sure if her medical condition is getting worse or if this is vaccine related  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, sore arm, oxygen level at 82 percent when walking, and hemoglobin went from 8.8 to 8.2 were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information from the source document that the patient is an anemic patient on perpetual oxygen, the events of oxygen saturation decreased, hemoglobin decreased and dyspnea on exertion is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. The event of pain in extremity is possibly related. Further information has been requested.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, stated she was sneezing and coughing few days before receiving her first dose vaccine. Concomitant medications reported included iron, metolazone, nicardipine, simvastatin, torsemide, levothyroxine, glimepiride, apixaban, potassium chloride, acetyl salicylic acid, and donepezil 5mg.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 032L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The route of administration was not provided.

On 25 Jan 2021, the patient was losing her balance and confused. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with renal failure, as well as, severe urinary tract infection that was septic.  On an unknown date post hospitalization, the patient tested positive for Covid-19.  Treatment drug administered included Tylenol, Azithromycin, Promethazine, 325mg aspirin, and Vitamin D.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, like not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, confusion, loss of balance, renal failure, severe urinary tract infection that was septic, and Covid-19 positive test were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the event of COVID-19.  The event of COVID-19 is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain virus capable of causing infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-033912:

She cannot recall words and is experiencing delirium. Both her internist and her neurologist are convinced it was the result of the vaccine e. She had a complete Nueromosych evaluation done two months ago snd the results were completed normal.  I want you to be aware of this snd if it does not resolve I may sue the federal government and moderna. Thanks a llot

Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

I could not even turn over in bed without my  whole body hurting. I don?t know if I had a fever or not.  I was so tired, but shaking with chills and body hurting I couldn?t go to sleep.  Put more blankets on and took 2 Tylenol.  I was able to eventually go to sleep.  I felt better in the morning but was very tired during the day.   It felt like I had covid again.  I had the same symptoms then.  I tested positive for covid November 27 at a rehab/nursing home where I was sent  after foot surgery.

By 7pm I was dizzy and nauseated, and it got worse, I got chills and shook and shook and shook, I had a fever and the next day I tried to get out of bed, and I fell to the floor and couldn?t stand up, I had no energy or appetite. I had covid in August 2020 and the wasn?t made aware of the possible side effects if you had covid. They didn?t ask if I had covid in the past and the pharmacist told me later that people who has had covid has reported having bad side effects. I had gone a couple weeks ago to see if I had the covid antibodies and I was positive for antibodies and the injection works against the antibiotics. This part of the procedure was overlooked. I have no one else to help me and going through this alone, it would have been better to have been made aware of this ahead of time.

                                                Admitted to hospital for acute on chronic respiratory failure following covid vaccination.  (patient significantly fatigued, slept most of the day after vaccine, not on BIPAP as needed)  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  patient is a 78 y.o. female with a history of oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and persistent atrial fibrillation who presents today with general malaise.  She received her 2nd COVID-19 vaccination yesterday and complained of fatigue, body aches, and general malaise all day.  Later in the evening she noticed that her blood oxygen level was low.  She denies having any more shortness of breath abnormal.  She has had no vomiting, headache, or chest pain.  On arrival she was noted to be febrile and required 6 L supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  She usually uses 2 L nasal cannula at baseline, occasionally increasing it to 3 or 4 with exertion.  She also had elevated troponin levels and noted leukocytosis.  There was radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.  On exam, she is tired and wants to go to sleep.  She is still requiring 4 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.  Her daughter is at bedside.  Plans are discussed for admission and she is agreeable.   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: * Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Admit to medicine- hypoxic requiring 6 L nasal cannula, utilizes 2 L nasal cannula baseline Hypoxia appears to be secondary to robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccination Increased hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis, elevated troponin, radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure Will repeat troponin level in the morning, daily chemistry and blood count, will treat congestive heart failure as below     CHF (congestive heart failure) (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Transesophageal echocardiogram from October 2020 noted preserved left ejection fraction, and had no evidence for diastolic dysfunction Radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure, normal BNP, elevated troponin with an increase of 18 at the 2 hour mark, will recheck in the morning As this is her 2nd hospitalization since that echo with hypoxia and concern for CHF, will obtain repeat echocardiogram Received 80 mg IV Lasix in the emergency department, will continue 40 mg IV Lasix 2 times a day Daily weights, 2 L fluid restriction Patient was admitted with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. I think this is due to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure that was brought on after she was sleeping most of the day without her BiPAP. She says she got her COVID-19 booster shot and felt so tired she slept all day. She did not think she needed her BiPAP during the day even if she was sleeping. She has not had a recent sleep study. Patient is diuresing and will likely be able to discharge tomorrow.

                                                6:13 pm - 9 pm   Extreme shooting pain, right shoulder, clavicle and neck causing my arm to jerk and sometimes my body spasmed. Pain was intermittent, coming and going but taking my breath away. I called CVS about aspirin and took 5 Baby Bayer aspirins. Pain went away at around 9 pm. Never returned. NO  other adverse effects  Surprising result is diminished pain in knees! When it gets cold, rainy, my knees have been extremely painful so I&#39;d have to lift myself up from sitting but since then the pain is at 1 to 2 on the scale rather than 10 ! It sounds strange but it has happened and that&#39;s why I felt I needed to report this.  Rainy days this week with no debilitating pain and I waited to report this for a week since the pain usually began days before.

On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 05 Jan 2021, the patient woke up real sweaty at 3 am. She got up and went to the bathroom and passed out. The patient reported that she fell on the commode then got to the floor because she felt weak and could not walk. Once she regained her strength, she returned to bed.   On 07 Jan 2021, the patient reported that her arm was still sore at the injection site and continued to feel weak. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The events, passed out, sweaty, and couldn&#39;t walk were considered resolved on 06 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, felt weak and arm still sore at the left arm injection site, were considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 80-year-old female patient  with unknown medical history, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Loss of consciousness, the non-serious listed event of Injection site pain, and the non-serious unlisted events of Asthenia, Hyperhidrosis, and Gait disturbance.

SUBSIDED OVER A PERIOD OF 72&#43; HOURS.  1 WEEK LATER THE SEVERE SORE/STIFF SITUATION REAPPEARED, COULD NOT TAKE MY NIGHTGOWN OFF THE NEXT MORNING AND COULD NOT PUT A SEATBELT ON OR DRIVE, DRY MYSELF AFTER A SHOWER, ETC.... THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

                                                very bad pain from head to toe in every muscle, bone and joint, nausea, weakness, freezing cold and the worst was from about 10 pm feb 18 to about 11 am feb 19 but the weakness went on through feb 20.  Felt pretty much over it by Feb 21 but still some weakness and fatigue.  Also a very sore arm that turned pink and feb 22 is still sore and pink and itchy but not as bad as the previous days.  I have always gotten a sore arm with flu shots but not as bad as this time so I didn&#39;t consider that a bad reaction.

She waited and as she was leaving she fell to the floor and hit her head.  The other patients around her said it looked like she slipped, but when speaking to her it seemed that she had become dizzy and fell.  I spoke with her after she fell, she did not loose conscienceness, but was disoriented.  She did know what day it was, who she was and where she was.  She said her head hurt and she could move all her limbs.  I asked the store director, to call for an ambulance.  I sit with her for a few minutes and talked to her, then asked store director to stay with her until the ambulance arrived.  They arrived and spoke with her and decided to transport her to the hospital.  Later that day, her sister in law came by and said she was doing fine and had been released.

                                                Patient came with husband to Vaccine clinic today 3/5 for 2nd dose of vaccine. Did well during and immediately after vaccine. Husband states patient has c/o severe chest pressure and pain for several weeks but has refused to come to ER for evaluation. Today, after getting vaccine dose and going to local bank, patient was in passenger side of truck when chest pain started again. Husband begged patient to let him take her to the ER but she said no, I?m fine and I don?t want to go. She then went unresponsive. At a stop light, he was next to a couple of cops who he was able to wave down and proceed to escort them in to ER. Upon arrival to the ER, patient was unresponsive and pulseless. CPR was initiated, 1 defib, and 1mg of epi was given. Return of pulse was obtained, but husband asked for no life support and only comfort measures. Patient was admitted for comfort measures.  I do NOT think this was related to her vaccine, but rather the unfortunately end to a sub-acute chest pain patient that declined multiple urgings to seek care.  Patient then expired on 3/5/21 at 2037.

                                                Was napping the day after receiving the vaccine and woke up about 3:00 pm to severe chest pain on the right side radiating deep into the shoulder blade.  It would last about 5 - 10 min., stop for the same amount of time, then start up again.... on &amp; off until close to 11:00 pm.   Since someone else I know had the same thing happen the day after her shot, I assumed I had the same symptom, tho&#39; it was very frightening.  A week later after going to bed on Friday night, I woke at 2:00 a.m. to the same pain only this time on my left side.  Thinking I could be having a heart attack, I went to the hospital where I was admitted after having a series of tests.  I was there for 2 days during which time I also began to have un-controllable diarrhea.  Altho&#39; they could find nothing wrong with my heart,  after scans, x-rays, a stress test, numerous blood tests etc., they cannot say positively whether or not it was from the Covid vaccine.  I tho&#39;t it best to report this in case others have similar events.  I had the MODERNA vaccine

                                                The patient presented with hyperkinetic jerking movements of her bilateral upper extremities. This occurred a few days after her 2nd Moderna COVID dose. She has CKD although her renal function was at baseline on hospital admission. Gabapentin was discontinued. By the next morning, the jerking movements stopped. It is unknown if this was due to gabapentin vs the vaccine.

The second day she shaking and jerking, couldn&#39;t hold on to anything.  Her blood pressure was up and down that day. She said she felt like she was dying and then she vomiting where she bruised both elbows on the toilet bowl due to the jerking movement she was experiencing.  She took a nap and woke up confused.  She was hallucinating saying she felt like she went from a small box to a blue box to red box and didnt recognize her room.  Her sitter said her eyes were glazed but was able to recognize her sitter at that time.  Blood pressure dropped so the sitter then called EMTs where they checked her out.  Vital signs were good but she declined to be transported to the hospital via ambulance.  The third day she was feeling some better where she was able to eat and get a sponge bath.  Fourth day she was better so was able to shower.  She states she is better now with just a little soreness and redness around the injection site.   Pt has contacted her PCP and spoke with the nurse about her symptoms.

We left the facility and on the way home, approximately 45 after she received the vaccine, she began slurring her words ands was confused. The slurring lasted for 2-3 minutes The confusion continued. I brought her the ER where she was immediately taken in for  a CT Scan. She later had an MRI, and met with a Cardiologist. She later had an EEG at the request of a Neurologist. She spent three nights in the hospital.  All tests showed no acute signs of stroke, etc.

                                                A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 80-year-old, female patient who suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia).                                                                                                                      The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided/unknown by the reporter.    On 01-FEB-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 007M20A)  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 01-MAR-2021, the patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Batch number: 023M20A) in her left (dominant) arm.   On 02-MAR-2021, she experienced a side effect which was not listed in the sheet she was given. She wanted to call and report the side effect. She said that she was at the stove cooking and suddenly felt very weak and felt that her vision started to flip. She called for her husband to come over who seated her on a chair. After that she says she doesn&#39;t remember what happened, but her husband told her that her whole body was shaking, her head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds. When she came back, she could hear a rushing sound coming out of her left ear. She was also drenched in perspiration. She felt very nauseated and cold the whole afternoon.  On 03-MAR-2021 she felt better. She had a low grade fever of 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events, suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia) was considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.   The out come of the event, head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                My shot was Saturday at 2 PM.    Monday night I developed a VERY tender, sore achilles tendon.  I could barely walk Tuesday.  I kept working it up and down and I do not excercise,   so it&#39;s certainly NOT from overuse.   I have never had this problem before   I can remember at one time taking some meds that the warnings said they could cause problems with tendons. . so , I&#39;m wondering if this could be because of my shot on Monday.   Hence, the report.

                                                I had my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Feb. 10, 2021. I had about three days of chills, aches, headache, very sore arm. etc. On Feb. 22,2021 a red area  about 3 or 4 inches around the site of the injection was noticed. It was itchy and uncomfortable. I spoke to my internist and allergist. There is some disagreement about whether I should take the second dose.  I have taken benadryl and tylenol. Both doctors said it was unusual for such a reaction 2 days after receiving the vaccine. What information do you have about rashes occurring so long after the vaccination? What is the recommendation about the second vaccine? Thank you.

I took a 20mg benedryl and went to bed.  I woke up this morning with severe itching and a red arm at the injection site.   Prior to yesterday and todays reaction, I did not experience anything except a sore arm. It is 9:00am, I  am waiting to see how I feel, if it becomes necessary to contact my Dr. ????time will tell.

                                                Seizure like episode on 1/12/21, one week after vaccine, last 1.5 hours, consisting of both eyes twitching and clenching/spasm of right hand and arm.  EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

                                                Called at 8 am this morning to inform me of a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She received the vaccine on Tuesday, 1/19/21. The next day she noted the back of her tongue on the R side was swollen. On Thurs, 1/21/21, she reports she woke up with the back of her tongue swollen on both sides such that she had some trouble speaking and needed to be very careful with chewing so she would not bite her tongue. She stated she also had drippy sinuses and an earache which then woke her up several times during the night last night. Today she reports the tongue swelling is only to the back R side of her tongue. She continues to have ear pain. She states she had not reported the symptoms to anyone before her call because she had not felt the symptoms were life-threatening. I asked her if she had taken any benedryl, and she stated the only medication she had taken was her analgesic herbal supplement. She states she has never had a vaccination reaction in the past. I advised her to call her PCP and be seen, which she was able to do. After she was seen, she called and stated while the clinician was looking at her tongue, it started to have shooting pains when she moved it to the right. The clinician stated her tongue and throat were not visibly swollen, noted no swollen lymph nodes, and noted no ear abnormalities.

I called  911 and she was taken to The Hospital where she is currently in ICU on a respirator.

                                                I video chatted with her Thursday after receiving the vaccine. My mom was in poor health but she was talking in complete sentences and responded appropriately. She was upright in bed and made eye contact. She smiled and denied pain. By Sunday, she was extremely weak and unable to sip water with a straw. Her health had changed dramatically and rapidly. She moaned in pain and was very fatigued. Her condition continued to deteriorate over the week and she stopped talking and was constantly sleeping. They started antibiotics for the oozing cancer lesion and then morphine for pain and end of life care. She passed away on January 22nd which was 15 days post vaccination.

                                                Patient reported feeling weak, fatigue, fever (102), and loss of appetite. Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

Then she called her brother who is a doctor and he told her to go to Cardiologist and get in. She was talking normal by the time she talked to him.  Adverse reaction was TIA.

I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

Unable to use my hands due to excruciating pain.  The pain began  3-4 days after the 2nd shot, starting in 2 of my fingers and progressively moved to all the joints in all of my fingers, wrists and my shoulders.  In addition there is swelling. I have very little use of my hands, requiring assistance to care for myself.  I have never had joint pain in my hands before.  The pain has continued for 2 weeks non-stop.  At the doctors recommendation I have been taking Tylenol for Arthritis, however this does not alleviate the pain, only reduces some of the discomfort.

                                                She got the vaccine and did not get an immediate reaction, and on Thursday morning she was tired and couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  So her husband kept her in bed all day and by Friday morning things didn&#39;t get any better, and he helped her to get to the end of the bed and went into the kitchen to get breakfast and he heard her fall, and she fell off the bed and was semi-consciousness, and was able to get her back into the bed and called the ambulance.   She was taken to the hospital Friday morning and she&#39;s still in there.  She has been diagnosed with hydronephrosis, and they keep going back and forth on her diagnoses.  At first they said that she had a UTI, and then they said she didn&#39;t, and then said that she did.  The son feels that all three of the doctors feel that it was some sort of reaction to the vaccine.  They did give her steroids at one time, and she developed severe tremors when she moved which have subsided.  She also has had fever, in a weakened state due to this condition.  She is still being treated for this still and said that she will be having to go to rehabilitation before going home.

For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

When asked what her sx were, she stated fatigue.  She was well the night of the shot, Thur. and Fri. but became tired on Sat. and Sun.

Two staff from clinic called her Mon. and Tues, (1/18 and 1/19).  On Tues. she may have had sl slurred speech.  She was found deceased on

Can and does happen from time to time for a couple heart beats.  Has all my life.  This time did not stop for 20 or more minutes.  I took an extra propranolol and it went back to normal in a few minutes.  Not positive it was result of injection but thought I should mention.

She had water and cold compress. I sat with her and her caretaker for another 15 minutes or so.  The caretaker left to bring car around and we used wheelchair to help her to car.  She never did pass out, and was feeling a little better.  The caretaker was going to stay with her to keep a watch over her.  Patient called a couple of hours later to let us know she was doing ok and had been lying down.  She wasn&#39;t having the chest tightness anymore and her head felt better, but she had developed a rash across the chest.

                                                On January 1, 2021,  patient was admitted to Medical Center with COVID. Tested positive on January 2, 2021. Spent 10 days in hospital. Once recovered from pneumonia and fever gone, on January 10, 2021,  she was transferred to Rehabilitation Center for continued treatment.  She spent 16 days there.  She developed UTI and CDIF infections and was on/off oxygen.  She started physical therapy.  She was scheduled to  be released to go home on January 27, 2021.  On January 26, 2021, the day before going home, Rehabilitation Center gave her the Moderna vaccine.  On January 27, the day she went home, she started feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t walk. My dad tried lifting her and they both fell to the ground. My dad called 911 and she was taken to Medical Center, with high fever and possible stroke symptoms (which later was negative).  Two days later,  she had difficulty breathing and was put on a ventilator. She was on a ventilator for about three days. They took it off and she slowly started recovering. The doctors did all kinds of tests (blood clot in lung, heart, etc.) and all was negative.  The only thing they could trace it to was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. After spending  11 days at hospital and treating her for various infections, her heart stopped and she passed away suddenly.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   On 14 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 14 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had no pain or soreness, but the area was a little tender if you pushed, and she waited one hour in the hospital afterwards.  As the patient was getting ready to leave, she felt a little lightheaded.  She was driven home, she ate lunch and then worked in the yard for a little bit. As she came inside, her Afib started to act up, she took an extra half of metoprolol, and had supper. She took half an alprazolam before going to bed. That night, as she got up to use the restroom, she had a strange feeling in her head like everything was going away. As she walked into the hallway, she blacked out and hit her forehead on the door jamb. Her forehead was all right but there was some bruising near her eye. She went back to bed and fell asleep.  On 15 Jan 2021, when the patient woke up in the morning, her rate was still acting up. At about 9:30am to 10:00am, everything improved, and her heart felt normal. Everything seemed to resolve in approximately 25 hours. Treatment also included acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (no details when it was taken). She contacted her cardiologist since receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The cardiologist encouraged her to take the second dose of vaccine with diphenhydramine and have someone stay with her that night in case something happened again. Consent given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, Afib started to act up, blacked out and hit forehead on the door jamb, were resolved on 15 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, area was a little tender and had some bruising near eye, were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 84 year old female patient with medical history including atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and three cardioversions in the past 30 years. Concomitant medications reported included metoprolol, alprazolam, apixaban, amlodipine besylate, telmisartan, atorvastatin, ubidecarenone, multivitamin, vitamin B2, fish oil and cranberry extract.   She experienced serious unexpected events of Atrial fibrillation and Loss of consciousness and NS unexpected events of Contusion, Head injery and Vaccination site pain.  The events occurred after first dose of the study medication administration after she went back home.   Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However, her medical history of heart condition and medication she took could remain a confounder.

After getting up from bed and eating her usual breakfast, she was returning to her bedroom when she became dizzy and fainted, falling to the floor, hitting her head and suffering other effects, including rhabdomyolysis from being on the floor for a long time after the fall as she was unable to get up. She was transported to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 3 days. She was treated with IV fluids, Tylenol and a short course of antibiotics. While hospitalized, she had a repeat of a rash/swelling at injection site that began about 48 hours after vaccination.  The hospital treated the rash with some barrier cream and within 48, the redness, rash and swelling abated.

She is never sick, so this is alarming to her and to me.

                                                Within a few days, my mother started reporting profound fatigue and shortness of breath while conducting routine household activities. She no longer had to energy for her daily exercise walks and became increasingly lethargic. She died in her sleep while taking an afternoon nap on Thursday, February 4th. I am highly concerned this could be a vaccine related.

The pt reported 2 episodes of SOB and lightheadedness, with the second one as the more severe. On her second episode, she felt severe shortness of breath, tried to walk quickly to her bed with her walker, and fell into her bed. CT angio demonstrated acute saddle PE, mild right heart strain, RUL pulmonary infarct, and mild multifocal pneumonia with suspicion of COVID; IR was consulted and suggested thrombectomy due to the severity of the embolism. In the ED, she was started on heparin drip and put on low-flow NC oxygen without distress.

It was almost as if she had dementia - she repeatedly called myself and my daughter claiming that her phone didn&#39;t work and she needed help. She was trying to tell me a phone number but kept giving me random words instead.  She doesn&#39;t remember talking to any one of us who spoke to her Saturday and Sunday. She was repeatedly asking what a specific button did on her TV remote, and would then ask again a few minutes later the exact same question. This went on for 2 days.

The whole prior she kept saying I am just not right. On the 2/7/21 she a COVID test done, a nurse came to her house and preformed. On the morning of the 8th patient was on the phone with someone else and patient asked this person to call me and go check on her. Within 5 minutes I was over at her house, and I found her on the floor, she on her belly facedown. It looked like she was on the toilet, and it looked like she fall getting her off, she was still wet, she still felt warm. I called the ambulance and immediately  began CPR. When EMS arrived they took over the CPR and transported her to the Hospital. The EMS was there for about 40 minutes and used an machine to preform the compressions. She was pronounced deceased at the hospital.  No autopsy was done.

                                                Though patient was experiencing pain due to her arthritis, soon after the vaccination (1-2 hours) she experienced increased knee pain in both legs. Since the vaccination, she has also had bad diarrhea. Lastly, the worst symptom she experienced was light headedness and fatigue. At around 8:30pm on the day of the vaccination, she got up from dinner to go to bed a bit early. She was feeling tired and started to fade. She fell backwards against the wall, hit her head and landed on her bottom. Thankfully, I was there to help her up and was able to stay up with her to ensure she didn&#39;t have a concussion. Admittedly, she did not drink much water that day so it&#39;s possible this exacerbated the side effects of the vaccine. Maybe the clinics can offer people water bottles or other hydrating beverages to ensure things like this don&#39;t happen?

Other than a minor soreness in the arm, I had no adverse effects. On Friday, January 22nd, however, the area around the injection site became red and warm. At this time, two days later, the inflammation continues and the reddish &#34;patch&#34; is beginning to itch. Just thought that you would want a report of this delayed reaction.&#34; Per conversation with patient, on this date 1/25/21, pt reports that she is still experiencing small amount of itching as well as redness and slight sensitivity to the injection site.  Pt denies need for further medical care, and that she is fine but thought we should know.

                                                At 9am on 1/14/21, Patient was unable to speak and unable to move her arms. After an undetermined period of time (likely less than 5 minutes), she was able to call me (her daughter).  She could hardly move her mouth but she was able to tell me that she needed help. I arrived about 20 minutes later.  She had full movement at that time and was able to speak.  Her BP was 140/73, HR 60. She was tired but scared to go to sleep around 5pm so we went to the local ER.  Her labs, EKG, and MRI were all normal for her age. Today (1/15/21) at 10:30am, she experience the same thing but only in her face.  She was able to move her arms but not able to talk.  I was with her and could tell that she was fully conscious and aware, just couldn&#39;t move.  It happened again but not as severely after she ate lunch around 12pm.

On Saturday, January 23rd, she was exhausted and unable to get up. We learned this from a friend of hers who had called us back after both my brother and I were unable to reach her by phone.  This was about 3:15 pm and we drove to her apartment and found her semi conscious in her bed. We awoke her but she was unable to talk or get up. We then called 911 and emergency paramedics came and took her to hospital.

The patient&#39;s medical history included Parkinson&#39;s Disease.  On 19-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch:unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  Treatment included antibiotics, remdesivir IV (intravenous) and rehabilitation.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   At the time of this report, the outcome of the events did not open eyes (unresponsive), UTI, positive COVID test, fever, and not speaking was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 89-year-old female who experienced serious unexpected events of COVID-19, pyrexia, urinary tract infection, aphasia, unresponsive to stimuli.  The events occurred 25 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Treated with antibiotics and IV remdesivir. Event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                My mother has experienced a severe reaction to her vaccine. Diagnosed with brain encephalopathy probably caused by molecular mimicry in response to the Covid vaccine, she is now being treated as an inpatient at the Clinic.  She was fully independent- living alone, mobile, with excellent cognitive function.  On January 21, 2021 she received her 1st Moderna vaccine. Subsequently family noticed small balance changes, slight fine motor coordination changes (handwriting, etc) and a little forgetfulness not previously seen. Everything was chalked up to her being 89 years old.  She remained independent and relatively fully functional.  Patient is now unable to stand without assistance, leans backward when trying to stand, has developed a spastic tremor bilaterally in her arms, and her cognition is completely altered.  Hallucinations, memory loss, can follow some directions but not all, speech clear but inappropriate.  This declines DAILY. As of March 7th, she could not identify immediate family members in a photo. These changes have all occurred within the past few weeks and appear to have an acute underlying cause not related to age.    Medical staff are looking at an autoimmune encephalitis picture based on the antibodies developed from the vaccine attacking the tissue in the brain and spinal cord that resembles the small piece of the vaccine.    She is currently at the Clinic affiliated hospital. At this time, family is contacting Clinic main campus to request further investigation.   Photographic evidence of rapid decline available, but not able to attach to this form:   Available are three pictures of a log patient keeps with her vitals that she was doing every day.  1. Personal log of vital signs pre Covid vaccine/dose 1 - you can see the handwriting is concise, clear, and orderly.   2. Personal log of vitals after Covid dose 1 on Jan. 21 - slight changes in the handwriting and orderliness but still ok.  3. Personal log of vitals after Covid vaccine dose 2  Feb. 17 - note the illegible handwriting, missing entries, and no spatial awareness of line alignment.  Available are three photos of crossword puzzles she does every day.    1. Puzzle dated Feb.12. Demonstrates her ability to accurately fill most answers with clear writing.   2. Puzzle dated Feb.19 shows an ability to fill in only a couple answers with obvious handwriting changes.   3. Puzzle dated Feb. 21 shows inability to complete, and a strange discrepancy between ability and inability- note 29 across and 18 down.  Patients outcome is undetermined as diagnosis/treatment and prognosis are ongoing.

                                                History of Present Illness     89-year-old female with past medical history significant for osteoporosis and hypothyroidism, who initially presented to ER on March 2 due to lower extremity weakness and right knee pain after a recent fall.  Patient lost her balance and suffered a mechanical fall on February 22.  Patient developed right lumbar and hip pain radiating down her leg.  She saw Dr from orthopedics on February 26 who recommended offloading knee and wearing a knee immobilizer.  Patient was admitted to hospital on March 2 due to worsening knee pain and was incidentally found to be positive for COVID-19.  Patient had received her second Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on February 26.  Patient was evaluated by neurology during that hospital course, who recommended outpatient EMG, physical therapy, and pain management.  No evidence of Guillain-Barré or viral induced neuropathy.  Patient&#39;s lower extremity weakness did improve, and she was successfully discharged home with family and home health on March 5.   Patient reports doing well at home with family initially, was making improvements with her strength and was able to stand and take a few steps with walker and assistance.  On March 8, patient was in bed and she attempted to turn onto her right side, and as she was turning she felt a pop and a pain in her right hip that radiated down her right leg.  Since that time, patient reports having severe pain with movement, rates pain as 8/10 severity.  Denies falls or new trauma since her previous fall from February 22.  Patient was unable to control pain at home, so she came into the emergency department for evaluation.  Initial hip x-ray series revealed questionable greater trochanteric fracture.  CT of right hip subsequently revealed fracture.  Orthopedics consulted.  No significant laboratory abnormalities.  Foley catheter was placed in ER.  Patient was admitted to hospital service for management.  On my interview, patient reports that right hip pain is under good control as long as she does not move, but has 7/10 pain severity over her right lateral hip with movement.   Patient reports following Covid isolation protocols at home with family.  Reports that her Covid isolation will be completed on March 12.  Denies upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient has oxygen saturations of 100% on room air.

Initial ED workup was unremarkable, including CBC, CMP, Troponin, CK, Magnesium, CXR and EKG. Her vitals were normal and she was subsequently discharged home with family. She then returned several hours later following a witnessed cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated and admitted to the ICU intubated and on multiple vasopressors in critical condition.

                                                This was the 2nd Moderna Shot on 2-18-2021.  She received the first shot on 1-22-2021. Patient verbally reported to me that about 4 hours after the shot, she began experiencing severe shocks all over her face and into her left neck and chest area.  This quickly worsened to include her left arm.  That all resolved after a nap.  But when she woke up, and went to the mirror, she noted that her left face was slow and drooping.  She went to the ER.  It was noted that she was having a severe problem with swallowing.  She also was noting severe pain in left external ear canal.  She had obvious severe breakout in the left ear canal - and the immediate area.  She was sent home - and came to my office the next day.  By that time, the symptoms had become much much worse.  She was unable to swallow.  The outbreak in the left ear was much more pronounced.  And her entire left face and left tongue were paralyzed.  She was diagnosed with the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome - she was unable to talk or swallow.  She was readmitted back into the hospital.
