                                                Developed a severe headache within 2-3 hours of receiving vaccine. Took 2 Tylenol. Headache abated but did not resolve. Within the next 2-3 hours felt tingling in my left upper lip. It grew worse and headache worsened. Lip felt like it was swelling but no change was seen. Then left side of face began to ache. Took 2 more Tylenol. Texted my primary care physician who recommended Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Took Benadryl about 4:30 or 5:00.  Left work and went home. Had severe headache. Took my blood pressure. It was 185/68. Had some old Propanolol 10 mg from 2 years earlier and took one and a Prednisone 10mg. By 9:00 pm still felt bad with facial pain and tingling. BP decreased to 148/89. Took another Benadryl and went to bed. Face ant lip better in the morning. Arm sore for 2 days. Developed body and joint aches for the past 2-3 days. Slowly resolving.

                                                Within about 2 days a round red sore appeared on my left arm just below my elbow.  Each day it became more sore and inflamed.  Within one week it became filled with puss, erupted, bled and now seems to be filling with puss again.  Now, within the last 2-3 days the injection site has suddenly developed a large red patch of mildly itchy irritation surrounding the site, with one or two other small patches starting to appear nearby.  During the last few days I have also notice a dull pain coming and going in my left arm.  Using my cell phone, I have taken photos of the sore in 3 stages and of the red injection area.  Those photos could be submitted to my doctor or this office, via text, if helpful.

Then nearing end of 2-mile walk, knees buckled and fell down on sidewalk. (Did not trip).  Hurt arm, scraped face.   Went home, put ice on face, laid down, rested.

Lasted about 4 days.  Two weeks from shot, arm once again was itchy, with red dots near injection shot and down the arm.

Today 1/22/21, 8 days later, I woke up with my left arm sore at the vaccine site and when I looked, I found a bright red circle about 2&#34; in diameter around the site.  It is not hot to touch or sore - just a little itchy.  Since the vaccination I have used no ointments or lotions on my arm, have done the same exercise each day, and have had no bump or accident to my arm.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Ten days after the injection of Covid 19 injection my arm swelled up, and became very red and itchy at the site of the injection.  It just came up out of nowhere it seems as I had no reaction at all to the vaccine during the prior 10 days since the vaccination. This continued for two days.  The first day after it happened I felt tired and weak in the morning.  I got into work here at the house and the weakness went away.  I treated the itchy situation with Clobetasol Propionate Cream which I had here and was prescribed by my dermatologist for poison ivy.  That took away the itchy situation that was very annoying.  Two days into it the swelling began to go down.  Today is the 4th day since the problem occurred and there is no swelling and only a slight redness.  I am assuming that I can take injection #2 on February 9 as scheduled.

                                                When I woke up to use the bathroom I was ataxic and had nystagmus. A while later I became nauseous. I took a baby aspirin because I was afraid I was having a stroke. This lasted about 5 hours. Then I developed a head ache just behind my nose. The headache subsided in the mid afternoon, but I was wiped out and slept most of the day. Today (the next morning) I feel fine, just a little tired.

When I actually looked at it,the area around the site was very, hot, swollen. That evening I took two Advil and used ice. The next day it was still quite uncomfortable and iced the area and had Advil again.  The 30th was still swollen and red.and itchy/stingy. Used ice and Advil. Today it is not as red but still some swelling and a little itchy and minimal discomfort.

                                                My arm wasn&#39;t sore right away but I think I laid on it and the next morning it was sore. It felt like a bee sting I took some medicine and it went away.  On the 27th I had bad gas. I did try a new cereal and thought it was cereal. On the 28th I still gas and upset stomach like flu like symptoms  and felt light headed but not bad. On the 29th still an upset stomach and had diarrhea, I was still light headed and really shaky. I was really weak. I was shaking a lot at arms (hands) and legs were both shaking  and made it hard to walk. On the 30th I still really light headed and my legs and hands were still shaky, still having difficulty walking, still had an upset stomach and still felt weak. On the 31st my stomach was a lot better, I was still shaky and light headed, and I had a weak feeling. My head felt like when you feel like you have a head cold (pressure in my head). Today my stomach is better, I am still lightheaded and still shaky but not as bad. I still feel pressure in my head, but no runny nose or any other cold symptoms.   These were symptoms I had in March when I was sick for 3 weeks. I was negative for COVID but didn&#39;t get back to my normal self until the June.   Doctor was a private practice and recently closed so I do not see my new doctor till the 24th.

                                                About 10-11 days after vaccine, my arm was sore again and I broke out with a red, angry, splotchy, patch.  A little itchy, a little sore, about 3&#34; in diameter.  Did some internet searching and saw it might be &#34;Covid Arm&#34;, no reason to worry, and no reason not to get second shot which I&#39;m scheduled for on the 18th.  Might use the right arm though since it&#39;s still a little warm and sore.

                                                When I woke up the next morning my arm was super red and itchy, throughout the day it got swoller, redder and developed a fever.  About 12n my daughter took the temp of my arm and it was 102 so we made ice packs to help with the pain and swelling.  Later she went an bought Cortisone and used the ice packs and Cortisone for about 3 or 4 days when the arm finally begin to get better.  My arm was so painful it was almost unbareable to touch.

                                                7 days out  from first vaccine I had extreme pain in my neck, shoulders and upper back. Could not turn my head left or right because the 6 Scalene Muscles in the neck were so tight. The pain also went up the right side of my face &amp; skull affecting my TMJ and eating. The Scalene Muscles are on the side and front of a person&#39;s neck so I looked on the web as to how to release them. I gently used my knuckles, fingers and a tennis ball for 4 days on these 6 muscles while someone used a large 2 ball massager on my spine from my bra line and up my neck, and I laid on a heating pad but the stiffness and pain remained.  Pain last 2 weeks, first week the worst. Extreme fatigue for a week . I believe I might have some arthritis in my neck and I frequently have minor aches and pain in my upper back, shoulders, &amp; neck. So this area is venerable so maybe that&#39;s why it happened.  I hope my 2nd shot won&#39;t be worse.

                                                I woke up with severe Number 10 pain in my right knee, front , back and side. It was red, tender and swollen. The pain moved down to my right ankle and foot with severe muscle spasms pulling my right foot inwards toward my left foot. I could not walk to bathroom without screeming. Then it moved to my right hip area with muscle spasms across my lower back.  I am still experiencing pain and muscle spasms (not as severe) today at this writing. It seems to be attacking my body where I have old injuries.

Right arm got very sore, to the point of not being able to move it for a day; fever of 101.2, chills, sweats, stayed in bed most of Tuesday (the day after the shot was given), and then symptoms subsided Wednesday, but was weak and fatigued enough to stay in bed all day. Thursday, tried a little physical activity, and after 30 minutes playing croquet, had to stop and sit down. Went hon=me and napped again. Friday, napped most of day, as on Saturday, and yesterday, Sunday. Today is one week after the shot and I&#39;m still feeling weak - not my normal self.

                                                2 weeks and 2 days after injection of first dose of covid vaccine I noticed a rash and itching on left side of torso.  Included achy pain and sharp, stabbing pin-prick pain. It spread to my back. Went to Urgent Care 4 days later and it was diagnosed as shingles by Dr.  He prescribed 7 days of valacyclovir and Advil and Tylenol for pain. Was told it will take weeks to clear up. I had the Shingrex vaccine (both doses) 18 months ago and am not supposed to be able to get shingles. I had chemotherapy for lymphoma 6 years ago and I believe it adversely affected my immune system. I&#39;m reporting this in hopes you could ask people if they&#39;ve had chemotherapy in the past, which may lead to adverse side effects such as shingles. I also had severe nausea 36 hours after the covid first dose, which I have previously reported. The sore arm was to be expected and I ignored it.

I arose to use the bathroom and when standing at the sink experienced the room beginning to spin and darken.  I steadied myself at the sink; the dizziness passed; I returned to bed after taking two Tylenol tablets to relieve the pain.  My husband, who also received the Covid Moderna vaccine yesterday 2/17/2021 at 10:55 a.m. , was also awakened at 2:00 a.m. 2/18/20121 with the same muscle pains.   6:30 a.m. 2/18/2021 we were both feeling much better and able to carry on usual life activities (such as they are...)  [note 1: I walked 3 miles yesterday afternoon after receiving the vaccine and feeling perfectly fine.] [note 2: we both are enormously grateful for the vaccine!]

She and her son waited in the observation area for 15 minutes and when they getting ready to leave, Patient  stood up and felt weak and dizzy.  Son sat her back down in the chair and the nursing student called out for my attention.  I went over and assessed the patient. MA went and got a manual BP cuff.  Patient reported weakness and dizziness.  I asked a team member to get Dr. and he quickly came over and assessed the patient.  He advised that the patient stay in observation another 20-30 minutes and report any changes.  I offered water and a snack, but patient refused.  We had the patient and son stay as instructed.  About 25 minutes later, the patient was more alert and reported feeling better. I offered to wheel her out in a wheelchair and she refused.  Son also stated that she is doing better. Patient and son, were escorted out the vaccine clinic. No other issues reported.

                                                Arm was sore day after shot and remained so....then last night it started itching and there was a slight rash above.  It is now aching enough that I have tried putting ice on it and taking Tylenol and Advil.  It is somewhat swollen and red with slight rash.  Red at the spot of injection.  It did bleed when shot was given.  I would have thought by now it should be clear.

I woke up about 3:30 AM Saturday and my back, arms and my head were all hurting and I took some Tylenol and went back to bed. I woke up about 6AM and was covered in sweat.  I didn&#39;t want to do anything Saturday, I rested most of Saturday and Sunday. Today the 22nd I am back to my normal self.

I was awake and knew what was happening.  I don?t know how long it lasted. When the episode was over, I went to sleep.  I awakened in about 3 hours, went to the rest room, and returned to bed.  I was uneasy  and thought I might fall.  I slept another three hours and went to the bathroom again. I felt a little better. I got up in about two more hours and felt a little better. Didn?t feel good all day and my arm was really sore.

I went to Clinic Saturday 2/13, for being unbalanced and weak, but not so dizzy. Sunday 2/14 I was extremely weak with low blood pressure and fast heart rate.  Monday  2/15, in the morning,  my left arm started hurting, swelling, was feverish, red, itchy and I had a rash at the injection site. I went to my doctor on 2/19 and he stated that maybe I should not get the 2nd vaccine shot. He stated that he was not certain that everything that happened was a result of the vaccine, but that he couldn&#39;t say that it wasn&#39;t.

The next morning she experienced a kind of paralysis, could not sit up or stand up, was falling out of bed and out of her chair, had to be carried to the bathroom, although she usually can walk by herself. This lasted about a day. I took her to the ER where they excluded other possible causes of her condition and simiply attributed it to the vaccine. No treatment was prescribed.

No fever.  Pain remained for approximately 3 hours.  Took 1 Advil which relieved pain.

The pain was less severe and felt in upper arms only.  Duration approximately 1 hour.  Took 1 Advil which relieved pain.  Two days later (February 25, 2021) at 6:30 A.M., slight upper arm pain returned and remained 30-60 minutes.  Took one Tylenol which relieved pain.

Stayed in bed with head flat for 2 days. Had to be helped to the bathroom. No walking capabilities. Gradually started coming out of it on the third day, still not able to have head up while trying to eat and drink. 4th day better in the morning with head up and walking. Seemingly gone by evening. Horrible episode.

                                                Almost exactly 24 hours after 2nd shot, my mom was getting her hair done and she started breathing hard.  Hairstylist removed her mask and she then passed out.  Called 911.  They observed my mom sweating, her lips and hands were swollen, she was slack jawed, pale and clammy.   After several minutes she came out of it.  Was given a piece of candy thinking it was a sugar low, but her sugar was high 285 @9:00am.  Her color was still pale and she was still incoherent.  While still on with 911, she became more lucid and said she was feeling better, so ambulance was canceled.   I drove her home and checked her sugar @11:00 - 295 and BP 125/55 pulse 75.  She stayed with me for the rest of Saturday.  Her sugar was still high Saturday evening and Sunday morning.  Upon checking her blood sugar log, her sugar had gone up for a week following the first shot.

Vitals, EKG, CT scan, and MRI conducted. MRI showed an acute mild stroke on R side of brain.  Over-night stay was recommended. Echocardiogram was performed the following day and nothing was abnormal. I am now on a heart monitor for 30 days. Upon departure of hospital the symptoms in L leg and arm have nearly resolved but face is still numb/decreased sensation. Plan to contact PCP tomorrow.

It persists without improvement today. I also had pain in the joints in my feet and ankles, hands. Some fatigue. No fever, no chills. I had NO reaction after 1st vaccination, although injection site was hot and very tender for days. Used left arm both times. I saw an online photo of &#34;COVID arm&#34; hypersensitivity reaction and looks exactly like mine. Really quite uncomfortable.

Patient was taking Ondasentron and that was only reliving nausea for 2 to 3 hours. She was taking Tylenol to bring her fever down. 650 mg Tylenol was only lowering temp to about 37.8.  For about 72 hours she was complaining of extreme generalized pain and weakness and had very hard time getting up to go the bathroom.  She started to fill a little better on March 27, 2021.

                                                Tiredness  that night and the next morning i felt like i had not slept and continued over 5 days. i was so sleepy. legs were very shaky and i was very nervous inside. I had shortness of breath and i still have it. I road a bike 4 to 6 miles every day and now i cant.  i had chills and body pain, i feel like i had the flu. dizziness, just just random spouts of sleepiness and it would last for about an 1 hr and half.  My muscle in my chest just tightens and is hard as a rock. and then it goes away.

                                                In the evening lots of pain in left arm. during night chills including teeth chattering, pain all over, no sleep but slept through most of the next day, ate nothing.  Was quite concerning but did not call doctor although I sure thought about it. I was wondering if I was actually infected with Covid- 19. Shot was Tuesday 2: 30 PM, felt a bit better by Thursday but arm still hurt even on Friday arm was red and swollen down to my elbow. Saturday fine. I thought someone should know about this as lost of my friends also had difficult reactions. But this was the first time I saw an opportunity to respond.

These occurred in late afternoon on 3/5/2021 - a day after 2nd Moderna vaccine injection.  I also developed a low fever for part of the same afternoon (3/5) into early eve. I also had some ache in center chest (gone now) which I never had before (angina?).   It is now 3/6/2021 and I still have swollen underarm glands (right arm), right arm soreness at injection site, and some itching there as well. But no fever just now.  I&#39;m VERY CONCERNED the swollen glands will not go away in time for my aortic valve replacement surgery on 3/15/2021.

                                                Sunday, Feb 21, 2021. Patient told her husband she didn?t feel well and she lay down next to him. She was tossing and looked like she was trying to get up. He was talking to her and she wasn?t answering him. She was having trouble breathing. Took her to the hospital right away at 7:30 pm. They put her into a comma with a respirator. Finally went from emergency room to ICU on Monday. Then on Wednesday they took the respirator out and I spoke to her ? told her we all love her and she could only say hoarsely ?terrible, terrible.? They said she might get moved to regular floor. But then Wednesday night couldn?t breathe again and put the respirator back in. Thursday morning husband had it removed and she died that evening at 10:51 on February 25.

                                                Fatigue, headache, joint pain, chills, fever, slight nausea. Started Saturday day after vaccination with fatigue to the point couldn&#39;t stay awake and weak. Sunday woke with bad ache all over and harder to move along with fatigue. Small headache along with slight nausea in afternoon. Woke about 5 am Monday with total sweat, then chills and couldn&#39;t warm up. still had fatigue but not as much pain. Called Hospital Covid Hotline as directed by my Dr.s office (never talked to my Dr.) Nurse with Hotline discussed it with me and we determined it was probably side effects. Since I am aware of allergic reactions, I didn&#39;t feel threatened, only messed up. The fatigue and some aches lasted throughout the weak, and I am still fatigued and weak compared to normal.Aches seem better.

Thereafter, through the night,  a  feeling of fever, back &amp; forth: skin hot, then normal feeling.  Some chills.  Took my temperature several times and would only get a normal reading.  Puzzled, because  I thought I must have a fever.....the STRANGENESS  of this  was that my skin felt like it was BURNING UNDERNEATH my skin....not like any fever I might have ever had. Still normal temp readings.   The next day...mostly in bed, tired, no appetite, continued fever feeling, but no fever temp reading.  The second day, up and around, eating.

I had brain fog for the next 2 weeks.  Tylenol and Advil mostly relieved physical discomfort.    I had the second shot March 16.  The next day I had a severe headache, no energy, achy body,  chills and fever and on the second day after the shot my temperature was 101.4 - 101.8.  Tylenol and Advil relieved the symptoms.  Today, one week after the second shot I developed a pungent chemical taste in my mouth and a similar sense of smell.  The tip of my tongue is tingling, and while I can breathe in deeply,  my chest feels heavy, like I&#39;m not getting enough oxygen.

                                                I had a severe migraine - and I don&#39;t have headaches. My whole face hurt.  (I have two optic aneurisms and I was afraid they were starting to bleed out.) My eye was running water even more at that point and I also had some mucus in my eye. I went to ER.  January 8 and they did a CT scan - and they gave me something IV for pain. They told me to take extra strength Tylenol every four hours and that didn&#39;t help. After one hour, I was in severe pain again. At that point, both eyes were tearing. I went to the dentist (Monday)  -and they did x-rays - (  to see if I had a tooth issue and I went to my ENT doctor  (Tuesday)- and he said it didn&#39;t appear that I had a major infection.  still in severe pain - she gave me a prescription to get rid of infection in my eyes. She gave me a steroid shot - which stopped the pain. The following week, I had an appt with an ophthalmologist- I was not in pain any more and my eyes had pretty much cleared up. He said I probably had a viral or bacterial infection prior and when I got the vaccine then that was why I got a migraine.  2nd vaccine - 30th of January (8:30) - I slept all that day - I was sleepy the whole day and the Sunday, I had flu like symptoms and after that I was fine. This week, I have the infection in my eyes again. I went back to the Dr yesterday to get an antibiotic because I was having the same kind of infections. This time - infection in my left eye, with tearing and mucus. They had me do the eye drops again and nasal spray I&#39;ve been using.

The patient&#39;s medical history included breast cancer in the right breast. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included cholesterol medication and once weekly Fosamax with calcium and vitamin D.   On 10-MAR-2021, the patient received a dose of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 026A21A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Mar 2021, immediately following the vaccination, the patient reported she experienced overheating, became beet red and her blood pressure was over 300. An ambulance took her to the emergency room. She had her troponin levels checked which were over 4000 that lead to a hospital admission and required a unspecified catherization. The patient was discharged home on unspecified date. She reported still feeling groggy and having difficulty with her cognition but it was improving throughout the day. The patient also reported her arm was still swollen, but improving.   Treatment for the event included diphenhydramine and other unspecified medications and treatments.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The events, blood pressure over 300 and troponin over 4,000, were considered recovering.   The events, flushing beet red, overheating, and grogginess were considered not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I went to urgent care and they performed a CT scan of my brain to see if I had a stroke. The results were negative.

The next day I had a  measles-like rash which went away in a few hours. Pain in my arm went away in 2 days.  With the second dose on the third day after the injection I developed severe itching and noticed a red spreading rash in the area of the injection, just a little below the injection site.  This is very red, sore and feels somewhat warm to the touch.  The area is about 5 inches in size and is still painful.  I have also noticed some shortness of breath but minor.   Some numbness and itching around my face.

She was waiting the 15 minutes after the vaccine, at about 8 minutes I checked up on her again and asked if she was doing okay. her eyes were open but she was not responding. I ran over there and tried to get her to respond to my touch and voice. She was breathing but was non responsive. She also had incontinence and when she came to she stated that she was asleep. We called 911 at this time and the paramedics came and took all her vitals, all of which were within range. The paramedics came within 10 minutes and at this time she was already responsive. She kept stating she was just asleep and told us she does sometimes have incontinence and has to wear pads. She refused further medical care and I contacted her when she was at home, where she stated that she would rest up but overall feels fine.

Usually I have a path of Z&#39;s going left to right and then at my age I had  a very slight headache. These looked different with broken up lights. and I woke up with them.Then on Feb 24  :1t 1:15 I had my second. The next morning I woke up with a hazy eyesight but I thought it might be a migraine. I somehow knew it wasn&#39;t but didn&#39;t go to a doctor. The next morning definitely knew.  Saw 2 doctors one in emergency situation he placed me on steroids but I had lost part of my eye sight.

Saw 2 doctors, neither of which could identify the source of the pain.  Inability to rise from bed or couch without assistance.  Both doctors recommended physical therapy.    I waited to visit a doctor for a week, then another week to see a specialist.  I started physical about 3 weeks after the vaccine was admiistered.

Temperature...back to normal 3. Aching...subsided, but not totally gone 4. Nausea...gone 5. Dizziness...subsided but not totally gone 6. Lethargy...hung in there, but not nearly as profound Made myself get up, eat and do minor household chores to gain better equilibrium and feel more productive plus work out the muscle tightness from being inactive

Extra strength Tylenol, 2 every 8 hours helped.  Then the symptoms would return.  This lasted off and on for weeks.  Gradually feeling better but still taking some Tylenol now and then.  Had blood work and my sed rate which is usually 5 was 67 and showed positive antibodies for Covid.  I have not had Covid 19.

                                                Awoke the next morning with upper arm muscle pain bilaterally. The left arm was NOT worse than the right. Pain spread across the neck and shoulders over the following two weeks, with increase in intensity. No treatment given, physical therapy referral made. As of today pain persists in arms and hands, worse in the morning.

She gets weak and would have to lay down a walk and when she goes up and down the steps had to huff and puff, which she had not have this type of trouble in the past.  She went to her cardiologist who took blood work, and he also did a chest x-ray.  She then went to her PCP last week, who said he would check with her cardiologist and see the results of his tests.  She is also a little light headed, but the breathing and wheezing is what is most bothersome.

                                                Experienced intense pain in joints and muscles on 1/27. During the next 2-3 weeks, pain moved to other joints and muscles. Intensity varied. Applied ice to back of knees and legs when movement was affected. As the weeks progressed, fatigue, weakness and pain became more intense. It became difficult to stand from a sit position, walk, turnover in a lying position, bend-over and sit-down. PCP ordered labs on 3/08, which resulted in ESR and CRP showing elevated, inflamed condition. Referred to rheumatology. Diagnosed on 4/21 with polymyalgia rheumatica. Prescribed prednisone 15mg/day. Symptoms relieved and strength returned. Gradual tapering off of prednisone is planned.

                                                To begin, I cannot sit or rise easily because I do not seem to have the use of my legs. I have to push myself up with my arm when I am trying to stand. When I am standing and walking, I cannot straighten up completely and I seem to loose my balance. This problem seems to only be below the waist. The tops of my legs attaching to my buttocks are a constant soreness. Below my knee on the left side of my left leg, there is constant soreness. My legs are continually throbbing down to the ankles. Just now as I writing this sitting at the computer, my legs are throbbing. When I am lying in bed, there is constant throbbing and soreness. This morning when I awoke, it seemed as if there were needles pushing into my left heel while lying in bed. I have been taking a 500mg Tylenol in the a.m. and before going to bed but it doesn&#39;t give relief. This doesn&#39;t appear to be a problem with my joints but rather a stinging sensation in both legs. When I am driving, my right leg will begin to have a severe cramp which is very painful until I can stretch. I can bend over but with great difficulty. I cannot step up on a curb without great difficulty. I have a general overall feeling of weakness and instability. I did cease using pravastatin. I have been feeling these issues for about 1 month and they seem to worsen. My first Covid vaccine was January 25th. My second Covid vaccine was last Thursday, February 18th.  Thank you for brainstorming this for me. I am a very active person so this is a puzzle for me.

I have no more memory of that day. Except for meals and bathroom use I remained lying down all day. I was very nauseous and severely weak, light-headed, and had brain fog, Except for the nausea I felt that way for 10 days. On the 10th day I felt able to stand long enough to take a shower.

                                                On April 18 I developed a headache and fever (101), fatigue, tightness/pressure in my throat/esophagus.  Continued through April 20, when I called my GI physician to describe symptoms.  Doctor recommended going to Urgent Care to be tested for COVID 19.   Within an hour or two I went for the test, which was negative.  The attending doctor then ordered EKG, blood tests, and CT scan to see what was going on.  Found high white blood cell count and Pericardial Effusion.  Sent me to hospital, where I was admitted and spent 6 days.  The diagnosis was that the Pericardial Effusion was caused by inflammation, not infection, and I was started on a combination of drugs to eliminate the fluid.  I was released on April 26 with only trace fluid around my heart.

                                                The patient presented to our pharmacy on 6/12/21 to pick up a prescription for Ketoconazole 2% topical cream.  At the consultation window the patient mentioned that this was to treat a rash on her neck that she believes was caused by the Moderna vaccine.  She received her first dose on 1/29/21 and reported that two days later she had a rash on her neck. She stated that the rash burned and was itchy, and that it gradually spread to her inner left forearm and face.  At the pharmacy on 6/12/21, her neck was visibly red, along with her face and left forearm.  The patient saw her primary care doctor in Februrary, but she states that she was not given any thing for the rash and was told by her doctor to monitor the rash.  The patient saw Doctor again in May and was prescribed a cream for the rash, but the patient does not recall the name of the cream and there is no history of that prescription at our pharmacy. The patient reports that the cream did not help, so she saw her allergist in June.   She saw Provider and was prescribed ketoconazole 2%.

                                                Patient received the second moderna covid-19 vaccine on 4/1/21.  2 days later she developed a painful itchy rash at injection site that traveled down her whole arm to her hand.  Over the next few days she began to feel dizzy and weak.  She had an episode where she was parked in her driveway and felt she could not get out of the car due to feeling dizzy, weak, and faint.  She was able to get out of her car and to her bed were she remained for the next 8 hours.  She felt she could not get our of bed due to feeling so weak and faint and she feared she would fall.  She woke up the next morning able to get out of bed.  She then began to develop pain and weakness in both shoulders, both arms, both hands, both knees, and both ankles.  We ordered blood test on 5/11/21 including a CBC, CMP, CRP, urinalysis, ESR Wes&#43;Fer, Rheumatoid arthritis factor, and ANA all blood test came back within normal limits.  Patient was seen in the office on 5/24/21 for a physical exam and was found to have loss of range on motion in both shoulders and arms, pain and swelling at both elbows, both hands, and both knees.  Patient also complained of general weakness, fatigue and a fullness or swelling in both ankles.  She has been doing physical therapy, is taking tylenol for the pain, and has been on 2 rounds of steroid medrol dose packs.  Patients continues to suffer with weakness, fatigue, muscle, joint pain in whole body. We have also contacted the moderna company and was told they could not help us and hand no treatment or other advise for us.  We have referred our patient to a Rheumatologist.

By May 1st could not climb steps. Had to use hiking poles for walking.) in a 76-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 001B21A and 006M20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 on 04-Nov-2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension since 2014 and Walker user. Concomitant products included LISINOPRIL for an unknown indication.   On 12-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021 at 1:45 PM, the patient experienced GAIT DISTURBANCE (Difficulty walking. By May 1st could not climb steps. Had to use hiking poles for walking.) (seriousness criterion medically significant), ASTHENIA (Weakness), SCIATICA (bilateral hip pain began, unrelated to any injury, gradual onset. sciatic distribution/sciatic pain), INSOMNIA (Difficulty sleeping turning in bed), DECREASED APPETITE (Lack of appetite), ARTHRALGIA (Bilateral hip pain/severe hip pain/hip pain was worse after inactivity), PYREXIA (Fever 103) and MYALGIA (Myalgias). On 20-May-2021, the patient experienced POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Diagnosed Polymyalgia Rheumatica) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was treated with NAPROXEN SODIUM (ALEVE) ongoing since an unknown date at a dose of 220 mg twice a day; PREDNISONE ongoing since an unknown date at a dose of 15 mg once a day; PREDNISONE at a dose of 12 mg once a day; PREDNISONE at a dose of 10 mg once a day; MELOXICAM ongoing since an unknown date at a dose of 15 mg once a day and IBUPROFEN at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Diagnosed Polymyalgia Rheumatica), GAIT DISTURBANCE (Difficulty walking. By May 1st could not climb steps.

                                                Within 15 mins after the vaccine, I felt weakness and weak in the knees and chills;  it didn&#39;t feel flu-like though. and within the first few hours I had &#34;Moderna arm&#34; - right near the injection site - big red splotch and the arm was sore. The redness in the arm lasted a good week. It was a red blotch but not itchy or swollen. I didn&#39;t feel well for a few days after the vaccine.  The symptoms came and went as far as how I felt - chills, weak, not feeling terrific for those first few days or so. A month after the second shot, I had a rash on my neck. It came and went - a little itchy and then not itchy. (This happened for a month.) And then at the same time, I felt the same original symptoms - chills and not feeling good. It lasted about three days - the chills and weakness. And then it went away. Even since, April, I get this periodically - I feel weak in the knees, I get the chills and I have to take a Tylenol or something. The middle of May, I was taking off my makeup and I felt a burning on my face (same stuff I&#39;ve been using for 20 years on my face) red splotch from  top of nose and all around and on cheekbones and down the face - it was puffy, swollen, red and caused bags under my eyes and redness under my eyes- and it still is. He gave me a cortisone lotion (my dermatologist) - It&#39;s not as red as it was but if I press on it the redness comes back. I have not changed anything with make-up; lotion or food. I have photos of it that I can send of my face. It&#39;s still here  - maybe not as bright - and I&#39;m not sure that I notice difference using the cortisone cream. It&#39;s been a good six weeks since it started on the face.

                                                Hospital Course: In summary this is a 76-year-old female with past medical history significant for hypertension, CKD stage III, chronic dizziness, and glaucoma, who presented to the emergency department on 3/11/2021 due to generalized weakness, slurred speech, and confusion.  Patient lives alone and there is no last known well time.  Of note patient had reportedly received the Madera COVID-19 vaccine in the days leading up to her presentation. History was limited due to the patient&#39;s altered mental status.  I was later informed by the patient&#39;s son via phone that she just recently received her first Covid vaccination here at Hospital earlier this week. Additional information for Item 18:    Due to concern for stroke stroke alert was activated and CT imaging of the head was ordered.  However due to patient&#39;s agitation this is not able to be performed despite giving a total of 4 mg of IV Ativan.  As of this point the decision was made to intubate the patient in the emergency department for imaging and further work-up of her encephalopathy could be performed.  Patient was subsequently extubated on 3/12/2021 at which point she was able to report her symptoms started as numbness in her feet and the inability to walk followed by no further recollection until being in the ICU.  She reports similar episode on a trip for which no cause was identified.  The results of her testing remain inconclusive and did not identify any acute cause for her presentation and therefore working diagnosis was possible TIA versus conversion disorder.  Patient was subsequently transferred to the general medical floor on 3/13/2021.  Patient seen by me on:  3/11/2021   Assessment:  76-year-old female with a history of hypertension and CKD 3 presents to the ED with altered mental status, apparent time of onset approximately 7:15 PM, unable to answer questions or follow commands   Differential diagnosis:  CVA, TIA, ACS, electrolyte abnormality, occult infection, metabolic encephalopathy Encephalopaty requiring intubation and intensive care.

Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, numbness, tingling, falls, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, changes in diet, recent travel. No dysuria, hematuria, rashes, bruising or bleeding. She states she has had at least 6 or 7 episodes of emesis and is on her fourth emesis bag in the ER. She states she feels very dehydrated and week.  I was informed that the patient was admitted and was under the care of a hospitalist who I could not reach.

Pain bad enough Wednesday night/Thursday early morning to contact Dr. Thursday. He determined my pain was muscle pain. Suggested Aleve (as Tylenol and Advil weren&#39;t working) and heating pad (which I had used on Wednesday during day). Aleve helped a lot. Pain by today (Sunday) is minimal but still some minimal discomfort.

About 7 hours later i got up from chair and i was dizzy and my balance was off and i almost fell into table. I didn&#39;t feel right. I went and sat back down and i was very tired and i started getting headache. I called my daughter and a nurse she knows told me to take extra strength Tylenol 500 mg take 2 every 6 hours. I started at 730 and went until 130. I slept on and off and got up Tuesday and my arm was still hurting. I was very tired and had no energy. When i got up later in the afternoon i had extreme chills. It was 83 degrees in Florida nd i turned heat up to 84 and i was still shaking. I got under covers and had a fever it was 100.8. Went to sleep that night and fever broke. Got up Wednesday and felt a little better, still had headache and tired. Decided to take a shower. I noticed my left arm where the injection was was all red. 6-7 inches long and about 5 inches wide which i never saw before. after shower I called my PCP I contacted the nurse said she thought it was normal and if there was no  change to call her back on Friday. my arm is still red and warm i went to sleep but couldn&#39;t sleep. I saw an article about COVID arm rash seen after Modern vaccine and now i know that&#39;s what I had. I feel better after I read it in the magazine today and it said it will only last a week. This should be listed as a side effect so nobody else wonders what it is. I drank so much water because it said to drink plenty of water and i tried to use arm as much as possible.

                                                After i had my injection about 7 hours later about 4-5 o&#39;clock I was sitting in a chair and I got up and my balance was completely off and I almost fell into glass table. I felt very foggy and my head wasn&#39;t right. I had to hold on to things and I sat down and I kept saying I just didn&#39;t feel right.  I called my daughter and my arm was hurting and I figure that&#39;s what happens, I was getting so tired and really bad headaches. My daughter asked somebody and they told me to take extra strength Tylenol (500 mg ) 2 at a time 6 hour intervals. Which i did i got up the next morning and i had to go back to bed i had no energy. I felt horrible. When i did get up in the afternoon all of a sudden i had horrible chills and that day in Florida it was 82 degrees and i put the heat on 84 and i was extremely shaky and cold. I went back to bed and later i did have a fever, not highs, it only went to 100.8 but during the evening it did break because my sheets were almost saturated. Yesterday morning 1/27 Wednesday i felt better, fever had gone down, pain was still there in my arm and swelling. I thought that was natural. In the afternoon i decided to take a shower and i noticed my left arm around the injection site was a red rash about 7inches long and 4-5 inches wide which  i had to seen before i called my primary doctor just to make sure this was normal around injection site and talked to the nurse and she thought it was normal. But if there was no changes to call her back on Friday. Last night not able to sleep i saw an article that said COVID arm rash seen after Moderna vaccine, annoying but harmless it was a large article and it made me feel better but there were only 14 examples but they believe there were more because they were younger people with the health dept. that received this vaccine. It said in 1week it should go away.  I still have it, its still red and sometimes itchy and i am happy to say now that i know it will be a week i feel better. it should be on the list of side effects for all.

It is now Jan 30, 2021 and the area is still itching, tho less, and is still hot.  There is a 1/4&#34; wide reddish ring in a circle of about a 3&#34; diameter around the shot site.  Today I put a cold compress on it and was surprised that as soon as I took it off after about 10 minutes it was still hot.  I am worried about having the 2nd shot in the same place.

The next couple of days it remained very itchy, started light pink and got pinker never got really red color. On Sunday 31st in the morning it looked normal but later in the day it got pink again. Yesterday and today it is fine besides it is itchy. I have not been scratching it.  One day I put some Benadryl cream on it one time.

Temperature 100.1 which is about three degrees above my normal temp.  Night sweats.  Following day, malaise, headache, and discomfort when inhaling a full breath.  Night sweats again.

                                                No problem with discomfort after shot, just a little sore arm for a day.  No flu symptoms.  Eight days after the shot, however,  my right arm started to itch  in the morning, and by nighttime, the shot site was no longer itchy but swollen, red, and hot.  I applied ice treatment which helped relieve the heat and swelling.  Today, my arm is much better.  I still have a slight swelling with a  light redness around the shot site, but no discomfort, no heat.  I reported this delayed reaction to the shot to my doctor?s office, and they referred me to you to report my experience since they thought it was an unusual reaction.

Then about 8 days later, just over a week she woke up and her arm was red again and more swollen and looked like a black and blue area where the needle went in.  There was a red rash around that point.  The rash was larger than the palm of her hand.  She was tired that day and it did go away after 2-3 days.  She took Tylenol one night due to the pain to help sleep.  She did not call her doctor.  It has now totally resolved as of today, 2/10/21.

As far as I can tell, no swelling involved.   Also still experiencing tiredness.

                                                This event , because so many elderly people have the fillers in their knees should be widely publicized! We have fillers that help so much to be able to walk without pain, but this vaccine has caused me to have extreme pain and burning and not be able to walk without pain for 4 days now. NO ONE has said anything about how this Moderna vaccine would  affect us because of the Hyaronolic Acid injections to our knees. We should have been allowed to get Pfizer!!!! I am so upset about this and extremely disappointed in our government&#39;s lack of disclosure.

In the early afternoon I began to feel shortness of breath, breathing not normal and it steadily increased towards early evening when I took 2 more Benadryl which then quieted down the breathing reaction. Also that day I experienced a sore arm. The next day, breathing problems were almost all gone but decided to take 1 more Benadryl. During the day I felt flu like symptoms. The third day I feel like myself again.

She had no strength at all in  any of her extremities which lasted all day, from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.  Her daughter called and she informed her that she could not get up, and wiggled herself through the house and pulled herself up by the hand of her granddaughter to help her.   It then resolved and she has not had any other problems.  Her arm did hurt for about a week and sore to the touch, but wanted to report that she had the extreme weakness.  She did not consult her doctor, cannot get through to them, been trying for 3 days.

Upon waking the next day, around 8AM, Friday, I had a bad headache, body aches, weakness, could not get warm.  I laid on the  couch all day and didn&#39;t eat anything until 4 in the afternoon, a little soup.  Later in the day I got a fever and was so weak I could barely walk, I fell when trying to get up, fortunately I fell onto the couch, I made it to the bed and didn&#39;t get up until about 8 the next day.   Saturday.  I felt much better then but am still weak.

                                                On Wednesday afternoon she had a fever of 103, was very fatigued.  Got up in the middle of the night and had dry heaves, went back to bed and was okay.  Her arm got really red, hot and blisters all over it like a sunburn.  It is down to about the size of a half dollar today.  The blisters burst and have made places, is still warm and sore and looks like it is drying up.  Did look like a severe sunburn.  She ran a little fever until Thursday night 2/18/21.  The arm is still sore to touch today, 2/22/21.  She took some Tylenol the night her fever was 103, then it went to 101.   The fatigue is diminishing, she has slept a lot, but wonders if her arm is ever going to be right.

                                                Shortness of breath; Hemoglobin went from 8.8 to 8.2; oxygen level was at 82 whenever she is standing or walking; Sore arm; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 77-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced shortness of breath, sore arm, oxygen level at 82 when walking, and hemoglobin went from 8.8 to 8.2.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 20 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273(Lot number:039K20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20 Jan 2021, the patient experienced soreness in arm immediately after receiving the shot. The soreness resolved few days later.  On 29 Jan 2021, Lab work done due to her being anemic and on perpetual oxygen therapy. Her hemoglobin level went down from 8.8 to 8.2 and her oxygen level was 82 on exertion.   On 31 Jan 2021, the patient started experiencing shortness of breath. Patient stated that her saturation level was at 82 percent whenever she is standing up or walking and she runs out of breath. When she sits down, the level of the oxygen will go up. She said she is not sure if her medical condition is getting worse or if this is vaccine related  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, sore arm, oxygen level at 82 percent when walking, and hemoglobin went from 8.8 to 8.2 were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information from the source document that the patient is an anemic patient on perpetual oxygen, the events of oxygen saturation decreased, hemoglobin decreased and dyspnea on exertion is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. The event of pain in extremity is possibly related. Further information has been requested.

                                                Moderna COVID19 Vaccine EUA I received the first injection on Feb. 13, 11:00. Because I am very thin, I wasn&#39;t too worried when my arm was sore for a couple of days, but on the 6th day, I was awakened at night with an intense itch at the injection site, and in the morning I saw an egg-shaped and egg-sized bright red area and it was swollen. I contacted my doctor on line, and she recommended hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl, which I have been doing for three days. The red patch has calmed down to light pink, but it&#39;s still sore and a bit swollen. It&#39;s been two weeks since the injection and I&#39;m scheduled for the second injection on March 13. I&#39;m concerned that the reaction will be worse next time.

I took two Tylenol and went to bed.  I got up two times during the night to go to bathroom.  I felt more achy all over and unsteady on my feet. Did not want to get out of bed next day, so slept until noon.  At noon my temperature was 100.4. I took 2 Tylenol every 6 hours.  Had a very achy, miserable day and just rested.  Was somewhat better by bedtime and had a better next night of sleep. Next day am still achy but much better.

Painful arm a few hours after injection, which mostly ebbed, with the redness starting about 7-8 days after injection, becoming somewhat tender, with that ebbing by 5 day.  On third day ( 8 days after vaccine) Urgent care diagnosed it as a seondary infection and prescribed doxycycline.   Dr. said had never seen anything like it.  Took the antibiotic for 2 days and stopped.  Med seemed to make no difference.

                                                I felt like I was hit by a ton of bricks. I got feverish, the chills, and muscle aches and pains to the point that all I wanted to do was sleep. So I went to bed, but just as I would be close to falling asleep I&#39;d have to get up to empty my bladder. This was happening almost every 15 minutes for a few hours. I knew I probably should hydrate, but I chose not to because I wanted to get some uninterrupted sleep which I finally did at about 4:00am which only lasted a couple of hours. Then up at about 6:30am when I took some acetaminophin and went back to sleep. I was in bed all day, sleeping most of the time. When I&#39;d wake up I&#39;d take my temperature and most of the time I&#39;d hydrate. I haven&#39;t had anything to eat because I wasn&#39;t feeling  strong enough to even heat water for soup. My normal temperature is about 97.6 give or take. The highest temperature I had was 100 when I took another dose of acetaminophin. But one time it was 94.3!!! I started feeling better at about 8:30pm (3/1/21)  and was able to make myself some chicken noodle soup and had some cereal and cottage cheese with it. I finally felt &#34;normal&#34; on Tuesday morning (3/2/21) after getting a good night&#39;s sleep.

                                                On 3/1/21 at 11:00 AM I received my second dose of the vaccine Moderna. I was fine all throughout the rest of the day. Upon awakening early on the morning of the second, I had moderate aching in all joints, headache, weakness and fatigue. I stayed quiet for day. Upon getting ready to shower on the morning of the 3rd I found I was covered with an angry bright red rash from my neck down to my knees both front and back. Because I did not shower on the 2nd of March I have no idea when it began. On Thursday my head still felt pressure but felt a little stronger and that evening I again showered and the rash looked less angry and bright. Waking this morning on Friday the 5th the rash is gone and I am feeling much better except for soreness in the armpit of the right arm that received the injection.

                                                I am starting this report with the current status of my, nearly, 6-week ordeal of  agonizing pain, doctor appts. debilitation, pain meds, a blood test and the final  MRI  this past Saturday, 3/6.  Finally, an MRI has confirmed physician&#39;s recent suspicion that my  second Moderna vaccination was improperly administered. In fact, it tore a  tendon in my right shoulder. I knew something was wrong when I saw how high  the needle was injected into my arm/shoulder. I just didn&#39;t know what the  ramifications would be.  I have been referred to a surgeon, and my appt. is 3/16).  Summary of Events:  On 2/1/21, I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine and had 2 days  of moderate pain and soreness.  But about 3 days later, 2/4, I awoke to excruciating shoulder/arm pain that had  me sobbing out loud. I took Tylenol and waited. Nothing. I took more Tylenol and  slowly the pain diminished. For an hour or so.  All I could do was lie on the couch, literally, groaning and unable to lift my arm  By evening, the only relief I could get was from an old (hip surgery) Oxycodone pill. I took 1/4 piece and slept the night.  Friday and Saturday I was totally debilitated. I couldn&#39;t lift my arm, care for my  dog or do anything but lie on the couch, still sobbing, until small pieces of the  Oxy set in again.  It was the weekend, and I didn&#39;t want to bother anyone but I never felt such pain  for such an extended time or survived so long on meds.  Monday morning, 2/8/21, I called my Doctor. I was very  concerned and really wanted to make sure this pain was still from the vaccine  and not some &#34;weird&#34; condition that might have hit me. The office told me the  pain was probably from the vaccine and advised me to keep taking Tylenol. So it  continued, on and off, relief and agony. I was sure it would stop. It didn&#39;t.  Thursday, 2/11, I saw the Doctor, in person.  Physician did not have an answer for the pain but gave me a prescription for  Celebrex and did a blood test to see if there was a bacteria infection that might  have invaded the area. We would wait for results. Another weekend of pain but  lessened a bit.  Around 2/13, a neighbor called me with an article he found about the SAME  situation MANY people were suffering (thousands) and LAWSUITS pending!! I  didn&#39;t know what was happening to me but the Gov&#39;t did. The article was found  on internet, 2/12, and printed an article from news paper, 2/12  No  other reports appeared anywhere. The pertinent findings of the article: thousands of vaccinated people (Covid and  flu) have reported similar pain and debilitation. The previous gov&#39;t has  introduced a law prohibiting lawsuits (l think against the pharmas but not the  administering agencies. Not sure.) that was to go into effect, 2/23. Again, not sure  of details.  But no one knows about this - people NEED to know. I immediately notified my  family and close friend about my situation. While the cause is not certain, it is  suspected that improper injection technique/training/experience is to blame.  To get the word out, I posted on social media, wrote representatives, etc.   And now I found you. The information must be made available; not to stop  vaccinations but to alert the public if they occur.

                                                Sudden dizziness with some nausea and cold drenching sweat - no fever - extremely weak and fatigued and could barely stand and then severe headache came on about 10 minutes into episode.  Dizziness lasted approximately 2 hours until I could safely move and then began to subside.  I noticed my eyes did not want to focus well and was seeing spots when I tried writing down what happened.  Chills began and I felt extremely cold, my head felt &#34;foggy&#34; and tight, ringing in ears started and headache moved to migraine level.  Slight fever 99.8. Main dizziness did pass after about 2 hours but other things continue to linger on an off.  I just feel &#34;off&#34;.  I have actually heard other seniors mention some of these very symptoms so am not super alarmed, however, I did not have any of these side effects before the vaccine for Covid-19.  I did experience extreme fatigue and bad headaches since I received the first dose on January 27, 2021.    I have not called my doctor regarding these side effects since I have heard many seniors complain of very similar reactions.  I have rested as much as possible, tried to stay hydrated, and taken Tylenol when needed.  For the dizziness I tried to stay as still as possible and put my head between my knees until it finally passed.

But I have not recovered my previous level of energy, which was already very, very low because of longstanding chronic fatigue syndrome.  My persistent vertigo (since 1989) is also worse than it was, and continues so after 2 weeks from date of first shot.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

I have had Rotator Cuff repair twice on Rt. Shoulder and the pain I feel there is like it is in my rotator cuff. I cannot lift my arm up above my waist without feeling the pain. When I do not use my arm, there is not pain. I do not have a rash any longer but feel there must be swelling in the shoulder. Ocassionally I have some itching in injection area but try not to scratch at all.

She had diarrhea but not too bad, and then started throwing up uncontrollably, violently, projectile.  She goes to where she was disoriented and did not know where she was.  She was reaching to touch things to figure out where she was.  Her husband called the ambulance, and she went to the hospital and got her normalized but does not know how or what they did.  A woman came in to register her and started talking to her and was not making any sense.  They treated her in the ER, took a bunch of tests, and sent her home.  They told her that she had food poisoning and hadn&#39;t had anything but some biscuit and gravy and had some crackers when she got the vaccine as she was weak.  They gave her Ondansetron for her stomach to stop the diarrhea, but she is still having that.  She is still having the weakness, and not back to her normal self.

                                                I have been experiencing symptoms for over a month now.  Extreme fatigue, sometimes nausea and light headedness.  The symptoms are better some days than others but never completely go away.  Most of the shaking and shivering have gone away but still do not feel well.

She sleeps in a fetal position with her legs curled and when she woke up she was not able to get up and was stuck in the fetal position.  She was in excruciating pain, and had a dog to let out as she lives by herself.  This went on for about 3 days.  Then she went back to work and worked 2 days and then she woke up the next morning 3/28/21 and every joint in her body including her toes was throbbing and aching like she had arthritis.  Since then she has continued with these symptoms, and aching all the time in her feet, shoulders and other areas.   She saw her stomach doctor who she told him about her side effects and he advised her not to take the 2nd vaccine.  She took her normal pills and Tylenol arthritis.  She did notify her regular provider of her reaction as well.  She went and got x-rays of her knees and legs at healthcare facility that said that they did not find anything other than some arthritis.  It also affected her arms, legs and feet and had x-rays again and showed nothing but some arthritis in her hips.  She still continues with the same symptoms.  It will ease up, she will go about her business and then will wake up with throbbing pains.

Some swelling  in hand as well numbness - fullness feeling in inside of arm especially at bend and hard lump in muscle of arm. I had this w first shot, filled report, met w 3 doctors, each prescribed  different rememdoes.  First time went to UC - prescription for steroids &amp; ice. Family dr back from seminar visit - said should never have prescribed steroids  -- prescribed heat, topical cream.  2nd shot effects mush later showing - this time dr prescribed xtra strength Tylenol,  ot ibuprofen.  Do not want to talk meds, want to know why this is happening. Since last major surgery, 2019, after 2 others in 6 years, only take low dose aspirin &amp; vitamins pills.

On the 3rd day she started physical therapy.  She started getting worse so she contacted her surgeon that ordered an MRI.  DX is stenosis and bulging disc which she has had for years but has never been laid up because of it.  She went to her PCP. They feel like she developed inflammation of the nerves for the weak parts of her body after taking the vax.   The pain is in the nerve from her waist down to her ankle. She is still doing the physical therapy.  She is scheduled to see an Orthopedic Doctor on 4/23/2021.

It was about 4 x 6 inches in size, extremely itchy and warm to the touch.  She applied ice to it for about 4 days and took Benadryl which seems to help.  She says it is still pink but no longer is itching or hurting.

                                                She got her vaccine, about a day and a half her arm was sore and itchy.  Then later on it was red, splotchy kind of redness, but not at the point of the injection, just a couple of inches below towards the elbow.  This lasted for about a week.  The soreness went away but could see redness in the area, which took about 4 weeks for this to disappear completely.  She had a headache which lasted for a short period of time, and disappeared.  She also had a swollen lymph node along her waste that were sore about 2 days after the vaccine, which also disappeared and had it only for a day or two.   She started noticing a sound, thinking it was in her old house the 2nd week of April, but moved to a quieter neighborhood and still noticed it.  She was reading an article this morning in the paper and realized the sound that she was hearing was tinnitus.  She was only born with one ear and it sounds more like a beeping sound than a ringing, but it continues to bother her.  She does not notice it when she&#39;s out driving around from the other noises in the environment but when it&#39;s quiet due to the one ear she can hear it.  With only one ear she cannot determine the direction of where the sound is coming from, but does notice it during quietness.  She puts her ear up to the wall to determine where the sound is coming from and plugged her ear, and determine it was from the ear itself.     She is worried about it getting worse or not getting any better with only having the one ear.

                                                She received her vaccine. The next few days, she was extremely tired and slept a lot. A couple days after the vaccine, she complained that her stomach hurt slightly. Days went by and the pain slowly got worse. She didn&#39;t feel like eating. Then on 2/8/21 in the middle of the night, she woke up in excruciating pstomach pain and her husband called ambulance. They rushed her to ER. The determined that her colon had ruptured near her stomach and they took her in for emergency colonoscopy. The surgery was a success, but a couple days after, she was weak and said she didn&#39;t want to fight any longer. They put her on hospice measures and she died 2/15/21. We feel that she was doing fine before the vaccine, and then all of a sudden this occurred. Seems to be too much of a coincidence. Finally taking the time to report it, in case there are others having colon and or stomach issues.

                                                Patient started having stroke like symptoms at approximately 1145am on May 30th.   Pt was having difficulty dressing and generalized feeling of being paralyzed for a brief moment or two.   Pt was also having trouble getting out her words/thoughts.  Pt never had loss of function of her limbs, No weakness, No facial droop, No loss of bowel or bladder control.   Once in ER at Hospital,  pt was found to have irregular heart rhythm e on EKG (Sinus Tachycardia with possible AFib with rate in the 100&#39;s up to 130&#39;s) - CT Scan of Head was negative for bleed or acute ischemia.  By 8pm the same day the pt had improvement of speech and getting out words/thoughts better and by the next day at 10am sounded back to normal self and still with no other neurological deficits.   During that next day we learned that the patient had been to her Primary Care Dr on 5/24/2021 for routine visit when they did an EKG in the office and pt was thought to have an &#34;irregular Heart rhythm&#34; and referred to see a cardiologist.  During course of hospital stay the patient was treated with heart rhythm medications and Eliquis for Diagnosis of Afib/TIA.

                                                She got her vaccine, her left arm hurt as it does with her regular flu shot and normally goes away after a week.  The next day she read what to do, but she moved her arm slowly around to exercise it to get rid of the soreness.  On the 2nd day the pain went away.  By the 3rd day it was back with a vengeance, and stayed there and never got better.  Her joint and everything started to hurt.  It felt like she had to have rotator cuff surgery again, and it still feels that way.  She went to her doctor who gave her a steroid shot which helped but then it came back again.  Within a week she could move her arm, but in a certain position it hurts her extremely badly.  If she raises her arm it &#34;bites&#34; her and the pain does not cease.  Her groin area also she is having pain there as well that radiates to her knee.   The front top side is burning and sore all of the time, and does not want to quit.  She takes baby aspirin and was given Norco but she did not like how it made her feel and doesn&#39;t take that.  The 800 of Ibuprofen did not help with the pain, neither does Tylenol or Advil.  She states that the medicines make her muscles sting and burn and feel worse.  She feels that the vaccine got to her vulnerable places of pain from before that have healed and feels that it has reactivated that pain and the pain won&#39;t go away.   Her arm did not hurt her for years, and her leg pain had been gone for a long time, but since the vaccine she has had nothing but pain.  She got her 2nd vaccine on 3/25/21, she did not have any adverse reaction, just the reaction from the 1st one did not go away and it did not go away after the 2nd one and still has the same pain.  It did not bother the bladder where she had surgery, just the joints of her body where she had previous problems.    Her back has been out of place and could not walk for a year and a half, but this has not bothered her back.

I did not have any energy and couldn&#39;t concentrate since the pains were happening all the time. My doctor treated me with Valtrex and a topical pain killer (Lidocaine). I was diagnosed with Shingles but did not break out. It took about a month to recover from the Shingles and then my ear continued to hurt for another two to three weeks. Now, everything seems to be fine.

Few days later happened again but continued to be weaker and Blood pressure increased to 207/140 while I was out shopping. Drove myself to hospital ER and they admitted me. from 04/26 to 04/29. On 04/29 they did MRI brain scan and determined that I had suffered a right quadron brain bleed which left me left side leg weakness and balance issues. Sent me home on 04/29 and told me see primary Dr. right away.. They ordered in home therapy for a few weeks and in 2 weeks I start outpatient therapy . Since this 3 of my Dr&#39;s agreed to have a Heart loop monitor inserted in my chest which I agreed to. Staples come out next week.

                                                fever (103.9) one day after last vaccination.    10 days after vaccination, visit to cardiologist who had precribed verampamil for palpitations a few days before my vaccination - my legs and feet were swollen.   She told me I had mild purpura and edema from the verampamil, and she discontinued it. I told her I suspected it was from the vaccine.   I quit taking verampamil, and I still have the rashes and edema in my legs and feet, and also on my arms.    I had to go to the ER for severe leg pain, I believe in March orApril, where they tested me for a blood clot, which was negative, and went away a few days later.    I still have the swelling and edema and rashes.   I do not have a doctor&#39;s appointment until September with the cardiologist NP, and in October with my PCP.    I am sure my situation is from the vaccine.

                                                After the second  Moderna dose, a day later I exhibited severe neck pain - this lasted for 2  one-half weeks before it subsided. I did not go to the doctor but was very worried about it. I am 5&#39;2&#34; tall, weigh 100 lbs. and in excellent health. I am very active, ride my bike, go to water aerobics, and walk - this reaction was very debilitating; I am concerned about taking a booster shot and feel that the dosage should be adjusted based on weight as I had the same dosage a much heavier person would receive. Please consider this issue in the  future if a booster is needed. Thank you.

She cannot recall words and is experiencing delirium. Both her internist and her neurologist are convinced it was the result of the vaccine e.

I want you to be aware of this snd if it does not resolve I may sue the federal government and moderna. Thanks a llot

No pain in a sitting or standing position. the pain happens at night when lying down often followed by cramping and &#34;charlie horse&#34;  symptoms. This has lessened somewhat after 2 weeks, but it does still happens. Really considering declining the second vaccine as that is reported to be much more likely to have side effects.

                                                Patient had small localized reaction for 2 days after injection that cleared. At approximately 7 days post injection she began to have another localized reaction that included reddness, swelling, pain, heat, and a dry skin tecture that progressed to cover the lateral aspect of upper left arm from shoulder to elbow. At time of examination by RN, the patient reports that size and intensity have been increasing for about 7 days.  Patient finds relief in hot shower.  No other treatments attempted at time of exam. Patient reported area may be improving, but she is unsure.   Area was outlined with marker by RN and patient was advised to see PCP for treatment if area increased in size and was not continuing to improve.  Counseled on using OTC benadryl cream if there was itching.

Approximately 3 days later, she noted a bump that was sore to touch and slightly itchy.  It slowly got better.  She did apply clobetasol ointment on January 24 and 25.  It seemed better.  On January 28 the evening and 8 noticed some redness.  She saw me, her doctor, on January 29.  She had a 7 x 7 cm round pink area that was slightly warm and minimally tender.  This was at the site of injection.  It was slightly swollen. I did not give her the vaccine.  She got it through the health Department.

                                                The first day felt fine, the next day when she got up in the morning she didn&#39;t feel well, but felt well enough to put a roast in the crockpot.  Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

I could not even turn over in bed without my  whole body hurting. I don?t know if I had a fever or not.  I was so tired, but shaking with chills and body hurting I couldn?t go to sleep.  Put more blankets on and took 2 Tylenol.  I was able to eventually go to sleep.  I felt better in the morning but was very tired during the day.   It felt like I had covid again.  I had the same symptoms then.  I tested positive for covid November 27 at a rehab/nursing home where I was sent  after foot surgery.

                                                After administration of the Covid-19 vaccine I had 2-3 days of chills, muscle aches, fatigue, sore arm.  Symptoms gradually went away.  Then about the  7th day I started experiencing an itchy arm and a 6 inch circle of intense red at the injection site, with a wide band of white surrounding it, that itched unbelievably, was hot and swollen.  That lasted for several days, then began to subside and now is only slightly red, itches some and is no longer swollen or hot.   My question is:  Is it safe for me to get the 2nd dose, after experiencing this kind of reaction?

On the way to theER my eye felt like it had sand in it and I had to hold my hand over it and my mouth and lips felt like I had a shot of novicane and it was hard to pronounce certain words. I have  to eat small things because it is difficult puttinng food in my mouth and I can not feel the food in my mouth on the right side and if food gets over there it gets  between my gums and my cheek,  to drink I  have to position a straw in my mouth on a certain point  and some goes back down in the straw.

Prior to the injection, she would have small tremors in hands and legs on occasion but not as severe as she was experiencing afterwards.  Patient was examined and had normal vital signs, O2 saturations of 93% on room air (hx of Copd), and was negative for stroke evaluation.  We placed her on her own 02 which she generally has on when short of breath, and ECG showed a sinus rhythm with a bundle branch block.  We continued to monitor the patient which she stated her symptoms where &#34;better&#34; but continued to have sporadic Parkinson&#39;s like tremors which facility stated was more significant than normal.  It was decided that the patient would be warrant an emergency room evaluation.  The patient was transported to hospital.

                                                Severe leg cramps.   It felt like many muscles in my legs and toes were cramping at once.  Legs were painfully bending and twisting Could barely walk.   Very difficult to try to relieve them as motion to relieve one cramp made others worse.   Lasted about 45 minutes.   After about 15 minutes I took a cyclobenziprene I&#39;d had for a back spasm about a year ago.    After seeing a report of a woman with severe seizure-like leg spasms I decided to report my experience.   I am concerned about taking dose #2 scheduled for March 4.

                                                30 Hours after the shot without any warning or ill effects, I suddenly collapsed from my chair at the dining room table.  Fell on the floor unconscious and ended up in the Emergency room with a broken nose ,concussion, and no memory of the episode.  Hospital did a CAT scan which did not show indication of a stroke but did verify concussion and broken nose.  Later saw personal physician and heart monitor was placed on my body, and echo cardiogram scheduled.  Echo cardiogram did not indicate any blockage.  Results from heart monitor not available at this time.  I am a perfectly healthy individual - walk 3-4 miles every day, swim, play golf, eat a keto diet and have never had an episode like this.  An hour before it oc   Apple watch 6 texted a message that read:  &#34;are you okay or should we call 911&#34;.    I was perfectly fine and just thought the message was a fluke - replied I am fine.  An hour later the episode occured.  I am not used to taking vaccines - no flu shots, no shingles shots - only keep up my tetanus.  The only vaccine I have had recently was in 2009 - yellow fever shot so I could travel to.  I have never had a reaction like the one after the Moderna vaccine.

At 10:00 pm I started to get extremely cold and could not get warm. At 10:45 my upper body started shaking very, very bad. I couldn&#39;t control the shaking and my teeth were chattering.  I had to lay down and put my arms under my body to keep them from shaking and I was so cold even though I was wearing warm things and under a comforter.  The shaking lasted an hour and a half. I took my temperature  during the night and it was 102. I am very week this morning, temp. is 99.9.  I was expecting the temperature and pain in the injection site but I can&#39;t find out anywhere on line whether the uncontrollable shaking was normal for the second shot.  .

                                                I had Soreness on the arm the same day of vaccination, redness, achy in the muscle area on my arm. I think the injection was administrated to high in my arm.  The within the next 24-48 hours I had a headache and was tired. About the 4th-5th day I had tingling, prickly feeling across right shoulder, down both arms down to my fingers and down  my legs down to my toes. This lasted about 5-10 minutes. Then on the 16th it happened again but this time it was my whole body the torso area and my limbs. I also had weakness, I felt like I needed to hold onto to someone to be able to stand. I had an unstable feeling while standing. The headache has occurred on and off since time of vaccination  about 4-5 times.  I  went doctor on Tuesday 2/16/2021, I did not see my doctor this time I see a different  it was a lady doctor.  She wasn&#39;t aware of this being one of the side effects and just to monitor myself and return if the symptoms worsen. She thought it was safe to get the 2nd dose. I have a virtual visit scheduled with Dr. on 2/23/2023

By 7pm I was dizzy and nauseated, and it got worse, I got chills and shook and shook and shook, I had a fever and the next day I tried to get out of bed, and I fell to the floor and couldn?t stand up, I had no energy or appetite. I had covid in August 2020 and the wasn?t made aware of the possible side effects if you had covid. They didn?t ask if I had covid in the past and the pharmacist told me later that people who has had covid has reported having bad side effects. I had gone a couple weeks ago to see if I had the covid antibodies and I was positive for antibodies and the injection works against the antibiotics. This part of the procedure was overlooked. I have no one else to help me and going through this alone, it would have been better to have been made aware of this ahead of time.

                                                Four days after injection right foot became inflamed and hugely swollen.  Top of foot and all along the outside side of it both on top and at bottom of foot all very painful. Ankle and leg very swollen and painful. Can&#39;t walk on foot.  As of 2/26/2021  swelling is not as bad and not so discolored but still some swelling and redness burning and very painful and still cannot use the foot.  Also have noticed places where  I have had surgery or injuries is hurting and being stiff. Am questioning whether or not I should get the 2nd shot. Concerned it will make situation even worse.

Client advised to try Benadryl and check in with physician if needed. Client reports she has not had anything new to eat, but did have a yogurt with fruit from the local senior center and she does have a soy allergy. Follow up on 2/26/21 client explains that she took benedryl at 1600 on 2/24/21, again at 2000, went to bed, and woke on 2/25/21 and took a 3rd dose. Client reports that at that time the swelling was improved and she has not had any symptoms since.

By day #7, I called my dr who wasn&#39;t in and spoke to his associate. She said if it got worse to follow up with my dr. They continued to get worse and by Day #9, I called my doctor and sent him a photo. He told me to take benedryl and an antihistamine (zyrtec).  By the next day, the lips were worse, sent another photo and he prescribed Prednisone 20 mg for 5 days. I had a lot of trouble eating and drinking. My lips also felt like pins were constantly being stuck in them. The prednisone helped but it took at least another week before my lips returned to normal. On the advice of my doctor, I did not get the second Moderna dose.

                                                After the second shot, I expected mild side effects and experienced some: mild headache, sore left arm around injection site, fatigue, brain fog. I was walking to my garage with a small package of papers when suddenly my lower back spasmed sharply. The pain was intense. I thought it would subside so I managed, with difficulty, to make it into my car. When I was seated in the car, the spasms subsided. I considered not driving to my two errands but decided that I felt well enough seated in the car to drive and deliver the papers to my tax preparer  and the carful of donations to Goodwill. At the tax office, I called an assistant to come to the parking lot to pick up the papers, which she did. At Goodwill, one of the attendants emptied my car. When I got home at about 10:50, I had to call my husband to help me into the house. I spent the next several hours in agony (11 on a scale of 1-10) with spasms, punctuated by absolutly not moving. The spasms were so bad I could not breathe. My doc prescribed a muscle relaxer, then the next day prednisone, which has helped. Today I will have an mri to determine if the spasms herniated a disc.

At the same time I noticed a 2inch  red ring around the injection site. The next day I felt fine ,but had a very sore arm with the red circle and a large pink blush running down to my elbow which never disappeared. The following week the red circle disappeared but the pink blush remained. On Sunday, 02/28 I noted that the blush disappeared but I now had a 3inch red circle around the injection site. On Monday 03/1, the red circle grew and spread, and by 03/2 it was no longer in circular form but spread down my arm to 3inches by 6inches. It remains the same 0n 0/3. It is not painful or itchy. I am worried. I know this is called covid arm but my reaction does seem extreme. I do have some photos beginning on 02/28

She took 2 Tylenol, and went back and laid down.  She then awoke the next day starting to have some chills but not as bad as the night before.  She covered up with an electric  blanket in a chair and finally passed over.  She noticed  Saturday that she had nausea and dizziness.  She then had  tenderness in her mouth, used warm salty water which seems to be helping.  She cannot eat any hard food on it due to the discomfort.  She has continued nausea in the evenings.  No problems with the arm where she got the vaccine.  She feels it it getting some better, but the dizziness and nausea is the worst issue.  She did call her doctor and they told her that they could not give her anything for the rash in her mouth, and the chills. They told her that it had to run it&#39;s course.

Too weak to make it to the bathroom by myself.  I felt like I was in a delirium but my husband said that I was not incoherent.  Appetite is still not normal.  Mouth was so dry that I was not able to feel any moisture at all which I feel led to my sinus infection.

It is about 2&#43; inches wide and 3&#43;inches long. Still quite red and tender to touch. Muscle underneath the injection site is still tender. It has been eight days since the injection. I also experienced some lethargy for the first two or three days.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 04-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown), intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06-Feb-2021, approximately 48 hours after vaccination, the patient developed allergic reaction and had hives all over her body. The patient received diphenhydramine for hives. The patient also stated that inside of her was burning, face swelled up, lips swelled up and throat swelled up. The patient rushed to emergency room (ER). They needed to take the patient to an allergist because they wanted to find out if this was related to the vaccine. The allergist told her that they couldn&#39;t do an allergy testing. The patient asked if there were any reports on people showing allergic reaction 48 hours later after the vaccine. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, allergic reaction, hives all over her body, face swelled up, lips swelled up, throat was swelled up, and burning, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The next morning, she was confused, had tremors in all 4 extremities, was weak, unable to bear weight, and unable to walk.  She remained in this state and bedbound for 3 days.  Her husband considered taking her to the ER but was concerned that she would be alone and unable to advocate for herself due to severe confusion.  She gradually regained strength and tremors resolved after 1-2 weeks.

The pt&#39;s episode lasted for about 5 min.  She was sitting on  her  wheelchair and her daughter was speaking to her and holding her hand and head.  Patient was responding to her daughter when daughter ask if pt can hear her.  Patient did say she saw wavy lines while she was having an episode. They left after she felt fine and I spoke to daughter later that evening and daughter said that patient didn&#39;t feel tired after they got home  and was eating her dinner. Daughter did speak to her mom&#39;s neurologist about the seizure that happened with the first shot and md recommended pt get second dose and not sure why she had a seizure.

She went to the ER with no treatment. About 5-6 hours after discharged she returned with her leg turning purple and uncontrollable pain. She was diagnosed with venous thromboembolis and transferred to a larger facility where she underwent lytic therapy and venous angioplasty. She is having to go for venous stenting in the next two weeks. She continues to have pain in her leg, chronic fatigue and weakness, as well as being lightheaded with a stable BP (no orthostasis). She has been diagnosed with anemia since vaccination and is being worked up for that.

This became worse over the Easter weekend and I went to  clinic on April 6, 2021. I had a superficial blood clot just above the knee on the inner aspect of my left leg. After that appointment the redness and soreness and very hard feeling of the veins extended up my leg 8 to 10 inches. I did not have a blood clots in the deep veins. I have had some varicose vein?s  and surgery for such about five years ago. The clinic did not say the clot was due to the vaccine but I had no injuries, no recent surgeries and nothing unusual that would have caused the clot other than the vaccine

Now (7 weeks from shot, am still &#34;aware&#34; of lips and cheeks - not exactly swollen, but like an injury that is not completely healed - this occurs when I am &#34;tensed up&#34; about something (l trying to get to an appointment on time :)

I am walking with a cane, using a grabber, can&#39;t bend over to anything below table height.  I didn&#39;t drive for 2 weeks, now afraid to leave town. on my own.  Since I am prone to these episodes, I wasn&#39;t too concerned, because they do pass, BUT I am still having the issue, daily. I understand that so many unknowns are with the Covid-19 vaccination.  My hope is that this DOES pass and I don&#39;t have to live with it the rest of my life!  Thank you for taking my symptoms.

                                                She got her vaccine, she had a different person than the first one and didn&#39;t even feel anything and was fine.  With this one she felt when she was stuck with the needle.  She got a flush of heat that went down to her elbow.  She stayed there for the allotted time period and went home.  She got up the next morning, the first she realized that she could hardly stand up due to the pain and aching everywhere.  She then started getting chills, and went in to eat and not able to eat, but no appetite.  She laid around all day and started taking her temperature and the last time she took it it was 100, then didn&#39;t take it after that.  She had a massive headache, in fact that evening she put an ice pack on her head as was told not to take Tylenol.  She states that this lasted all day, she went to bed early and the next day had exhaustion, unable to do anything, took it easy.  She did have her appetite back, and was able to eat.  By the 3rd day she was back to her normal self.    She did call the paramedics to ask questions as they are around the corner, and they told her to wait 24 hours and see if it resolved, which she did.

By 16 hours she had all-over body aches and a migraine, treated with 4x Motrin 200 mg tabs with good improvement by 28 hours.  Chills again at 36 hours and some shoulder and low back muscle aches, treated with 3 x Motrin 200 mg tabs.  She did well the rest of day 2.  Day 3 started by feeling well, but by 9 am she felt cold, weak, and nauseated.  I covered her with multiple blankets and a heating pad and lay her in bed.   About an hour later she felt less nauseated but still cold.

                                                I felt fine after my vaccination until about midnight. I felt weak, and generally sick - horrible. I felt like I had a fever and I felt like my heart was still thumping too hard. I felt nauseas and generally all over sick as a dog, weak as a kitten. And I was afraid as well, because it was midnight and I live alone. I thought about going to the ER due to my condition. I took my BP and it was 120/68 which is normal. I took my temperature and it was 96.7 and then I did my blood oxygen and it was 96 with a heart rate of 66 so all of my little at home tests were normal. I was no longer afraid. I took two baby aspirin and I drank a lot of water and I went to sleep. I did not feel good in the morning but due to my vitals being okay, I began to stop worrying. Around noon the day after my vaccine, I felt OK. I contacted my DR the next day and they called me back and I was fine at that point so said nevermind.

On the 2nd day after I noticed a loud hissing sound in both ears. It has now been 60 days with NO RELIEF! I have undergone comprehensive hearing exam which shows hearing loss &amp;  Tinnitus. Both are now permanent.  There is no treatment and the outcome is bleak:  Loss of hearing, constant hissing in ears and extreme sensitivity to touch - skin turns to bright red welts if scratched at all &amp; welts last about 20 minutes. All body parts head to toe.

There was lump at the injection site.  Then she felt like she had a lightening strike through her body, and felt like she had the flu the next day.  She could not move and it lasted only a day and she stayed in the bed, and it went away.  She had a low grade temp of 100, normal temp 97.  She then woke up on Wednesday with a rash at the injection site to the elbow but used hydrocortisone cream which did not release the pain and used a cold compress to remove the heat from her arm.  The cortisone cream did not work and she called the doctor who prescribed Benadryl cream and Benadryl to take (allergic to).  Cream worked, Benadryl made her sick so now lists that as an allergy.  She then took Claritin and it worked, but the rash remained.  She got a rash then on the back of her right thigh, and she had hives on both knees (one on each knee and on the elbows).  The rash on her arm was there and had to use cold compresses and eventually by Friday of that week it subsided .  Annoying due to the itching, but not painful.  The rash on the thigh went away the next day.  Also had rash on her buttocks, which went away the next day as well.   Has been fine since the Friday after the vaccine.    She saw her doctor who told her to take the shot, her son is a Dr. and they told her to take it.   All of her family members and friends had no reactions.

Dull ache at site of injection.  These both began approximately a month after the second shot and continue to this day.  I asked my internist about this and she is experiencing the same things!  Amazing.  She said it&#39;s from the vaccine and not a new medical issue with my body.

I contacted my DR about 5-7 days after it began, it was so long ago how am I supposed to remember the dates. The DR gave me a 7 day supply of Cortisone. After that it began to go down, although I did have pain in the arm and around the arm as well, which was constant and is still there for that matter actually. The DR just said it was an allergic reaction to the shot.

The next day I had a steroid injection in both knees , the day after the steroid,  my injection site and shoulder were fine. Also I had the hot flashes and flushes. Possibly from steroid, or the vaccine, is the steroid masking the reaction to the vaccine? Will the steroid negate the effects of the vaccine on my immune system?

Pain was intermittent, coming and going but taking my breath away. I called CVS about aspirin and took 5 Baby Bayer aspirins. Pain went away at around 9 pm. Never returned. NO  other adverse effects  Surprising result is diminished pain in knees! When it gets cold, rainy, my knees have been extremely painful so I&#39;d have to lift myself up from sitting but since then the pain is at 1 to 2 on the scale rather than 10 ! It sounds strange but it has happened and that&#39;s why I felt I needed to report this.  Rainy days this week with no debilitating pain and I waited to report this for a week since the pain usually began days before.

January 22 - noticed injection site had a 3&#34; x 1 1/2&#34; red place and warm to touch.  Doctor said to ice it and take Zrytec and  put Benadryl cream on it.  January 23 - not as red, but a little sore.  Had some diarrhea, but don&#39;t know if that is what it is from.

                                                Day of injection arm a little sore. Next day (Friday) felt perfectly fine and spent the day at home doing usual house cleaning and laundry. Felt fine in the evening and Saturday morning was extremely fatigued, loss of equilibrium, and elevated blood pressure. This condition remained for a few days and on Tuesday my pressure was somewhat down and I saw my doctor. He suggested that since I was doing a little better had NO other symptoms such as fever or chills or muscle aches I would be better in time. It was a rough week feeling so unlike my self but I pushed through. I see the doctor again on Tuesday the 26th. I have never had any reaction to any other vaccine such as flu or shingles vaccine at any time. I am an active woman who exercises and walks to the beach near my home frequently every week. I am anxious about the second dose of the vaccine. I have an appointment on Thursday, February 4th. Hopefully all my strength will have returned by then. I feel like I&#39;m still only 80% back to normal. I have spoken to a young woman who called me back. I would like very much to speak with a medical person who can give me some feedback on my response to the vaccine. That would be reassuring that I am not alone with these side effects. Thank you.

On 05 Jan 2021, the patient woke up real sweaty at 3 am. She got up and went to the bathroom and passed out. The patient reported that she fell on the commode then got to the floor because she felt weak and could not walk. Once she regained her strength, she returned to bed.   On 07 Jan 2021, the patient reported that her arm was still sore at the injection site and continued to feel weak. Treatment information was not provided.

Finally able to get to my feet and stumbled trying to notify 911. Stumbled to room closest  the front door. Husband opened front door for EMS. For about  1 hour I sat and my whole body trembled. Finally the thrashing about slowed down and stopped. Today I am very tired and achey.

THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

                                                Had reaction in November to tetanus vaccine.  Had flu vaccine with no reaction.  Then had this vaccine, no reaction initially, came home, feeling fine but an hour later had flushing in her left ear, just creeping over to her eye and the side of her face.  This lasted for about 15 minutes and left the feeling of something not quite right around her eye.  Nothing compared to her reaction in November from a tetanus booster.  Still has the feeling but not an adverse reaction.  Then at 10:00 PM all of a sudden her face went really hot, and presumed she had a fever, started feeling badly.  Started walking around the house, took Tylenol.  That feeling lasted for about 30 minutes and resolved.  Went to bed and did not feel anything but a funny feeling.  All symptoms have subsided except for a weird feeling around her eye.

                                                On 1/28/2021, starting having severe pain in chest/lungs and especially a quarter size area above rib cage located on top of right breast next to breast bone. This area was especially painful when pressure applied. No shortness of breath.  Symptoms lasted for about 10 hours and  subsided somewhat on 1/29/2021.  Severe pain symptoms returned early morning on 1/30/2021 and resulted in my going to the ER at the local hospital around 10:00 a.m.  An EKG , CT scan, and blood tests determined no heart attack or other life threatening conditions and I was released from the hospital around 4:00 p.m., still experiencing pain without a cause being determined.  Pain and painful area were no longer present on 1/31/2021.

                                                On 8th day after Moderna Covid 19 injection, there was a very raised, red area on left arm - felt very warm.  By the next day  the area had increased in size and some of the swelling had subsided.  Today, the third day after the reaction appeared, the redness has spread to  a large part of the outside of my upper arm - still feels warm -slight pain.  Previous to this side effect, I felt a loss of strength in my left arm during a workout. ( My concern is that this occurred so late after the injection and what it means going forward with second injection.) I have called my doctor but have not talked to him.

She has pain in the bend of her left knee that radiates down through the calf of her leg.  When she gets up from sitting it hurts, and having to use two canes to walk and it still hurts.

I have osteoarthritis in my left knee and right hip as well as a left hip  replacement and right knee replacement I thought perhaps the pain I experienced was weather related as I had not experience pain in these joints like this before.  I went to bed that night about 9 p.m. and was experiencing more pain in my legs.  The pain kept me awake most of the night and I got up about 4:30 a.m. By then I could barely walk.  The pain was not only in my joints but felt like it was in my bones as well.  My skin on the lower leg felt tight, almost like my legs were swollen, but they did not appear to be.  My right leg hurt the worst.   I still have a discolored spot on my arm where I had the shot.  It is about a 1/2&#34; diameter.  It does not hurt.

                                                Patient presented to the pharmacy questioning possible adverse reactions to the COVID vaccine. After a little discussion with a technician, I was summoned to evaluate the patient. Patient received the 1st dose of COVID vaccine on 2/11/2021; she reported significant arm tenderness in the arm that received the inoculation, however, she reported the soreness was improving. Patient&#39;s left arm appeared red &amp; warm to touch. Although it did not appear inundated and lacked tracking, I encouraged patient to contact her primary care doctor&#39;s office for evaluation. Patient followed my recommendation and I consulted with the provider. The conclusion was made that patient appears to be having an immune response to the vaccine yet. Dr also consulted with RN (immunizations)  and she reported this reaction has not been uncommon 5 dose post-vaccination. Patient was instructed to apply cold compresses now and again after receiving the 2nd dose. We do not believe any contraindication exists for the 2nd dose at this time, and patient is encouraged to receive the 2nd dose on 3/11/2021 as scheduled.

Felt pretty much over it by Feb 21 but still some weakness and fatigue.  Also a very sore arm that turned pink and feb 22 is still sore and pink and itchy but not as bad as the previous days.  I have always gotten a sore arm with flu shots but not as bad as this time so I didn&#39;t consider that a bad reaction.

                                                Really tired on Monday the 22nd and I felt fatigued. I began to get nauseated and then I began to vomit. I vomited 5-6 times even though I had not eaten anything. I also had diarrhea. I had chills. Some point during the night I spiked a fever, I woke up and drenched. Yesterday  the 23rd I  had a fever, my stomach still does not feel settled. I have not ate much since Sunday but have been trying to stay hydrated with lots of water.  I also developed a cough yesterday. Tuesday night my temperature 100.6 and I think it got higher because I woke up once again drenched in sweat. This morning my temperature was 99.  I am achy today with muscle and joint pain,  my stomach feels better but I still leery of  eating. I did eat some Ginger ale and eat some saltine crackers.  I also feel horse.  I called my doctor yesterday and still have not heard back. I will call again today.  It feels like I feel better in the morning but as the day goes on I get worse and start feeling worse. I have been resting a lot in bed.

Then had headaches off and on, as well as muscle and joint pain everywhere, weakness all over her body.  She also had a low grade fever Saturday and Sunday.  She did have the  Corona Virus in July of 2020.  She is feeling better today as far as the weakness, just a little bit of muscle and joint pain.  She did have a trace of nausea this morning, but took her medication and it subsided.  The weakness was something like she had never had before.  She took Tylenol for her symptoms.  She did not call her doctor.   Just has a small amount of symptoms, but still not feeling herself yet.

A lot of pain (7-8) unable to sleep on that side and unable to lift more than two pounds or drive or reach above my shoulder without pain of about a 10 on scale of 1-10.  Saw orthapedic physician assistant  on 03/26   who gave me a steroid shot in that shoulder with 75%  relief by the next day. Still some minor residual discomfort at this writing.  Also ran a fever with nausea and headache exactly two weeks after first shot.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications were reported.    On 19-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 032L20a) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 19-Feb-2021, the patient received the vaccine around noon and by the evening she could tell things were going downhill. She went to bed early, and throughout the night the injection site was painful, she was fatigued, she had muscle pain, joint pain, nausea without vomiting, and a low grade fever. The patient got up at night to go to the bathroom and got dizzy and passed out. She said she was passed our for barely a minute and when she came too she laid there for a bit before she went back to bed with her husband&#39;s help. All day on Saturday 20-Feb-2021 the patient was in bed but by that evening she was able to get up and walk out of the bedroom. On Sunday night 21-Feb-2021, she was able walk up stairs without huffing and puffing and felt much better. The patient states they have recovered from it all except sometimes when doing yoga, they can feel a bit of an ache in the injection arm.  No treatment information was provided.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event(s); therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event(s) is not applicable.  The outcome of the events things were going downhill, injection site was painful, fatigued, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea without vomiting, low grade fever, dizzy, and passed out, were considered recovered/resolved.    The outcome of the event, ache in injection arm, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 79 Y/O F with a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness along with NS unexpected dizziness, feeling abnormal, pain in extremity, and NS expected fever, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vaccination site pain. Event onset the same day as second dose mRNA-1273. Events resolved except arm pain. Based on current available information and temporal association between use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient came with husband to Vaccine clinic today 3/5 for 2nd dose of vaccine. Did well during and immediately after vaccine. Husband states patient has c/o severe chest pressure and pain for several weeks but has refused to come to ER for evaluation. Today, after getting vaccine dose and going to local bank, patient was in passenger side of truck when chest pain started again. Husband begged patient to let him take her to the ER but she said no, I?m fine and I don?t want to go. She then went unresponsive. At a stop light, he was next to a couple of cops who he was able to wave down and proceed to escort them in to ER. Upon arrival to the ER, patient was unresponsive and pulseless. CPR was initiated, 1 defib, and 1mg of epi was given. Return of pulse was obtained, but husband asked for no life support and only comfort measures. Patient was admitted for comfort measures.  I do NOT think this was related to her vaccine, but rather the unfortunately end to a sub-acute chest pain patient that declined multiple urgings to seek care.  Patient then expired on 3/5/21 at 2037.

                                                I became progressively more sleepy the afternoon after the vaccination, as expected.  I did get up and make dinner, then went to bed at 9:15 p.m. on March 8th and slept until 9:15 a.m. March 9th.  I felt unstable walking into the bathroom to urinate, and even more unstable waking into the kitchen to take my meds. I passed out and woke up on the floor.  I was weak but managed to pull myself up holding on to the kitchen range. I headed for the living room sofa and passed out again, waking up on the floor by the sofa.  I&#39;m guessing I was unconscious about 2 minutes each time, but don&#39;t really know. I lay down on the sofa and called a neighbor.  He thought I should call 911, and they came and drove me to  ER .  They did an EKG, chest x-ray, and CAT scan of my brain, and drew blood.  All results were normal. I returned home that same day (March 9)  and had little energy, and ate lightly.  When I was getting in bed about 10:30 p.m. I let my head drop on the pillow and the room started to whirl around me for about six seconds.  Sometimes when I roll over in bed during the night there is a pause before   it feels like the room gives one spin.  My scalp is very tender in the large area where I hit it twice when passing out.  I&#39;m taking it easy again today, but do feel a little stronger.  I am normally exceptionally healthy for my age, and work , traveling to destinations to research and photograph my articles. Both the travel and article take stamina, and I thrive on the work.

Her only new pain at this time is to her left ankle, feeling well otherwise, no recent Rx changes, generally poor intake per daughter. No other new concerns today. No change in chronic lower back pain.   Addendum;  COVID screen &#43; which could account for her weakness in her legs past 24 hours.

                                                The patient stated that she gets paralyzed after getting vaccines.  I asked her if she had someone in the pharmacy to help her. She said she came alone.  I told her I would have her wait 30mins after dose to make sure there were no issues. After I gave her the shot, she looked at me and said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. Then she looked and said my neck hurts. So I had her take deep breaths with me to get her to calm down as she appeared anxious. She was doing great then she went limp. I held her head up and asked her is she was ok.   She said she was, but then her breathing become shallow. She was un responsive at this time with her tongue pushing her mask off her mouth.  So I lowered her mask and her tongue appeared to be enlarged.  I had my technician call 911 and I gave her a dose of epinephrine 0.3 mg.   She was unresponsive, but breathing on her own.  The paramedics came and got her vitals, placed her on stretcher, and put in a medicine line to give her medications if need be.  She left somewhat unresponsive. They said she should be fine  and took her to ER.

After 15 minutes, I left the pharmacy, could drive my car and felt only slight dizziness.  However, the tongue and lips continued to feel burning/prickly for the rest of the day.  I did not  report this to the pharmacy.  If the 2nd shot does this again, I will report it to them.

I had put some lotion on it and it did not itch. I was given antibiotics. The doctor thought it was moving down my arm. They drew a circle around it, and it did not grow. It slowly went down over the course of a week. I got the second dose, and I was poorly for two and a half days. My arm was not affected by the second dose. I did have a low appetite for a month after the second shot. LOT # 024M20A

I don&#39;t remember being dizzy or lightheaded, only remember going to the toilet and then waking up and wondering why I was lying on the bathroom rug.   I would very much like to know if other people have passed out the day after getting the vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  On early morning of 04/02/2021 arm became very discolored (mostly bright red/scarlet color) between elbow and just below vaccination injection site.  Through the course of the weekend arm became worse but the initial pain changed to irritation/itching primarily.  On 04/05/2021 at 6 a.m. upon wakening arm was still vividly discolored but my blood pressure reading first thing was high (197/99 with a 90 pulse) which is very unusual for me now.  Not only that but I also experience at same time a nose bleed.  Since other than assuming in general that the arm discoloration connected somehow to the vaccination I had no idea if the spike in BP also connected and the nose bleed (since I rarely have any nose bleeds) I went to the ER - which is a small county hospitals about 3 miles from my home.  I did not attempt to take a Clonidine at home before going there as I wanted them to see if there was a connection between these 3 issues.  Upon arrival my blood pressure was taken again and it was the same high numbers as  at home not long before.  The ER doctor on duty that morning unfortunately didn&#39;t seem to  know what might be wrong with my arm and so she focused on bringing down my blood pressure by instructing a nurse to give me a Clonidine.  Within about a half hour when my BP had returned to normal they dismissed me to go home without any actual information as to whether the 3 issues were connected of not and without obviously having a clue as to what the situation was with my arm.   During the course of the day my daughter did some research on the internet and determined that it must be &#39;COVID Arm&#39; that I was suffering from.  First thing the next morning (04/03/21) I called my GP doctor&#39;s office to try to get an appointment but unfortunately he was fully booked and so instead I called the the local Health Department and spoke with one of the nurses who works in their COVID Vaccination program.  On telling her of my experiences she confirmed that it sounded very much like COVID Arm.

                                                One week after the first Moderna shot on 1.28.21, I experienced severe upper body pains, aches on shoulders, arms, fingers, continuing to date: 4.13.21.  My concern is that the Moderna vaccine stimulated an underlying &amp; unknown arthritic condition, diagnosed via xray on 4.8.21.  The disabling pain continues, even after the 2nd shot, 3.4.21, which I listed in item 4, so that I could include the first shot as happening one month prior in item 22.

By 5th day all okay, except some cognitive issues (slower thinking, searching for words, poor memory) still with me on May 3, these are subtle changes, but it&#39;s obvious to me they began after this vaccine shot.

Diagnosed as inflammation and bursitis in left hip, which still remains in May and limits my life in the extreme.

She described the pain as a throbbing pain with a &#34;boom&#34; that would come every few seconds. It was painful to touch that side of her head. The discomfort kept the patient disoriented for a few days where she was only just today (05/12/21) able to report the pain. She said as time has passed that the duration between the throbbing (or &#34;booming&#34;) seemed to get longer and she thinks it is getting better. Tylenol has provided some relief.

Treatment team Severe sepsis (CMS/HCC) Principal problem Discharge Summary Internal Medicine    Inpatient DeathSummary   BRIEF OVERVIEW Admission Date: 4/6/2021     Discharge Date: 4/17/2021  DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY   Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Patient is an 79 y.o. female morbidly obese with past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia follow-up that was initially scheduled oncology follow-up for April 7 now postponed to the next 2 weeks, COPD on 2 L oxygen support at home, GERD, depression and anxiety.  She was recently seen in the ED on April 4, 2021 with complaint of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, fever, chills, nonbloody diarrhea, vomiting and weakness and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.  She had however received a second dose of COVID-19 a week before and was  discharged home due to lack of significant findings on imaging chest x-ray and lack of requirement for higher  oxygen support. She presented to the emergency via EMS for evaluation of progressive shortness of breath with associated with fever, chills, headache, persistent shortness of breath, cough productive of thick clear sputum, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  She denies abdominal pain, chest pain, or dizziness.  Denies recent antibiotic usage or recent travel.  Apparently, she thought she was getting better upon discharge after being kept for about 12 hours in the last ED visit, however she was not feeling well after going to bed last night and asked the husband to call 911.  Upon EMS arrival patient was saturating in the 80s and in respiratory distress.  She received 1 DuoNeb and was eventually placed on 10 L oxygen support.  She was noted to be in significant respiratory distress during speech.   Hospital Course Patient was admitted to hospital due to shortness of breath, and was found to have severe sepsis on presentation due to COVID-19 pneumonia.  She had evidence of acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure as well.  She was started on IV antibiotics, as well as remdesivir and Decadron at high dose.   Unfortunately she continued to have clinical deterioration, and ultimately required high flow oxygen therapy.  She was then transferred to the ICU, and ultimately required intubation due to severe profound ongoing hypoxia despite optimal medical treatment.  She did not respond to remdesivir or steroids or antibiotics.  Post intubation, she also developed acute renal failure during the course of her admission.   Multiple discussions were had throughout the hospitalization regarding goals of care, and initially patient and family wish to be continually aggressive.  She received full medical treatment, including life support, with minimal improvement.  Despite being on ventilator for roughly 5 days, she continued to have severe hypoxia.  She was proned, and was unable to sustain oxygen saturations when supine even for short period.   Her renal function continued to decline as well, and at that point discussion was had with family regarding goals of care again.  They were explained that symptoms continue to be persistent, and her illness continues to progress despite aggressive medical therapy.  Ultimately decision was made to not pursue dialysis, and to allow the patient to be kept comfortable and pass away naturally from this infection.   She was terminally extubated on 4/17 and passed away at 11:16 AM due to COVID-19 and acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure.

She had even gotten her annual labs done recently which came back all with in normal range, she as far as we knew did not have any issues with her heart.  After her first vaccination in March she started to lose interest in things and didn&#39;t have energy to be as active as she was.  After the second shot with in two days she started to report pain in chest and head and trouble breathing,  She went to her PCP on 5/12 and he wanted her to go to a cardiologist, this referral was made but by the 16th she was in the ER due to extreme chest pain and trouble breathing, a stent was placed in her heart on 4/17/21 my mom&#39;s 80th birthday.   with in 4 days she died.  Her heart just deteriorated. i feel that if she didn&#39;t get this shot she would be alive today, she was healthy, now she is dead.

Patient seemed fine with no distress. Color normal. I came back into the pharmacy and seen patient doing well. Patient then a couple minutes later stood up and took a couple steps which put her out of my view. technician the asked if she was ok and the I could see the shot booth going  sideways. Then I could see her fall. I then ran out the pharmacy to check and she landed in the chair sitting up right. she was still semi-conscious and I talked to her. I got a pulse and told the technician to call an ambulance. while trying to keep the lady awake she drifted unconscious but was breathing ok. Pulse was low but didn&#39;t lose. Had the help of a nurse at this time and ambulance arrived. Patient was awake by this point with drowziness and could talk.

                                                She got her vaccine, she felt very weak, woozy, tired, lethargic.  Her blood pressure went up to 196/116 several days later.  She was sick for 5 weeks.  Her arm was a little achy, which was normal to her as she gets allergy shots which she has the same reaction to.  She called her doctor who was out on leave and they told her to go to UC.  She went to UC twice and the ER twice due to her BP and her weakness and dizziness.  She was not able to drive due to these symptoms.  They did increase her BP medication and he said that if it did not help then go to the ER.  She went to the ER and was still feeling very weak, and they told her that it was from the vaccine as they have seen other people with the same reactions, and it can last up to 6 weeks.  She said nobody knew what happened, she had CT scan of the head, EKG, blood work, chest x-ray and other tests.  She went to the cardiologist who believed that she had the COVID virus, and he ordered an echocardiogram that was normal.  She also had a LEXI-scan that was normal as well.     The symptoms finally went away and is back to normal now and said that it was exactly 5 weeks later that she finally felt better and was not dizzy or woozy any longer.  She felt as though she was going to die as she was so weak.    She feels that it needs to be explained further that it is not FDA approved and that the elderly do not understand what EUA means.

Her husband eventually called 911 and they told him it &#34;sounded like a reaction to COVID vaccine&#34; and &#34;if she got worse they would send someone out&#34;. Pt stated these feelings lasted until about 0300 on 5/29/21 and after she fell asleep most things resolved expect the light-headedness. Pt  reports she is still fatigued and has bouts of dizziness and lightheadedness and she has no energy. Pt was encouraged to call and report her symptoms to her primary provider and seek their guidance on when to receive her second injection.

On 02/09/2021 we both got the Covid antibodies but they did not work for her. It ended up going into Covid pneumonia and she was treated for that and once she got over that she got bacterial pneumonia and we have been going through that since (still ongoing).  She has seen specialists and had a hospital stay for 9 days. She has had all kinds of blood tests. She just had a test on 06/16/2021 to see if she has an immunity to Covid. She has had overall weakness and when we took her to hospital she fainted.

                                                About 2 days after the vaccine, I notice a rash on my left arm.  It was deep pink, spotty and sensitive  to the touch.  It was 5 inches in length. I put ice on it.   I called my doctor and was prescribed an antibiotic (I can not remember the name).  I only took 2 pills because I consulted with other healthcare professional who suggested an antibiotic would not help.  The rash did started to go away.  It took several days for it to resolve.

I have been using Mucinex to relieve the mucus in my throat and Benadrl to relieve other side effects.  I have not been ill nor have I experienced any pain.  I have an allergy to bee stings but have never been on medication for it.

                                                8 days after the first dose, my Mom developed a rash at the site of the injection. It lasted for about 6 days and it was the size of the palm of a hand.  She saw her primary care Doctor on 1/25/21 for a regular physical. He saw the rash (which had subsided) and advised her to take one Benadryl 30 minutes before she has the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 2/10/21.  On 1/30/21 she had an episode where her face was tingling and she was not feeling well and a somewhat out of it. Today, 1/31/21, she is feeling better but still has tingling in her face.

It goes down to the lips.  There is pain associated with the numbness and it&#39;s concerning it hasn&#39;t gone away.   Went to internist today who said he wasn&#39;t comfortable with this outcome and suggested calling Neurologist.  Waiting on appointment.

                                                Experiencing muscle weakness in legs and arms.  Feel as if I have over-stressed those muscles, and they resist by being weak and feeling as if they sort of tremble.  I usually walk one mile a day and as I was walking the day after my injection my calf in my left leg shortly after I started began to tighten up.  At first I thought I would press on through but the muscle tensed more something like a &#34;Charlie Horse.&#34;  I quit walking came in an rested.  I have not attempted my mile walk since then because my leg muscle is still sore from the cramp.  When I raise my arms they feel heavy and seem to quiver and my legs do the same as I&#39;m doing my stretching exercises.     I have been waiting to contact anyone to see if time would take care of this problem I am having.  I am seeking guidance as to whether or not I should proceed with my second injection on 18 Feb 2021.   I am waiting for my doctor&#39;s office to respond regarding my call about this.  I did speak with a nurse at the local HD who said I should file this side effect event report with you.  I have never had a reaction to any of my flu shots and I have had one each year for a number of years.  One thing I do want to mention is that my mother took the flu shot the first year it was offered and she was one who experienced muscle loss due to it and never completely recovered muscle strength.

Also experienced moderate, intermittent occipital headache for approximately 6-7 hours following injection.  Soreness in L. arm following two days.

I also had a slightly sore arm at the injection site, but not until 9 hours after the injection at 11 PM.  Itching may be due to my  occasional eczema--I still have it, or it may have been triggered by the gel used for my heart echocardiogram on 2/12/21 or possibly by the vaccine.  The mild diarrhea was only on 2/14/21 and resolved with OTC medication.

                                                My arm was sore almost immediately after receiving the vaccine. About 3-4 days later my arm started itching. The itches goes down from my shoulder to my elbow on my left arm and my right arm the itching goes from the shoulder to the wrist. My  left arm is also red around the area where I got the shot and was swollen, this lasted about 2-3 days then it went away. In the last couple of days the redness came back and puffiness came back. I do not see any bumps but when I feel my arms they bumps. I did try to put some anti-itch cream which helped with the itching but I quit putting the cream on it as I worried if it would react with the vaccine.

The pain in my arm continued  throughout the 12th and 13th necessitating being on pain relievers. By the evening of the 13th , a 3&#34; red swollen area became apparent .  The pain continued which was annoying but did not limit my activities .   I remain puzzled as to why I responded as I did when I hadn&#39;t before; it almost appears I have a cystitis issue now.

The second day she shaking and jerking, couldn&#39;t hold on to anything.  Her blood pressure was up and down that day. She said she felt like she was dying and then she vomiting where she bruised both elbows on the toilet bowl due to the jerking movement she was experiencing.  She took a nap and woke up confused.  She was hallucinating saying she felt like she went from a small box to a blue box to red box and didnt recognize her room.  Her sitter said her eyes were glazed but was able to recognize her sitter at that time.  Blood pressure dropped so the sitter then called EMTs where they checked her out.  Vital signs were good but she declined to be transported to the hospital via ambulance.  The third day she was feeling some better where she was able to eat and get a sponge bath.  Fourth day she was better so was able to shower.  She states she is better now with just a little soreness and redness around the injection site.   Pt has contacted her PCP and spoke with the nurse about her symptoms.

We left the facility and on the way home, approximately 45 after she received the vaccine, she began slurring her words ands was confused. The slurring lasted for 2-3 minutes The confusion continued. I brought her the ER where she was immediately taken in for  a CT Scan. She later had an MRI, and met with a Cardiologist. She later had an EEG at the request of a Neurologist. She spent three nights in the hospital.  All tests showed no acute signs of stroke, etc.

                                                I had the vaccine at 1:00 PM, and that same night I attended the wake of a family member, and I wasn&#39;t feeling well and I was feeling itchy and burning. That night I didn&#39;t sleep at all. So that night I called the doctor and I went to the doctor Friday morning, and was diagnosed with the worst case of Shingles she had ever seen. She prescribed prednisone on a taper, Valtrex (generic) 1 gram tablet 3x daily for one week, and topical ointment (flutisone propionate) .005 strength twice daily, and 500 mg tylenol every six hours.

The pain started around 2/19/21 and has improved but still present. On 2/28/21 patient noticed a red rash about the size of a half dollar at the injection site. She had not looked at site prior and is unsure if rash was present earlier. Patient asked me to report to VAERS as she does not have internet access and would prefer not to make the phone call herself.

The site (on my lower backside) tingles and warns me of what is coming. This was different. No warning. Two bumps (or lumps) were there where they always appear. I haven&#39;t had an outbreak for at least 6 months. My feeling is that is came on from the vaccine, though I have no proof other than it came after the shot. It may have come on earlier than 7 a.m., but I wasn&#39;t aware of it until I woke up. I usually take valacyclovir 500 mg when it starts but I am going to wait a few days as I don&#39;t want it to interfere with the vaccine. However I will check with my doctor to get his advice.

Staff cannot answer what caused the seizure though they found a 4mm bleed on her brain; believed unrelated to seizure; on an MRI.  My mother has never had a seizure and noone in my family have had seizures.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the vaccine but felt it should be reported to you.

I visited the doctor advised warm compresses and the problem subsided in a few days. After the second dose I woke up in the middle of the night with the chills and chattering teeth. It was uncontrollable shaking. My temperature of 102 degrees in the morning. I had shooting pains in my arms and legs. Felt terrible all day. Took Tylenol no effect. Advil worked better.  The lymph nodes were sore under my arm. On the third day I felt a little better but on the fourth day I felt a little better.

I woke at 2:00am the following morning to go to the restroom and my dog needed to go out.  I felt light headed as soon as she was back in the house.  I felt things going dark and I passed out in the hallway.  I don&#39;t know how long I was out but when I came to, I felt like I couldn&#39;t move.  I laid there for a while and finally crawled back to my bed.  I was able to get back in bed.  By then it was 3:00am.  The next night I woke in the night and had an irregular heartbeat.  I could not get back to sleep until it finally went away.  For several days after the vaccination, I had very little energy.

Ten days after, I woke up to swelling redness and hives covering my upper left arm to the elbow. Waited 24 hours to see if it would disappear and when it didn&#39;t, I then went to the doctors office. I was seen by the nurse/practitioner who gave me a steroid shot  and advised me not to continue with the vaccine program. Everything healed up in a couple of days and I continued with the vaccine program , receiving my second dose on January 28th. with no reaction.

The husband was offered an office visit for evaluation of symptoms, but he declined stating that she seemed to be coming around on Saturday 3-6-21.  The husband was advised that pt. could take Tylenol for fever.  Husband was advised that if symptoms worsened over the weekend that she should be evaluated by the nearest ER.

                                                Beginning about 4 hours after receiving shot, muscle aches in arm, from elbow radiating up the arm, over the shoulder thru collarbone &amp; up the side of the neck to the ear.  By 6 hours after the shot, pain was excruciating and I was in literal Agony for the next 8 hours. It felt like a hot poker was being pushed along that pathway.   Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen had no effect.  I could not sleep &amp; could barely move the arm  at all.  (I am Not a pain Wimp)  I would say this was the longest lasting without relief/strongest pain I have ever experienced and I have had one child;&#43; hip &amp; shoulder surgery which required almost no after surgery medication at all.  By 5 a.m. I was able to sleep a bit &amp; most of the extreme pain was gone by 8 a.m.  I had some headache the following day and was barely able to function (I live alone) just from all over tiredness.  About 36 hours after injection, I was back to normal.

Afterwards, for days, I was weak and now three days later still have some nausea although I am not throwing up.  I do have loose bowels though.

I thought nothing of it and got my 2nd shot,on 2/5/2021,but the pain increased every day and I finally called my rheumatologist, who ordered CRP and sed rate.  The lab tests were elevated and he told me to increase the prednisone to 10 mg, which did very little.  The pain now was also in my shoulders and neck.  I eventually went to 20 mg of prednisone, but that still does not relieve all the pain.  I use excedrin during the night to help tide me over.  I will be seeing my rheumatologist in April for follow up, but the pain is worse than it was when it started.

                                                A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 80-year-old, female patient who suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia).                                                                                                                      The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided/unknown by the reporter.    On 01-FEB-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 007M20A)  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 01-MAR-2021, the patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Batch number: 023M20A) in her left (dominant) arm.   On 02-MAR-2021, she experienced a side effect which was not listed in the sheet she was given. She wanted to call and report the side effect. She said that she was at the stove cooking and suddenly felt very weak and felt that her vision started to flip. She called for her husband to come over who seated her on a chair. After that she says she doesn&#39;t remember what happened, but her husband told her that her whole body was shaking, her head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds. When she came back, she could hear a rushing sound coming out of her left ear. She was also drenched in perspiration. She felt very nauseated and cold the whole afternoon.  On 03-MAR-2021 she felt better. She had a low grade fever of 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events, suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia) was considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.   The out come of the event, head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I had all symptoms ofcovid except arm pain and diarreha  fever.   I had Extreme fatigue, nausea, headache, balance was off, muscle and nerve and back pain.  Just took covid test and just got results--Negative. (3-19-21)  The symptoms subsided March 12.  Still vaguely experiencing all of them.   Should I take the 2nd shot.  Feel those results would return at an even heightend level.  Pharmacist said I was probably 85 % covered now with these effects from the 1st shot and should not take the 2nd.  My Dr.  said the 2nd shot was my call to make and that I should report it to CDC.

                                                Unable to speak; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning an eighty-year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced the event unable to speak (aphasia).  The patient&#39;s ongoing medical conditions included congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diverticulitis, asthma, osteoarthritis, allergy to prednisone and allergy to tape.

An MRI done on 09-Feb-2021 showed multiple areas of acute ischemia in a left MCA distribution and no hemorrhagic transformation.  Lab work performed yielded no significant findings. The reported stated the patient may be transferred to a higher level of care.  No further treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was unknown.   The outcome of the event, unable to speak, was not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.

I was going to go sit down, but I passed out and fell onto the kitchen floor for a few  seconds.   I have never passed out before or felt such light-headedness.  I went to lay down.   I vomited a bit of liquid.  I lay down and several hours later my husband drove me to the emergency room.  After many tests they said I had suffered a Syncope and had a slight concussion.

Then, about 5 weeks, developed headaches, ear aches and achiness in neck and lower skull.  Then about 6 weeks later (3/29/21) got dizzy and felt no energy, still had headaches, slight ear aches and achiness in neck and lower skull.  Lasted about 3 days but seems to be better (took Meclazine starting on 3/30.    This all concerned me until I saw my chiropractor today (3/31) and he told me 2 of his patients had dizziness too.  They took Benedryl and that helped immensely.  They told him that they looked it up and dizziness can be a an adverse reaction to the Covid vaccs.  I looked it up on FB and saw that dizziness can be a reaction although the timeline for it to happen varied greatly - from immediately after to 3 weeks after.  In my case it&#39;s about 6 weeks after.  Felt ok in between the vacc #2 and first reaction of sore arm.  5 weeks after til next reaction of achy neck, skull and earaches.  6 weeks after Vacc # 2  til dizziness.

                                                She got her vaccine, and started with her arm hurting that evening.  The next morning it was itching, and then blotchy.  She then started scratching her arms, shoulders, back, chest, and there were little clusters of measles like areas.  She scratched on her wrist that had fluid  in it.  She had them in both of her eyes, and has been horrid, and they jump all over and now she has clusters of scabs that are itching as well.  She went to the doctor and they gave her steroids which did not help much, but was given Benadryl also which has helped some.  She also saw her cardiologist who told her she could take up to 4 Benadryl a day.   She was fine last night, and this morning she had the itching and scratching again in the same areas as before.  No fevers and no other reactions other than the itching rash.  She also had swelling of the palms of her hands and itching, which is the reaction she gets when she gets anaphylaxis.  She said that they are all over her back, all over her chest.  She said that yesterday it seemed to be calming down.    She was told not to get her vaccine on the 20th, but to wait until things settled down a bit.

                                                Pt noticed 3 days later that there was a giant swollen welt spanning the entire upper arm area almost down to the elbow. It was blue and purple in color and lasted more than 10 days. It was very painful and pain was constant the entire &gt;10 day period. She did not take any pain medication for it. Did not start getting better until after at least 10 days, and even then it took a long time to go away. She mentioned a similar thing happens with her pneumonia vaccine, only that was a much bigger much more painful welt. However flu vaccine does not do that so it is not exclusively an injection site reaction. So it is unique just to pneumonia shot and covid shot. Pt stayed 30 minutes after 2nd dose. Arms looked fine when she left.

No official diagnosis, treat as  ITP.   Follow up visits with oncologist/haematologist to keep an eye on platelets as they increase.   March 30-Apr 4 - ER visit due to swelling of ankles, feet, and left arm. Tests show superficial blood clot, fluid on lungs, and pneumonia. Oncologist said that &#34;we have no official diagnosis&#34;, that she&#39;s being treated for ITP.   April 6-14 - follow up visit to oncologist/haematologist show elevated kidney enzymes, then later liver enzymes,  low sodium.   April 14 - decision to move to short term rehab for regular PT and OT. Continued swelling (fluid in third spaces.)   April 21 - visit to cardiologist to perform cardioversion, successful (during first week of hospital stay, heart rhythm med had to stop).   April 23 - facility nurse discovered significantly low Hemoglobin and a blood transfusion was ordered.    April 24 - returned to short term rehab facility.   April 25 - discovered my mother on O2 and state of health was different,  extremely weak and not moving, arm hurting badly. I insisted that her oncologist is contacted. Transported to ER. Discovered her blood work abnormal. After stabilizing her, rushed to the hospital ICU.   April 26 -  Discussed with her ICU doctor the history of what you have read above. He explained that the covid-19 vaccination has a tendency to affect three proteins specifically that clot and thin blood. I begged him to &#34;get it out of her system.&#34; Her bleeding was significant and platelets dropped, again. Still has her mental facilities. Responding well to aggressive treatment: albumin transfusion,  plateletpheresis, and CRRT. Pleural catheter to remove fluid from the lungs. Mention of Sepsis.   April 27 - Lifted her head up today, opened her eyes, making doctors very happy.  Her cardiologist and the ICU doctor both said they were &#34;confused&#34; and everything happening to my mom was &#34;a mystery.&#34; Though going in to the evening, her nurse expressed to me that she&#39;s worried. The ICU oncologist called me at home in the evening.  He asked me if she had been having a fever on a regular basis. He said he thought it could be TTP or a rare disease called HTH, but both results wouldn&#39;t be back for one week. He planned to consult with a doctor.  He explained to me that the blood was attacking itself and &#34;confused,&#34;  and that her organs were shutting down. He indicated that the blood work wasn&#39;t indicating significant infection. He referenced how the vaccination has made her auto immune system &#34;go crazy.&#34;   April 28 -  I get a call very early from the nurse that she has been fighting with my mother&#39;s blood pressure all night, trying to keep it elevated. She told me to come to the hospital, because she had taken a turn for the worse. I arrive to find my mother&#39;s eyes wide open, breathing shallow, and blood pressure steady, but drops without assistance from medication. She continues to have her mental facilities. She passed away, organs shutting down, and blood pressure dropped.

                                                She got her 2nd vaccine, they kept her 30 minutes as she had problems with the 1st one, her BP was okay and that she could drive home and was told to drink a lot of water.  She went home and after every bottle of water she had 3-4 episodes of diarrhea and kept drinking water all day and after 3-4 she did not have any more diarrhea.   She had some pain in her arm.   She started having visions of chicken scratches/white lines across her eyebrows from the left to the right across her whole forehead.    She always has this vision discrepancy all day long inside the house and outside when she goes and gets the mail.  She first went to the eye doctor as she was having floaters, white lines visually appearing but have not had them for a long time, and these did not go away and they were not the usual floaters like she had before.  They got her in the office immediately and that doctor said that he did not have an answer for her and he didn&#39;t find anything wrong with her eyes.   She told him that she was worried about what happened after the vaccine.    She went to her PCP and she ended up in the hospital as she has a problem with her left rotator cuff and needs surgery on that but is waiting for her leg to heal from total knee surgery.   When she lays down at night she has chest pains, and didn&#39;t know what it was and was told that there is a nerve that runs down from the shoulder and crosses over to the heart and gives the feeling of chest pains.  She had tests done and they did not give her any answers to what the pains were.   She then went to her PCP again and told her about the vision issues and she didn&#39;t have an answer to her issues either.  Her daughter suggested that perhaps her BP was an issue and she brought that to her attention and she told her to document it and to FU this week with her nurse to see that everything was working okay.  She states that her BP has never been the same, she has never had a BP problem before.  She takes it every morning between 9-10 AM.  131/86, 139/80, at 5:00 132/74, 148/88, 133/84, 139/92, yesterday was 137/83, today 132/84.   She has been placed on BP medicine, Cardizem 30 mg.

Within a few days the funny feeling went to all my fingers,  the left hand first and then the right.  I then noticed that my fingers were very sensitive to hot and cold.  that feeling has not left.  It is better some days than others.  I have to wear gloves to get in the freezer..,,.I never have had sensitive fingers before.  My doctor suggested that it might be a side effect from the Moderna vacine.

My words would not come out. It happened for 30 minutes and I walked around the yard for a while then I was okay. I was really frightened. When I told my doctor what happened, he advised me he did not feel it was related to the vaccine. He advised me to start taking Baby Aspirin. The doctor did not tell me I had a mild stroke but, I feel that I did.

Pain not changed by Tylenol.  Ordered Paraffin and used  baths on hands with only temporary relief. Symptoms seemed to constantly change over following days and weeks. Individual joints in hands would be inflamed and tender to touch. This varied from day to day as to which joint was inflamed. Shooting pains in lower arms and hands in April and May,. Sometimes extended to all joints. Pain when interlacing fingers. Pains shooting through fingers when just sitting.  Sensations of pin pricks  or bugs crawling on my skin when nothing touching me.

                                                On the first day, my arm was sore and I was a little tired. I had some abdominal pains on the day after the vaccine with diarrhea. After 24 hours of that pain, I could get up and move around. About a week I felt better.

                                                My shot was Saturday at 2 PM.    Monday night I developed a VERY tender, sore achilles tendon.  I could barely walk Tuesday.  I kept working it up and down and I do not excercise,   so it&#39;s certainly NOT from overuse.   I have never had this problem before   I can remember at one time taking some meds that the warnings said they could cause problems with tendons. . so , I&#39;m wondering if this could be because of my shot on Monday.   Hence, the report.

                                                The patient developed left wrist swelling, pain, warmth one week after getting the Moderna COVID vaccine. It is in the same arm in which she got the vaccine. She tried tylenol but it didn&#39;t help. I applied Voltaren gel to the wrist and that helped the pain. I advised if it worsens for her to return. She will monitor the wrist for signs of infection however at this time we will treat for arthritis flare.

On Jan 18, 2021, developed a circular rash, approx 3? long and1 and 1/2? wide in vicinity of the vaccination.  Rosy colored, warm with a hard spot in the middle.  Painful at first, then itchy.  Rash began fading slightly next day, Jan 19, and became itchy but not painful.  Lasted several days, continuing to fade and become less itchy.   By Jan 23, just very mild pink discoloration and very mildly sensitive to the touch.  Then disappeared all together.  The entire episode resembled something like a bee bite.

I received the 2nd shot 1/28/2021 - and I did not have any reactions with that dose.

                                                On Sunday, Feb. 14, I awoke to find my left arm paralyzed. I was unable to move  my fingers or thumb. Could not hold anything. Towards the end of the day, I got feeling back in my thumb, first and middle fingers. the outside of my hand, the ring finger and little finger were still numb and I had no control over them. Could not keep them straight. Since Monday was a holiday, the clinic was closed so I sent an email to Dr. explaining the situation. He told me to report to the CDC and that he would refer me to a neurologist. My two fingers and the outside of my hand are still numb. I have seen Dr. and have been referred to a hand therapist.

                                                I had my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Feb. 10, 2021. I had about three days of chills, aches, headache, very sore arm. etc. On Feb. 22,2021 a red area  about 3 or 4 inches around the site of the injection was noticed. It was itchy and uncomfortable. I spoke to my internist and allergist. There is some disagreement about whether I should take the second dose.  I have taken benadryl and tylenol. Both doctors said it was unusual for such a reaction 2 days after receiving the vaccine. What information do you have about rashes occurring so long after the vaccination? What is the recommendation about the second vaccine? Thank you.

Dr there glanced at my arm and said it was an infection  and gave me antibiotic, Cephalexin 500mg, 10 days.  Feel really bad but maybe better today and that  is after tramadol and tylenol. Headaches. Tylenol helps.. now afraid to take 2nd shot.

                                                arm redness, pain and swelling had subsided after injection by 2/10 but then on 2/12 it flared up again and was much worse than before, did not go away for a week. Very swollen, and extremely itchy.  I can still see a slight circular mark on the left arm. I had the second dose in my right arm on 3/5 which is still itchy and sensitive.

Severe diarrhea all over floor and self.   Was not found until Saturday afternoon, and was transported to the ER by ambulance.  Remained in hospital Saturday evening until Monday afternoon.  As of today, the following Friday the 12th, she is still weak and unsteady at times, where she was previously ambulating fine with adequate energy.  Still feels like she has no strength.

She did not have any symptoms but acknowledged feeling anxious about the side effects prior to arrival for vaccine. After the 2nd dose, she experienced chest pain, jaw pain, body numbness and tingling, and nausea. She did not have vomiting, shortness of breath, syncope, or headache. She was hypertensive on the cardiac monitor and EKG with T wave inversion in lead III, otherwise unremarkable. Heart rate stable, alert and oriented, cardiopulmonary exam benign. She was sent to the ER for further workup, but did not seem to have any allergic reaction to the vaccine. It is unknown what occurred at ER, as she either went to a separate health system or did not go at all.

When we were going home they told me I was swerving, all over the road and they told me to stop, they would drive, I said no, i don&#39;t trust anyone with my car. We got home, I remember changing into my nightgown and was texting someone and I suddenly I stopped. After that I was unresponsive. I would not answer anyone, they said I looked pale and stared into the air. They called my children and they came and emergency personnel was called. I was taken to a hospital and they transferred me to another hospital. I stayed there for 3-4 days. After going home it took me some days to be able to walk without assistance. I wanted to say I had covid in May (1st time) and September (2nd time) . I still do not have taste or smell back from the covid. I can only eat 3 or 4 bites and then I am done.

During her waiting time, she started to experience pain going down her right arm and the arm turned colder than usual.  This is when her caregiver alerted our staff and was attended to by Dr.    APRN also came to monitor her.  I also started talking with her and monitored her during this time.  We asked her to wait for an additional 30 minutes.  I let her know I would follow up with her this afternoon as well.  We let her know that if she has any other allergic reactions or had any problems with breathing, facial swelling, etc then she should contact 911 or enable her medical emergency alert device.  She acknowledged.

She denies a history of heart palpitations.  She has no history of hypercoagulable state.  She has no history of blood clots or easy bleeding.  She has no history of infection and denies fevers chills or night sweats.  She has no significant history of peripheral vascular disease and can walk over a mile without difficulty.  She denies symptoms of transient ischemic attacks.

Took Tylenol and seemed to be improving, but pain started getting worse a few days later and had muscle spasms occasionally.   Dr suggested  using Motrin instead of Tylenol during the day and 1/2 10 mg Baclofen tablet nightly.   Appears to be getting better at the moment, but that happened earlier before I went to the DR.

                                                She got her vaccine, the arm was a little sore.  Then about 30 minutes had sinus problems, but then for 2 days she had fever and chills.  Then the ringing in her ears started within a week after that.  She does have tinnitus but it intensified since the vaccine.  She had a teleconference call with her doctor who told her that it was not one of the symptoms of the vaccine and told her to have her hearing checked.

                                                Pt called and stated she received her vaccine on 05/18/2021, started having arm and neck pain, nausea, lightheadedness, stomach cramping, on 05/19/2021 in the afternoon. She sat up to get some saltine crackers to help her feel better, and she started to get dizzy. She then remembers trying to hold herself up, and then the next thing she recalls is laying on her back on her kitchen floor. It was then she felt dizzy again and then sat herself up enough so she could vomit 3 times. She also reported having profuse sweating and dry heaves. Her husband found her about 30 minutes later when he returned home from picking up lunch for them. She refused to go in the hospital to get checked out until she called her PCP on 05/21/2021 because she still was not feeling well. They recommended that she go into the ER. She had a CT scan, UA, troponin levels checked, and other blood work. Was treated with IV lactated ringers in the ER, and given meclizine for the dizziness. UA showed positive E. coli, indicative of a UTI. Pt chose to be discharged home instead of staying overnight because she stated she would get plenty of rest at home. Spoke with pt 05/25/2021 after she had called to let us know what happened. Pt has scheduled additional CT scan on 06/08/2021 and follow-up with a neurologist 06/10/2021.

                                                peripheral neuropathy, could not walk, feet hurt a lot; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of NEUROPATHY PERIPHERAL (peripheral neuropathy, could not walk, feet hurt a lot) in an 81-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 039B21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concomitant products included GABAPENTIN for an unknown indication.    On 27-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 30-Apr-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced NEUROPATHY PERIPHERAL (peripheral neuropathy, could not walk, feet hurt a lot) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was treated with IBUPROFEN ongoing since an unknown date at a dose of 1 dosage form and GABAPENTIN ongoing since an unknown date at a dose of 300 mg three times a day. At the time of the report, NEUROPATHY PERIPHERAL (peripheral neuropathy, could not walk, feet hurt a lot) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.       The patient said that she still cannot walk as much as she used to and is still having some troubles. Patient&#39;s neurologist recommended for her to increase her Gabapentin 300mg from 2 tablets to 3 tablets.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.

                                                I began feeling dizzy, nauseous, weak in legs, blurred vision in early May which continued throughout the month.  On June 3 I experienced an event like no other.  My legs felt like rubber and  tried but could not speak.  My husband carried me to the sofa, when I sat down I felt disoriented, and saw a circle in front of my eyes.  I felt as if I was about to pass out.  I saw my cardiologist a week later.  He is concerned that the neurological symptoms are new.  He suspects I had a mini stroke despite being on blood thinner for my CHF and referred me to a neurologist.  He suggested I report this sudden change to VAERS.

                                                pt says she developed a rash and has progressively gotten worse since then.  The rash is red, with little pea shaped pimples that are burning and spreading all over her body.  The skin is prickly and very sensitive.  She still cannot think clearly and still has fatigue.  Her legs are bothering her know as well.  She saw PCP Dr on 2/19/21 and told to take Claritin which did not help.  On 2/26/21 she saw Dermatologist PA.  She was given a skin biopsy.  She was diagnosed w/ spongiotic and interfaced dermatitis w/ rare eosinophils.  She was prescribed triamcinolone.  She has since developed nose bleeds that would come every couple of days then started happening daily.  She has had blood test which white blood count cells were up, the doctor thinks the steroid cream may have caused this so she is no longer using it.   She has been to the doctors several times due to the skin rash and nose bleeds and nothing the doctors have done for her has helped with her symptoms thus far. She goes back to the doctors in a couple of weeks for another biopsy.  These has had these symptoms for months.

                                                On the second day I was shivering and freezing. Despite testing my temperature, it never registered as a fever. I went to the doctor and was given a prescription for doxycycline. It did not make any difference. I went back a second time because I was concerned that the redness and swelling was not going away. I was not experiencing any pain. Somewhere along the line I had developed hives on my head and face. I as put on doxycycline again and a strep test was done. The strep tests was negative. After a few days I went to an allergist. The allergist said she did not see anything indicating I needed a food allergy test. They also tested me for a penicillin allergy which came back negative. The allergist sent me to an ENT. No one was able to determine a cause. I went back to my PCP.  He put me on singular and Allegra. He also drew blood to be tested for food allergies so I am awaiting the results of that.

She briefly waited around the pharmacy afterwards then began wandering to the back of the store. Roughly 30 minutes after administering the vaccine, she came back to the pharmacy and vomited. Pharmacy staff checked on her and she stated she felt weak, nauseaus, and sick. She stated she just needed a moment to recover and did not need EMS, but the feeling did not pass, so a code white was called and EMS were called to check out the patient. They checked vitals and spoke with the patient, but she did not want to go to the hospital at that time, so she was allowed to rest in the immunization booth until she felt comfortable driving herself home. However, the feeling still did not pass, so roughly 45 minutes later she requested EMS be called again, and she was taken to the hospital.

                                                On 4/7/21, she received the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Then, around 5/1/21, she developed fevers to 102 with associated fatigue and poor appetite, but no other clear localizing symptoms, including no sore throat, cough, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, N/V/D, joint swelling/pain, rashes, or dysuria. She presented to an outside hospital ED where she had an infectious workup that included a CXR concerning for LLL pneumonia. She was prescribed doxycycline for 7 days with resolution of her fevers and subjective improvement.    In early June 2021,  the patient redeveloped fevers and chills, worst at nighttime, without localizing symptoms. Her appetite and energy level remained very poor despite several changes to antidepressants as an outpatient. She was treated with nitrofurantoin x 5 days for presumed UTI, but fevers persisted, still without associated cough, CP, or SOB. With going fevers, fatigue, and poor appetite resulting in ~18lb unintentional weight loss, she was admitted to Hospital on 6/22/21 for further evaluation.  While at Hospital, she continued to have fevers to 102&#43; without localizing symptoms despite empiric doxycycline. A broad infectious workup returned negative. CT chest and CTAP were also unrevealing for a cause of fevers. She was found to have an elevated ferritin, LDH, and triglycerides, as well as a low fibrinogen, concerning for HLH (high H-score). She received high-dose dexamethasone. Bone marrow biopsy was performed that was negative for malignancy. However, peripheral flow cytometry returned with a clonal B-cell population, her soluble IL-2 was elevated, and she was found to have splenic enhancement on PET-CT, all concerning for occult lymphoma as the potential driver of her HLH. She remains admitted and is critically ill with complications of DIC and bleeding that preclude a splenic biopsy to confirm the suspected diagnosis of lymphoma. Since her fevers, malaise, and fatigue started less than 1 month after her second dose of the Moderna vaccine, and the patient was insistent that she &#34;hadn&#39;t felt right&#34; since she received that second dose of the vaccine, we decided to report this event in the VAERS system.

She presented to the ED with these symptoms and fatigue. She was diagnosed with COVID pneumonia and dehydration and admitted to the COVID Unit.   Problem list: -Severe Covid pneumonia with pulmonary infiltrates and new hypoxia. Symptom onset 7/11/2021 -Hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to above -mildly elevated troponin w/o chest pain -Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, suspected to be secondary to coronavirus -Acute kidney insufficiency, suspect prerenal azotemia from volume depletion -History of hypertension, currently hypotensive -Weakness -new dx of DMII with steroid induced hyperglycemia     Plan: -Continue inpatient level of care in the Covid unit -Dexamethasone (7/18/2021-) and completed remdesivir (7/17/2021-7/21), supplementary oxygen, Mucinex, albuterol, proning, is at the spirometry. CRP elevated at 19, D-dimer elevated at 1200 will trend CRP but currently not severely hypoxic enough to qualify for Tocilizumab. Troponin downtrended. TTE with right sided heart dyfxn, likely at least partially chronic as CTA does not show any evidence of pulmonary embolus. Would recommend repeat transthoracic echocardiogram after recovery from acute illness and consideration of right heart catheterization if right ventricle dysfunction appears to be persistent. -Sliding scale of insulin started given her history of borderline diabetes with the expectation of hyperglycemia on dexamethasone. 7.5.

She had never been treated with terminal complement inhibition.). Concurrent medical conditions included Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (long-standing history of steroid-responsive granulocyte clone size, 98%).   On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HAEMOGLOBINURIA (admitted for further management of a PNH flare) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (heme pigment-associated acute kidney injury) (seriousness criteria hospitalization), HAEMOLYSIS (severe hemolysis) (seriousness criteria hospitalization), CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Condition aggravated) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), INFLUENZA LIKE ILLNESS (Approximately 8 hours after receiving dose 2 she developed Flu-like symptoms), CHROMATURIA (One day after dose 2, she developed dark urine), ASTHENIA (One day after dose 2, she developed generalized weakness), ABDOMINAL PAIN (One day after dose 2, she developed abdominal pain) and ODYNOPHAGIA (One day after dose 2, she developed odynophagia). The patient was treated with METHYLPREDNISOLONE for Adverse event, at a dose of 1 gram; ECULIZUMAB (intravenous) for Adverse event, at a dose of 600 milligram and RAVULIZUMAB for Adverse event, at an unspecified dose and frequency.  At the time of the report, PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HAEMOGLOBINURIA (admitted for further management of a PNH flare), ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (heme pigment-associated acute kidney injury), HAEMOLYSIS (severe hemolysis),  CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Condition aggravated), INFLUENZA LIKE ILLNESS (Approximately 8 hours after receiving dose 2 she developed Flu-like symptoms), CHROMATURIA (One day after dose 2, she developed dark urine), ASTHENIA (One day after dose 2, she developed generalized weakness), ABDOMINAL PAIN (One day after dose 2, she developed abdominal pain) and ODYNOPHAGIA (One day after dose 2, she developed odynophagia) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In 2021, Antibody test: negative (Negative) Negative. In 2021, Blood bilirubin: 1.8 mg/dl (Inconclusive) 1.8. In 2021, Blood creatinine: 0.91 mg/dl (Inconclusive) 0.91 and 1.69 mg/dl (Inconclusive) heme pigmentassociated acute kidney injury (baseline: 0.79 mg/dL). In 2021, Blood lactate dehydrogenase: 1272 (Inconclusive) 1272 U/L and 3282 (High) On day 2 after admission to the emergency department. In 2021, Haematocrit: 30 percent (Inconclusive) 30. In 2021, Haemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL (Inconclusive) 10.0. In 2021, Laboratory test: demonstrated severe hemolysis (abnormal) demonstrated severe hemolysis. In 2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) after admission to the emergency department.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HAEMOGLOBINURIA (admitted for further management of a PNH flare), CONDITION AGGRAVATED (Condition aggravated), INFLUENZA LIKE ILLNESS (Approximately 8 hours after receiving dose 2 she developed Flu-like symptoms), CHROMATURIA (One day after dose 2, she developed dark urine), ASTHENIA (One day after dose 2, she developed generalized weakness), ABDOMINAL PAIN (One day after dose 2, she developed abdominal pain) and ODYNOPHAGIA (One day after dose 2, she developed odynophagia) to be possibly related.    Concomitant medications were not provided.  The patient received a transfusion of 2 U red blood cells (RBCs) as a treatment and received a transfusion of 1 additional unit of RBCs after admission to the emergency unit. On day 2, the patient received a transfusion of 1 additional unit of RBCs to suppress erythropoiesis. The patient received meningococcal prophylaxis with meningococcal B and ACWY vaccines without complications and was discharged on day 6 and continued on terminal complement inhibition with ravulizumab in the outpatient setting.

EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

                                                Called at 8 am this morning to inform me of a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She received the vaccine on Tuesday, 1/19/21. The next day she noted the back of her tongue on the R side was swollen. On Thurs, 1/21/21, she reports she woke up with the back of her tongue swollen on both sides such that she had some trouble speaking and needed to be very careful with chewing so she would not bite her tongue. She stated she also had drippy sinuses and an earache which then woke her up several times during the night last night. Today she reports the tongue swelling is only to the back R side of her tongue. She continues to have ear pain. She states she had not reported the symptoms to anyone before her call because she had not felt the symptoms were life-threatening. I asked her if she had taken any benedryl, and she stated the only medication she had taken was her analgesic herbal supplement. She states she has never had a vaccination reaction in the past. I advised her to call her PCP and be seen, which she was able to do. After she was seen, she called and stated while the clinician was looking at her tongue, it started to have shooting pains when she moved it to the right. The clinician stated her tongue and throat were not visibly swollen, noted no swollen lymph nodes, and noted no ear abnormalities.

That lasted about 3 hours when it slowed down and finally stopped. I slept. in the morning I awoke, with a terrible headache and was completely exhausted. I slept all day. (taking Advil and Tylenol for the headache. Nothing helped. I finally took an Imitrex, when I went to bed again. During the day, when I woke I had about a bottle of water during the entire day and all night . Didn&#39;t feel like eating anything. Today I was still tired and the headache was back, but not as bad. I had breakfast and supper and slept in between. Tonight I feel much better.

                                                I video chatted with her Thursday after receiving the vaccine. My mom was in poor health but she was talking in complete sentences and responded appropriately. She was upright in bed and made eye contact. She smiled and denied pain. By Sunday, she was extremely weak and unable to sip water with a straw. Her health had changed dramatically and rapidly. She moaned in pain and was very fatigued. Her condition continued to deteriorate over the week and she stopped talking and was constantly sleeping. They started antibiotics for the oozing cancer lesion and then morphine for pain and end of life care. She passed away on January 22nd which was 15 days post vaccination.

Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine I had racing heartbeat for 2 hours. I was short of breath over the next few days. I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

It is hard to describe.  I did not think I could drive home safely, so I sat back down and told the girl. She let me sit quietly and than took my blood pressure which was either 185 or 189.  She let me rest and then took it again.  This time it was 167.  I left there about 8:30a.m., came right home and went to bed.  Got up after a long nap and B.P. was 165/82 61 at 6:45p.m. My face is still flushed, have chills and slight headache, took aspirin.  At 9:45 B.P. was 150/92 64, felt the same.

Headache continued for  four days and fever would come and go but usually at night. I did not receive treatment but I did let my cardiologist office know what was going on. When I continued with the headache, I contacted the internist?s office and I only had a TelMed visit with them. My nostrils had something like cold sores but then I started sneezing and realize there was infection also. Had a second TelMed visit with the PA who started me on an anabiotic Amoxicillian. The infection is clearing up in my sinuses but I am coughing a lot. Overall continue to feel very tired and weary

No other symptoms and it is slowly improving.  3/1/2021 my mother called me at 1:38. She speaks very slowly, has a difficult time getting certain words out and definitely has a problem completing thoughts and sentences.  Her speech is somewhat slurred. She seems &#34;out of it.&#34;  Her primary care doctor encouraged her to go to urgent care.  My father is taking her there now. It is currently 3:07 pm.

Slowly was able to slide across the floor to where phone was charging. Called my daughter (15 minutes away). She helped lift me into a chair.  My mind was clear the whole time. She finished making my coffee, I moved to sit on the couch. Began to feel normal, maybe weak, not like dancing but normal. She left. Rested, drank water, felt fine but kept my phone with me.

                                                I notice a different feeling in my arm-it seems to be a itching burning sensation.  After a few minutes I pulled up my sleeve and noticed small red spots forming, It  was splotchy  over a  little over an  inch wide and long.  I watched this and it continued but was more annoying than anything.  Later in afternoon it was spreading to a wider area and was showing a brighter redness.  By 11 p.m. the coloring had spread and my upper arm felt warm to the touch and had swollen some.  I slept fairly well, woke up and it had increased in size .  Wednesday  morning  the redness was bright red and much of the upper arm was affected.  I called Dr. office and saw Dr. not my usual doctor..

She stated it was oval in appearance and covered most of the upper arm.  She noted a lump in her underarm of the left axilla also.  Denied any fever or other symptoms and otherwise felt fine.  On 3/9/21 she noticed a lump in the groin area and noticed that walking was a little more difficult than usual since both of her knees bothered her.  3/12/21Pt went to orthopedic surgeon and had a &#34;cortisone injection&#34; in the right knee.   This afternoon, the patient&#39;s daughter suggested that she go a local Urgent Care because the patient stated that the lump (previously in groin area)  &#34;was moving.&#34;  She waited in there for over one hour and then a nurse came out and told her to go to the ED for evaluation of her left upper arm for the redness and swelling.  She went directly to the ED and is being evaluation and having bloodwork done.  Daughter said if the lab results are normal, her mother will be discharged with an oral antibiotic and benadryl

I had no strength and was unable to get up.  Each time it only lasted a few seconds or minutes.  It was sort of like I fainted but stronger.  I had spent most of the day resting as I had a very bad headache but that was about gone when I had the two spells.  I had also had a small patch of hives (fever and swelling) about the size of my hand at the site of the shot.  That lasted about a week after each shot.   I thought this was something I should report.  Thanks.

She said within 3 days her legs started to go numb and especially her thigh muscles and her veins in her left foot were engorged. She said she went to the ER and they rxed 40mg prednisone for 4 days and her papers from the ER read &#34;allergy.&#34;  When I spoke to her for the second time and advised her she does not qualify for a second moderna vaccine, patient said that when she went to the ER she went for abdominal swelling, leg swelling, leg numbness, and swelling of the left ankle and foot. I confirmed with her that her symptoms have all improved and she said &#34;yes, tremendously.&#34; She said she spoke to her PCP and at least one additional doctor yesterday.

Soreness and itching continued. I applied cortizona ointment and took bendryl inn hopes it would disappear. After weeks of area continuing to grow now about 4 X 6 inches , severe itching, reddness and sore arm with some pin pricking sensations, I decided to see my  physician at facility I received injections.  I was prescribed methylpred tab 4mg, a prednisone med for 5 days. Today I took my first tablet in the morning. I can however let you know if the treatment helped after I am finished with meds.

                                                Headache began around 8:30 PM and went from my temples and forehead to the base of my neck, followed a while later by pain in both arms between my shoulders and elbows.  Knowing sleep would be difficult, I stayed up until 2:00 AM and fell asleep about 3:00 AM.  I awoke at 3:20 AM trembling so badly that I couldn&#39;t hold a thermometer in my mouth.  So, it was time for &#34;chills and fever&#34; and I put sweat pants and a sweat shirt over my flannel Pjs, heavy socks on my feet, and socks on my hands.  My entire body felt ice cold.  Back under the covers, I finally warmed up and slept off and on for almost eight hours.Woke up around noon on Saturday, feverish, feeling nauseous, exhausted, and still feeling the headache and arm pains.  My &#34;normal&#34; temperature runs from 97.1 to 97.6, but ranged from 100.2 to 100.5 for two days after the vaccine.  Slept off and on around the clock on Saturday and Sunday, and by Monday the headache, pain, and fever were gone.  Slight nausea remained as well as the fatigue on Monday.  On Tuesday, my legs felt wobbly, like &#34;sea legs.&#34;  By Wednesday, I was back to normal catching up on email and reading my books, and on Thursday drove out to the county to bring food to my sister and fix her PC.  I understand that seniors do not usually get the side effects as I did, because the immune system declines with age.  Apparently, my immune system is not aware of my birth date.  Can&#39;t help but wonder if taking Co-Q-10, as I&#39;ve done for almost twenty-four years, has anything to do with it.

This has continued for 4 WEEKS and is just beginning to slightly  let up. My immune system has been in the worst flare I have ever experienced  in all the 20 years I have had auto- immune flares--it just cannot seem to down regulate itself and I have crippled up badly as a result.  Every movement hurts--even my chest hurts every time I take a breath!

She was brought to the emergency department.  Head CT did not reveal any acute findings.  Her generalized weakness and restlessness slowly resolved and she felt back to her normal state by the date of discharge on March 30.  She was not noted to have an infectious process.  Coronavirus testing was negative.  Of note patient with a chronic normocytic anemia.  Iron studies were sent and iron and ferritin were within normal limits with a low percent saturation of 11.

On 3/8, she first started to experience shortness of breath, which was attributable to cardiac etiology and diastolic heart failure at the time, but which in retrospect may have been her earliest symptom of new onset myasthenia gravis, which is the AE I am wanting to report. She was hospitalized from 3/8-3/13, and underwent extensive cardiac workup that was negative. She again developed shortness of breath on 3/17/21 and was re-admitted to the hospital on 3/18/21 for diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure exacerbation, received diuresis from 3/18-3/22/21 but then developed new onset diplopia, at which pint I evaluated her in neurological consultation on 3/22. Her brain MRI disclosed an UNrelated incidental  small left cerebellar infract, but her neurological exam showed a new R lateral rectus palsy and new moderate to severe left eyelid ptosis, suspicious for myasthenia gravis. Anti-acetylcholineseterase antibodies--- binding, blocking, and modulating, were all sent off and came back all strongly positive on 3/26-27/21. The patient then called stating she had developed recurrent shortness of breath, new onset dysphagia, and worsening double vision. I urgently re-evaluated her in outpatient follow-up in my office on 4/2/21 and sent her immediately to the hospital to be readmitted, where she remains as of this reporting date and she has been receiving IVIG with improvement in her symptoms. She did NOT have any previous known history of eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, diplopia, or muscle weakness. In retrospect, the patient states that her current symptomatology began around 3/7/21 with the benefit of hindsight. I am reporting this event because it is very unusual for an 82 year old WOMAN to develop new onset of myasthenia gravis, and it is a known autoimmune disease, and a vaccine would be a plausible trigger for its development, or trigger for its first symptomatic manifestation. I was also especially concerned because my fellow neurologist, ALSO had a patient develop myasthenia gravis about 2 weeks or so following their second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. It would be an EXTRAORDINARY coincidence for two instances of new onset myasthenia gravis to occur 2 weeks post- vaccination at essentially the same time in an institution of our size, so we both felt obliged to report both cases ASAP to the VAERS. I was not able to reach the patient in her hospital room today to get additional specifics about where she got the vaccine, its lot number etc., however she is a retired and has indicated her willingness to provide you with any and all additional information you need, and I am also personally very willing to provide any additional information about her eventual outcome.

                                                I was in the kitchen fixing food when I started having pain in my back, it went up into my shoulders. It was an intense pain. I became extremely weak, I started vomiting, my blood pressure was 196/117 BP, and I was sweating. My grandson called 911 and  I was taken to the hospital Cardiologist said heart was fine. I did NOT have a heart attack. He thinks it is due to the vaccine. Advised that I take the second shot.

                                                Within a couple of hours of the first vaccine, after a long walk, my R hip/leg became weak and unreliable to the extent that I was limping and it has continued to be a problem.  I&#39;d had no problem at all with that since recovering from the surgery done in April 2019.  I delayed the second vaccine until 5 weeks, and after some gradual improvement, it did get somewhat better during that fifth week -- though still not normal.  Prior to the first vaccination, I was accustomed to walking 1 to 2 miles almost every day with no difficulty at all.   The initial reaction to the second dose was less than with the first.  (I didn&#39;t walk for two days after that one.)  However, it worsened over the next couple of weeks so that again I could barely walk 1/4 mile without making things worse again.  Now it&#39;s about 3 1/2 weeks since dose #2 and it does seem to be starting to improve, but slowly.  (And I took ibuprofen for 5 days last week, 400 mg 2x/day, which helped.)   The only other reaction I had to either dose was the usual sore arm.  Neither affected the L hip which still has severe arthritis.   I have kept a day-by-day journal with details.

So her husband kept her in bed all day and by Friday morning things didn&#39;t get any better, and he helped her to get to the end of the bed and went into the kitchen to get breakfast and he heard her fall, and she fell off the bed and was semi-consciousness, and was able to get her back into the bed and called the ambulance.   She was taken to the hospital Friday morning and she&#39;s still in there.  She has been diagnosed with hydronephrosis, and they keep going back and forth on her diagnoses.  At first they said that she had a UTI, and then they said she didn&#39;t, and then said that she did.  The son feels that all three of the doctors feel that it was some sort of reaction to the vaccine.  They did give her steroids at one time, and she developed severe tremors when she moved which have subsided.  She also has had fever, in a weakened state due to this condition.  She is still being treated for this still and said that she will be having to go to rehabilitation before going home.

This continued for over 2 weeks and then started having chest pain.  Went to ER and admitted with pericarditis.  2 days later I went into Atrial fib.  The next day I had a cardioversion.  Home the following day.  One week at home not feeling well, I was readmitted with increased chest pain and shortness of breath.  Pulse very low and needed a pacemaker which was inserted Easter Sunday.  Home now and still not feeling well.

Then five days later she had a serious nose bleed like water gushing out of a faucet.  She put her head back to stop the bleeding.  She had 3 on 4/5/2021, then had 1 on 4/8/21, 2 on 4/10/21, 2 on 4/11/21, and then on 4/12/21 they finally lightened up and then on 4/13/21 she was okay and has had none since.  The only that she did was put her neck back, squeeze her nose and then sat up.  It was about an hour between intervals before the bleeding would stop.  She called her ENT and when she called them she left her name and phone, but they have not called back yet.

                                                My mother suffered a massive stroke 40 days after receiving the 2nd dose of the cover 19 vaccine. She fell sick the day after the injection and suffered with brain fog, memory issues, lethargy from that day forward. On day 36 after the 2nd dose she developed a debilitating stomach issue that cause explosive diarrhea that lasted 4 days/nights. This bout with stomach issues left her extremely weak and exhausted. On the 4th night of the diarrhea she got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and couldn&#39;t lift herself off of the commode. It took two hours for her to call for help. Once admitted to the ER the stroke was confirmed. Because they could not pinpoint the first stroke symptom she was not eligible for the life saving blood thinning meds and suffered complete paralysis of her right side.

                                                4/29 morning after the moderna Covid 2nd injection my dad called me to say my mom was extremely weak and could not stand. When I arrived she was laying in the floor very nauseous and could not stand on her own. She had crawled to bathroom and then just laid on floor in hallway outside of bathroom. I called 911 to check her vitals as she wasn?t responding much but she was conscious. EMTs got her sitting in a chair and checked BP 190/90 and pulse and pulse ox was 94. She dry vomited once and EMTs got her in her bed and eventually she became a bit more alert as was able to sip water and tea and a few bites of toast. Just in and out falling asleep. As of 2:40 pm on 4/29 just sleeping.

                                                On January 29,2021 at about 9 am I experienced extreme total body weakness as though I was about to faint. I managed to lie down. Concurrent with the extreme weakness I felt intense nausea. The weakness and nausea lasted for approximately 45 minutes to one hour when I had to rush to the toilet for a bowel movement. Within an hour to an hour and one half I was totally asymptomatic. There was no recurrence of the GI symptoms or exteme weakness. At the same time I felt itching at the site of the Covid 19 vaccination. When the GI symptoms and weaknes subdided and I looked at my upper left arm, there was swelling and redness surrounding the vaccination site and around the side of my left arm. The itching, swelling and redness lasted for 24 hours and began to subsdide until it was only faintly recognizable as a light pink discoloration around the original vaccination site. Today, February 6th, 2021 the redness has almost completely faded.

The dizziness left but I was so weak, I was in bed for one more day.  By tues. I felt better, but it took till thurs. to feel normal again.    I&#39;m   wondering if this was a reaction since it took three days to  start.     I did notify my dr.  Dr. to see if he thought it might be covid rather than a reaction, but he opted to wait 24 hours &amp; check back with me for a Covid test.  Since I was feeling better every day, we let it go.   My question is  should I receive the second shot?

Temples hurt, lymph glands were swollen, sore throat. Mostly in upper part of anatomy above collar bone. It made me very weak, I had trouble getting out of rocking chair to answer phone. So I took another Tylenol. I usually only take 1-2 Tylenol a day and that was my second one by the middle of the day. I had to lay down and I live alone so I was nervous and had phone beside me and debated calling 911 which I have never done. I dozed and when I woke up about a couple of hours later it was much better. Still had headache and a little stuffiness but anybody can handle that. Also, I was very nauseated and couldn&#39;t eat but I did drink water.

I offered her to lay on the ground but she just had to silence herself from the commotion in the pharmacy closed her eyes and slowly inhaled and exhaled to calm her thoughts and reaction to the vaccine. Offered her to call 911 but she declined. Her daughter was with her and waited in the vaccine room for about thirty minutes.

                                                Since around the 10th, not quite sure, but around that time, I have been feeling very, very tired and weak and slight headache.  It did not occur to me until about 1/2 hour ago that these feelings could be related to the 2/5 shot.  Not bad enough to go to the doctor,  just not feeling normal.  Blamed it on the lack of sun (SADS).  I have a special light that I just started to use 3 days ago. Therefore, I am now reporting my feelings.

                                                On January 1, 2021,  patient was admitted to Medical Center with COVID. Tested positive on January 2, 2021. Spent 10 days in hospital. Once recovered from pneumonia and fever gone, on January 10, 2021,  she was transferred to Rehabilitation Center for continued treatment.  She spent 16 days there.  She developed UTI and CDIF infections and was on/off oxygen.  She started physical therapy.  She was scheduled to  be released to go home on January 27, 2021.  On January 26, 2021, the day before going home, Rehabilitation Center gave her the Moderna vaccine.  On January 27, the day she went home, she started feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t walk. My dad tried lifting her and they both fell to the ground. My dad called 911 and she was taken to Medical Center, with high fever and possible stroke symptoms (which later was negative).  Two days later,  she had difficulty breathing and was put on a ventilator. She was on a ventilator for about three days. They took it off and she slowly started recovering. The doctors did all kinds of tests (blood clot in lung, heart, etc.) and all was negative.  The only thing they could trace it to was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. After spending  11 days at hospital and treating her for various infections, her heart stopped and she passed away suddenly.

                                                Got the vaccine and was feeling tired, and her arm hurt, an all she wanted to do was lay in bed with her heating pad.  The following day she woke up with a headache, some nausea but nothing came up.  She also had diarrhea and her arm was sore.  She felt weak, and since she had COVID she has had shortness of breath.   She stayed in the bed all day unless she had to as her arm felt like it was made of metal and was extremely tired.  She was moving around upstairs and somewhere around 8:00 PM she went to the bathroom, was sweating profusely and wiping herself with tissue, and apparently turned out the light and apparently passed out as she woke up on the floor in the hallway and could not get up right away.   She could not use the left arm, was able to get herself up with the help of the door to stand on her feet.  She walked into her room and sat on the bed, and did not lay back down and greatful that she did not fall down the steps.  She went back to bed, but in the morning she was terrified and her family heard her talking to the doctor on call who told her to go to the ER.  In the ER they told her that she had syncope, seen by Dr. at Health Care.  She was admitted at 11:11 AM on 2/27/21.  She was given IV, had a CAT scan of her head, told her that it did not reveal any blood.  After several hours they discharged her.  She called her doctor and she has an appointment tomorrow morning.   She is feeling tired, not sleeping well.

She mentioned chest pain and an ambulance was called.  Following her vaccinations she was very confused and had fallen in the kitchen the Thursday (22nd) prior to her heart attack.   They took her to ER noted she was in shock and had very low blood pressure enroute to hospital.  Her pulse was very low.  She was life flighted to the medical center.  It was determined a blood clot had blocked a major artery into the right side of her heart and it was removed and a stent was placed.  She remained at hospital 3 nights and was transferred to nursing home for recovery and therapy where she currently is being assessed for mental issues and is on 4 different heart medications to control blood pressure and prevent future heart attacks.  There is not a family history of heart issues. Pt was very healthy in spite of being 83 years old.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included HYDRALAZINE, TOFACITINIB CITRATE (XELJANZ), SIMVASTATIN, LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID), METOPROLOL and CALCIUM for an unknown indication.   On 19-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 17-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 2 dosage form. On 18-Feb-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced ASTHENIA (Felt extremely weak). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced CHILLS (severe chills) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), HYPERHIDROSIS (sweating) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), HEADACHE (headaches) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and PYREXIA (Fever) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 08-Apr-2021, the patient experienced COGNITIVE DISORDER (Started having cognitive problems) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, CHILLS (severe chills), HYPERHIDROSIS (sweating), HEADACHE (headaches), PYREXIA (Fever), COGNITIVE DISORDER (Started having cognitive problems) and ASTHENIA (Felt extremely weak) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In 2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) negative.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   It was reported that the patient became very ill starting around 01-Apr-2021 and had two emergency room visits and was hospitalized. The tests from her hospital visit came back without a specific diagnosis and the doctors did not feel her hospital admittance or symptoms were due to having received the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The reporter felt a possibility, although not officially diagnosed and strictly in his opinion that the patient might have sudden onset of Alzheimer&#39;s. The patient was treated with antibiotic starting on 03-Apr-2021 and tylenol. Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  No reported past medical history The patient did not have COVID-19  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event of asthenia, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however based on reporter causality and lack of temporal association the events of chills, fever, headache and hyperhidrosis were assessed as unlikely related; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event of asthenia, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however based on reporter causality and lack of temporal association the events of chills, fever, headache and hyperhidrosis were assessed as unlikely related

I was not ill before I had the vaccine.  I only know that after my reaction to the second Moderna Vaccine, I had side effects and never felt well after the vaccine.  My bloodwork done for my Wellness Checkup showed low platelet and as time went by my white count went higher and higher above normal.  Weekly bloodwork and testing of my blood showed that &#34;something&#34; caused my platelets to fight, thus dropping my count to  a low of 21.  What caused the platelets to attack?  We will never know.  Now, with all the study done by my Oncologist, I am beginning to heal.  It all started after my Moderna Vaccine.  Do you think that the vaccine may have caused my health issues?

I know how I functioned before this vaccine, and I know darn well how what a diffcult time I am having now.  I also know who is at fault at pushing the vaccine! Dr. lied about the safety, and that is what I believe and no one can change that. I will never be the same, this will never go away and shame on the drug companies for doing sloppy work.  That&#39;s my true outcome and I stand on  it!!!!!!

                                                When the health department and patients daughter arrived at nursing and rehab facility to administer the 2nd shot in the series, The nurses were told that she had gotten her shot already.  When the nurses from the health department and the daughter questioned the staff as to when the patient had gotten her shot, they stated that they skill nursing gave her a moderna vaccine on May 28th, 18 days after her first shot was given to her. At that time, the nurses immediately called the health department to get information on patient and at that time was advised to leave the facility and not administer the second shot.  I did talk with the Administrator about this situation. Advised her to report to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Systems, and that they also need to Call moderna and let them know that this patient was given her vaccine 18 days after her first shot, and it should of been 28 days, so she got it 10 days early.  also advised them that if she pt. had gotten the shot at the facility, it was not registered in state web site, which they had not reported in the state web site.  Advised them they had to place that within 24 hours which they had not.  Also reported to me was that the patient had the appearance of a stroke reported by the nurses at the health department, when questioned about the one sided droopy face of the patient,  the nurses stated on May 10 th when the first vaccine was given she did not have the droopy appearance.

We administered the vaccine and approximately 2-3 minutes later she was turning red and calling me for help. I asked her what was going on and she said to help her, that she can&#39;t breathe, and that she thinks she is going to die. We administered a dose of Epinephrine and shortly after she said she was feeling better but she was shaky/jittery. EMS was called simultaneously and they arrived shortly after.

In addition, I had wheezing and a feeling of &#34;bubbles&#34; in my chest. My arm was very hot and tender at the injection site.  I slept through the rest of the night but awoke feeling extremely weak and confused. As a result, I spent the day in bed. I had no appetite, as well. The next day, I had coughing bouts off and on and still don&#39;t feel myself.

                                                On Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021, I had my second dose.  About 6 hours after injection, my left arm became sore, just as it did with the initial dose.  However, unlike the first dose, on the next day,  the muscle soreness was accompanied by a  large red rash and swelling  just below the injection site.   Today, the third day, the  muscle soreness is gone, but the rash is still there.   It is tender and warm to the touch, and itches.   I have no fever or other symptoms.

The dizziness and vertigo continue through the day Along with chills and nausea throughout the day. My biggest concern was the dizziness which has never happened before. I took her to the emergency room which resulted in a diagnosis of a fractured and displaced clavicle . The dizziness was the most concerning part and they ruled out any cerebrovascular causes. A meclizine 25 mg was given and also prescribe for her when she was discharged. I am a registered pharmacist and is a healthcare provider I looked into the side effects listed. Vertigo and dizziness is not commonly communicated as a adverse effect. This is so concerning for the elderly patients regarding  potential falls which can lead to fractures and be detrimental to their health.That?s exactly what happened to my mother

The severity of the discomfort was such that I would probably refuse a third injection of this type unless it was a clear life or death decision..

                                                I noticed significant swelling and increased pain at the injection site when I went to bed. (The deltoid area had swollen a bit by the first night after injection, so this was the second night. ) I took  an OTC sleep aid (50 mg diphenhydramine) and drifted off by 1 am. At 3 am I awoke, whether due to my usual   polynocturia or the vaccination reaction I can&#39;t say. My upper body, especially my arms and hands, was violently shaking and I had a blinding headache--and likely a fever, too. After that, I awoke at 4, 5, 7 and 8 am, during which time the shaking and headache subsided. I was very tired and my whole body was sore, so I went back to bed and slept until 10 am. By midafternoon, I was back to normal.

I go over and talk to pt and she states she is getting very dizzy, but states no issues breathing. Pt closes eyes and begins to mutter responses. I lay her down on the floor and have someone call 911 and code white at the store. I raise the patients legs while pt lays flat on the floor, pt begins to be responsive and regains full consciousness. She sits up and begins sipping on a bottle of water. Paramedics show up and evaluate her vitals. Her daughter is called and pt is able to leave with daughter and husband to return home.

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       When patient received the vaccine felt like the solution going under her armpit to the back side, she felt littles tingles there. On 30MAR2021 she went to the cardiologist. They did a check, and all was ok. She was concerned because she has a congestion cardio attack before the vaccine (Feb2021).  Very next day she went to the dermatologist because her doctor recommended. She was diagnosed with shingles (where she thinks the solution went, is there where she had the shingles).

                                                Within a few days, my mother started reporting profound fatigue and shortness of breath while conducting routine household activities. She no longer had to energy for her daily exercise walks and became increasingly lethargic. She died in her sleep while taking an afternoon nap on Thursday, February 4th. I am highly concerned this could be a vaccine related.

The worst has been the increasing tremors in my head and hands.  This is what I am most concerned about. I have a history of tremors, but since the vaccine, there has been a marked increase in the tremors. I did not report this right away because I thought it would go away, but now on the eve of my second shot I am very nervous that it will get even worst.  My physician encourages me to continue and get through the side effects than to get COVID with my underlying lung condition. I want to take the vaccine but am nervous that I am experience so much shakiness even a month after the first shot. Would you advise me to take the second shot? My shot is scheduled for tomorrow, February 17.

                                                My mom had a fever, chills, aches all over, sore arm, and had 2 days of memory loss/crazy behavior.  It was almost as if she had dementia - she repeatedly called myself and my daughter claiming that her phone didn&#39;t work and she needed help. She was trying to tell me a phone number but kept giving me random words instead.  She doesn&#39;t remember talking to any one of us who spoke to her Saturday and Sunday. She was repeatedly asking what a specific button did on her TV remote, and would then ask again a few minutes later the exact same question. This went on for 2 days.

It could also be 012620A Received the vaccine and that night around 10 PM I started having chills and my body started shaking for about  1 1/2 hours.  The next morning, I had a dry mouth and vomiting with mucous  going down the back of my throat, low grade fever of 99.6F  loss of appetite and diarrhea which lasted about 17 hours.  My arm hurt and later it started itching.  A  rash formed around the injection site.  I went to Urgent Care.  They said I got an infection from the needle and gave me an antibiotic and told me to use a heating pad to stop the itch.  i got a blister on my arm which my son used a needle to puncture it and water came out.  Nothing helped so I went to my primary doctor,  Dr.  He said I was highly allergic to the vaccine and gave me a script for Prednisone  which I took for 7 days (start high with pills and then reduce amount     I think 3 of 10 mg )  he advised me not to take the second shot for the vaccine so I cancelled the appointment as the doctor said it would make me sicker.

                                                Within the first 24 hours she showed a look of serious aging, and then the following day extreme pain in the mid and left side back making it difficult to walk or move. Severe pain. The pain seem to shift around like more nerve pain showing in the muscle . Started on the left side but moved around.  This was initially helped with some strong curcummin/boswella (inflammation pain formula at our health food store) and a homeopathic remedy. But the symptoms came back and kept going . She is very active and was unable to do her regular routine. She was sleeping more and in considerable pain. After several days, we tried what another country recommends for reactions to vaccines and it seemed to help her within a very short time. There is still now residual pain but she is better.  We have GREAT concern over what a second dose could do and do not feel that with such a strong reaction the second dose safe. Also a great concern that the same amount of vaccine for a 250 pound person and a 100 pound elder. She is very tiny bones and weighs around 100 pounds are less. Very concerning as no medicine is usually the same for everyone. Also a concern of why just one month from second dose when it takes a known 6 weeks for blood to change. A high chance of severe reaction can happen with such a close proximity and a second dose. We would like to see advise of no second shot or considerable less for small people. CDC person recommended she switch vaccines?  That seems risky and there is no studies of adverse reaction to combining two different vaccines.  She would like to be comfortable moving around in public and is of great health for her age so this reaction was very concerning. If she had such a reaction on FIRST DOSE....wouldnt that be a indication that her body reacted and a second dose not necessary  advisable. Please advise. This is of great concern to all of us who love her and of great concern for the general public who may be at risk for such adverse effects. I put unknown below because she still feels some pain even though it is less.

Concurrent medical conditions included AFib (She takes a blood thinner).   On 22-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 19-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HERPES ZOSTER (it developed into a horrible, very severe case of shingles/still has shingles) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and MALAISE (did not feel very well/was not feeling well). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ILLNESS (Very sick), PAIN (had some of the typical symptoms like achy), ASTHENIA (weak) and VOMITING (just threw up). At the time of the report, HERPES ZOSTER (it developed into a horrible, very severe case of shingles/still has shingles), MALAISE (did not feel very well/was not feeling well), ILLNESS (Very sick), PAIN (had some of the typical symptoms like achy), ASTHENIA (weak) and VOMITING (just threw up) had not resolved.            The patient was taken twice to the emergency room because she developed very severe shingles. The reporter got a message that the patient threw up and patient was taken to the hospital. treatment for the events included antibiotic and pain medication.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                TIA; Left upper lip is turned down/face does not look normal; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (TIA) and FACIAL PARALYSIS (Left upper lip is turned down/face does not look normal) in an 85-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 031M20A and 010M20A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure abnormal.  Concomitant products included METOPROLOL for an unknown indication.   On 30-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form.  On 27-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form.   On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (TIA) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and FACIAL PARALYSIS (Left upper lip is turned down/face does not look normal) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was hospitalized for 3 days due to TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. At the time of the report, TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (TIA) and FACIAL PARALYSIS (Left upper lip is turned down/face does not look normal) outcome was unknown.       For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments  Other concomitant medications included unspecified blood pressure medications.  No treatment information reported.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.   This case was linked to US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-081470 (Patient Link).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist,  the event  of Transient ischemic attack with facial paralysis is confounded by the patient&#39;s history of Blood pressure abnormal and advanced age.

I administered the vaccine and discovered as I was logging the information into Impactsiis that the resident had received the complete series of PFIZER. Her first dose was on 01/11/21 and her second was on 02/01/2021. I administered MODERNA on 04/28/21. I spoke to the administrator to make him aware. I contacted the facility on 4/29 and they said the resident had lack of energy, wouldn&#39;t eat and her blood pressure was running 135/48.  The physician had them monitoring the blood pressure every 30 minutes.

                                                My arm got progressively sore. within the week it migrated to the muscle next to my breast and up my neck. Two weeks later it settled in my shoulder and was very painful. It was akin to bursitis which I have never had in that shoulder but years ago I had bursitis in my other shoulder so I know what it feels like. But, now it has migrated to a sore neck and  causing stiffness when I try to turn my head.  It seems to hurt worse when I lay down and try to sleep than it does when I am sitting or standing. I have not gone to the doctor so I cant answer item 19. Driving is too painful so I probably wont go to the doctor and hoping it will get better. But, I am wondering if I should get my second shot in June or not.

                                                Was wandering around the house in the middle of the night, after midnight. Went to the kitchen to eat and fell, had to have help getting up. She was too weak to get up on her own. Had no recollection of falling. She went back upstairs to her room and eventually continued wandering around. At 7:15 am she didn?t know if it was morning or night. Shortly after eating she had no recollection of eating. All of this sounds like it would be her normal with Alzheimer?s but she is not at this stage yet. She acted as she did when she had a TIA several years ago.

So I got my friend to take to me to the ER and they gave me oxygen, and the next my tongue was still swollen and had blisters on it. They recommended scheduling a follow appointment with PCP.  They gave me a shot and three prednisone pills to take on a taper.

There were probably 3 or 4 of them, in succession. Other than sleeping for 48&#43; hours (except to eat) and a very sore arm vaccine site, and swollen (and still so, but improving), but no other events. No treatment except as given (Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen), no other symptoms, etc.

                                                She had her 2nd COVID-19 vaccine 2 days ago. Yesterday she developed sudden onset of weakness and tiredness. She had a hard time sitting up, trying to lift her arms, had a hard time articulating how she felt and what was wrong, her speech seemed a little slurred, and she felt nauseated. Her daughter denied facial droop and localizing weakness. She continued to be &#34;out of it&#34; and weak until her daughter put her in bed about 7 hours later.

                                                Got the vaccine, and later  noticed pain in her neck, knees, head.  She had dizziness, chills, shakes, nausea and a slight fever.   She went to bed that evening and everything was hurting, and felt very nauseous.  She had a very bad nights rest, but when she woke up her temp was over 100, normal is 97.  She did take her morning meds and an extra-strength Tylenol and went back to bed.   She took Tylenol, was feeling better, but still the chills and fatigue and was better.  The problem with the headache continued and her temp was about 99.   On 2/12/21 had temp over 100 again, no energy, slept a lot.   Had difficulty sleeping that night and had sweats, had temp, nausea and was shaking.  On Monday felt shaky, chills and difficulty sleeping.  On Tuesday she was having headache, not sleeping well and no energy.   She also was not sleeping well, had  a headache.  By 2/17/21 was feeling better, not great as she was still not sleeping well.   She did have covid in April of last year, and was not allowed to see her husband who was in a nursing home until 6/3/20.   When she had the covid test she was inconclusive and that&#39;s why she could not see her doctor.   Her doctor did the antibody test that showed she had antibodies.  She is feeling back to normal as of today, 3/8/21.  She had the malaise from COVID after she got the 1st vaccine.  Feels that they should ask people before getting the vaccine if they had COVID.

Left side of the mouth droops.  Weight loss. Confused. Complained about leg weakness, legs and knees hurt, hard to walk, being tired, drooling, dry mouth, mind not right.

Redness began to fade after 3 weeks; L arm remains swollen and painful.  Pt was evaluated by the MD on 5/18/21 and was advised to hold off on 2nd vaccine (scheduled for 5/25/21)  MD will decide if/when 2nd vaccine will be administered.

                                                Covid-19 vaccine administrations (Moderna) 3/23/21 lot# 013A21A 4/20/21 lot# 013A21A  Admission to Hospital (5/2/21 ? 5/10/21) for hypertension and acute on chronic back pain requiring ICU admission, hyponatremia thought to be due to SIADH. CT of abdomen done at hospital noting no significant lumbar abnormalities and a plain film of her lumbar spine with no obvious compression fracture. Outside hospital notes do not further outline why she could no longer ambulate. Brain MRI done and negative during that admission. Discharged to a rehab facility for ongoing weakness.  On 5/13/21, patient?s son requested admission to hospital for further evaluation. She states that she feels confused and her legs are very heavy and she can barely move them.  Notably she lives alone in her own home, used to drive, did not use any assistive device to walk, and paid her own bills until 2 weeks ago. The symptoms did occur approximately a week after receiving her last Covid vaccine. Pt also notes around April 1, 2021 having taken an engorged deer tick off her head. 5/14/21 Lyme serology IgM &amp; IgG = negative. Neurology was consulted. She had an MRI of her thoracic and lumbar spine, as well as an LP. She had had an MRI brain at a hospital. Her MRIs did not reveal a source of her weakness and pain. Her CSF revealed albuminocytologic dissociation. Given this finding and the constellation of symptoms and LP findings, it was thought she had Guillain Barre Syndrome, presumably due to her COVID vaccine. She was given IVIG for 5 days. She improved with this.    As above, she had a recent admission for hyponatremia and hypertensive urgency. Here, her blood pressure was somewhat labile, but at times was low. She was started back on amlodipine and carvedilol, but at much lower doses with plan for ongoing monitoring. In terms of her hyponatremia, her salt tabs were stopped, and eventually her fluid restriction was able to be lifted. Her sodium was 136 at discharge.

                                                Several days following 2nd Covid vaccine, patient began experiencing visual changes including seeing &#34;sparkles&#34;, black spots, loss of color and blurriness.  8 days following the vaccine, patient lost vision in left eye and was taken to the ER and diagnosed with vasculitis. Large doses of Prednisone were administered as a means of protecting the other eye from loss of vision. A biopsy determined that the diagnosis was small cell vasculitis. Patient was in hospital for one week and returned home. Patient was under the care of specialists but becoming weaker. Approximately 6 weeks later, patient could no longer bear her own weight and was re-admitted to the hospital where additional tests were run. Medical staff were unclear what was causing the decline and patient passed away while still under their care.

She soon lost the ability to hold items in her left hand.  On May 10th she was in extreme pain, barely able to walk or hold herself up, making her mostly immobile up to the present day.  She has experienced repeated intense &#34;shock&#34; sensations down her right leg, and localized areas of intense pain in different parts of her body such as the hip bone, wrists, collarbone, and left side of temple that come and go.  In recent weeks, she&#39;s lost function of two fingers on the right hand.  For the past several weeks, she&#39;s had an intense itchy scalp.

In 2021, Vitamin B1: normal (normal) normal. In 2021, Vitamin B12: elevated (High) above 2000 pg/mL.     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosing remained unchanged.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered ENCEPHALOPATHY (Encephalopathy), STATUS EPILEPTICUS (Non-convulsive focal status epilepticus), HALLUCINATION, VISUAL (visual hallucinations), CONFUSIONAL STATE (acute confusion) and HEADACHE (left frontal headache) to be possibly related. No further causality assessment was provided for URINARY TRACT INFECTION (urinary tract infection).    Patient was at baseline neurological function. Patient had no evidence of cognitive dysfunction at baseline and no known neurological or psychiatric history. Patient had never used tobacco, alcohol nor any other illicit drugs. Their was no evidence of giant cell arteritis. Patient had no family history of seizures. Patient was seen in outpatient neurology clinic one month post hospitalization with baseline neurological status. Patient also reported she received 2nd Moderna vaccine 2 weeks post hospitalization and only experienced local injection soreness.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. This is a literature case.

                                                On Saturday while getting your night medicines from the shelf, and started feeling dizzy, tried to reach the shelf and said to herself that &#34;i can&#39;t do it, I just can&#39;t do it&#34;.  She staggered back and sat down on a towel hamper and apparently fell off of that onto the floor, lost kidney function.  Tried to get up and managed to get her phone out and called her husband (he&#39;s hard of hearing - was downstairs).  She said when he got there her head was towards the bathroom door and felt that he could not get in and could not get her up so she tried to get up.  She did not have any strength.  Finally she got up to get on her elbow and crawled into the vanity area and raised up and pulled herself up.  She did not enough strength to walk to the bed.   She got to the bed and then started with chills, turned on her electric blanket.  She felt better Sunday, 1/7/21, and is real shaky today.  She feels a little stronger but is not back to where she wants to be.  Yesterday evening she felt her arm itching a little bit, and looked at it and it was swollen and red, and had an area about the size of her hand.  Her husband felt of it and said that he felt she had fever in it.  The arm was sore to touch.  It is itching a little bit this morning.  She had a headache for a couple of days as well, took a Tylenol one night and her head felt real weird.  It was not real severe, and it hurt more times than it did others.  It would come and go.  Has not taken anything else for these symptoms.   Her husband checked her BP, Friday was 108/62, and last night 106/67.

About 5:00 PM her mouth started watering and she got the drive heaves, and then about 15 minutes and then started having them bad.  She laid down and after 15 minutes she could not breath, couldn&#39;t get any air.  When she was able to get some air, her throat was sore and she was really hoarse.  Later in the evening she laid down again and the breathing difficulty happened again and it was worse.  She was scared to the point that she was afraid to lie down.   She is fatigued.  She finally fell asleep during the night and didn&#39;t sleep much and today is very tired.  She called her doctor this morning, and talked to the nurse.   They told her if it got worse to go to the ER.  Told her to call the CDC.

                                                After waiting here 15 minutes she got up to walk back to her apartment. She began to feel a little light headed, dizzy, and and warm. She felt like she needed to sit down immediately. Her temperature and BP were check; both were normal. We gave her some water and cold towel to put on the back of her neck then had her sit down for a while longer till she was feeling better. She said she felt immediately better after the water and after a while a facility staff member came to take her home.  As I talked to her she did tell me that she has a history of passing out so this may have played a part in the event.

She reports that approximately 1.5hrs after receiving her COVID vaccine, she began having pain in the top of her head, neck, between her shoulder blades, down both arms to her fingertips, and down her spine.  Reports also began having swelling in her feet. Reports having nausea and pain in her chest with walking. She reports she already had trouble with ambulation prior to vaccine, but it has been worse since receiving the vaccine. She reports as of 3/3/21, the pain is still occurring and not getting better.  She has not seen her primary doctor since being vaccinated. I encouraged her to speak with her doctor or schedule a visit with them as her pain is not improving.

My mother is in assisted living and was able to transfer from chair to wheelchair and feed herself as well as move her body independent of help. The same day she had her COVID shot she complained of severe pain in her right arm, within days she was no longer able to move and was rushed to the emergency. After routine tests, they were not able to determine the cause of pain and problem. I did ask if there could be a connection to the vaccine but they didn&#39;t know.

Other than a minor soreness in the arm, I had no adverse effects. On Friday, January 22nd, however, the area around the injection site became red and warm. At this time, two days later, the inflammation continues and the reddish &#34;patch&#34; is beginning to itch. Just thought that you would want a report of this delayed reaction.&#34; Per conversation with patient, on this date 1/25/21, pt reports that she is still experiencing small amount of itching as well as redness and slight sensitivity to the injection site.  Pt denies need for further medical care, and that she is fine but thought we should know.

                                                On Friday, February 18th, 2021, patient received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid administered by Pharm D at our pharmacy. The patient called the pharmacy on March 4th, 2021 to explain that her arm was red and itchy.  The pharmacist that day told the patient to use ice compresses and to come by the pharmacy to show us her reaction.   Today, March 5th, the patient came to the pharmacy with her son to show us her left deltoid. I observed her arm was red and hot to the touch. She has very defined edges of the rash on her arm. She did not have streaking on her arm, that I observed.  Patient said she had a small, red spot about 3 days after she received the shot, which started February 21st .  She was complaining of itching and has been watching the red spot get bigger every day. I instructed her to call you to have you look at her arm. She said it was just itching and she would like to try OTC products before going to the doctor.  I instructed her to take Benadryl 25mg up to four times per day.  Because Benadryl will make her tired, she can only take it when she is at home and not driving.  I also gave her Hydrocortisone 1% ointment to use at least twice per day on her arm.  I also reiterated that ice packs would help with the redness and discomfort.  She verbalized her understanding. I instructed her to call you to make an appointment if she is not improving. I also told her if she sees any signs of continued spreading or red streaks on her arm, she needs to seek immediate medical attention.

Then on 2/11/21 she had an ocular migraine, and as that ended she was hit with an intense pain in her head that she had never experienced before.  It lasted for hours, for the rest of the day.  She took Ibuprofen which did not do anything.  She looked up online and the  clinic had a report on what to do for the migraines, and she took Ibuprofen and strong coffee.  She does that and was able to ward it off and stop it some.  Then it continued to happen during the day and the pain is so intense.  The day before yesterday, 3/9/21 the regimen of coffee and ibuprofen did not improve.  It goes from the top of her head, down to her neck and sore to touch behind her ears.  It is now a dull headache around her whole upper skull.  She lives alone and her children do not live anywhere close to her.  She is also having horrendous fatigue and is not able to get much done such as shopping, also shortness of breath and pounding heart beat generally is very active and some days she is not able to get dressed due to the symptoms.   She went to UC and she had them do a COVID test, which was negative and sent to the ER at and her BP was 191/75, and was told to FU with her neurologist and internist and had no answers for her headaches.

                                                approx. ten or eleven days after receiving the Moderna  vaccine, my mother experienced fatigue, nausea, body aches and a fever. Within hours, her body was inflamed with rashes from head to toe, with hives in certain spots, and she looks sunburned all over her body.  She is extremely itchy and in pain and generally very uncomfortable.

The INR test read 3.9 and is normally 2.5 or 2.6.  She was told this was extremely high.  She had to go back on 4/5/2021 and have a repeated INR test and it was back down to 2.6.  She feels like taking the Vax made this test result to be higher than normal since there had been no other changes in taking her meds at that time.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No Reported Past Medical History.) on 15-Mar-2021.   On 15-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced SOMNOLENCE (lot of sleepiness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 18-Mar-2021, the patient experienced GAIT INABILITY (unable to stand or walk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), TREMOR (tremors in her legs which as the days progressed spread to her whole body, arms, head, and) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ADVERSE REACTION (reaction may have been a heightened extreme immune response to the second dose of the) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 18-Mar-2021 to 25-Mar-2021 due to ADVERSE REACTION, GAIT INABILITY, SOMNOLENCE and TREMOR. At the time of the report, SOMNOLENCE (lot of sleepiness), GAIT INABILITY (unable to stand or walk), TREMOR (tremors in her legs which as the days progressed spread to her whole body, arms, head, and) and ADVERSE REACTION (reaction may have been a heightened extreme immune response to the second dose of the) outcome was unknown.            No concomitant medications were reported.  No treatments were reported.  During hospitalization, patient underwent numerous tests such as MRI and Xrays to rule out other diagnoses.  All tests came back negative. Pt has been in rehabilitation facility since 26MAR2021. Her tremors are lessening in frequency and intensity.  She is able to walk for short periods of time and use a walker as well.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 88-year-old female hospitalized with serious unexpected events of adverse reaction, somnolence, tremor and gait inability. Event onset the same day as second dose mRNA-1273. Event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

It was likely she had sudden death as she did not activate her neck alert or call button in her apartment.  Family request we report the incident, she was last seen on 12/15/2020 for pacemaker check, she also had medical message communication with me on 2/8 to request refill on her Percocet that she takes occ for her joint pain only at bed time.  family suspect possible DVT with PE after getting more informed about vaccine side effects. however no autopsy was done.

                                                Later on the day of the vaccine, I developed difficulty speaking and walking. My son brought me to the ER the following day. They ran  tests and ruled out stroke and other known causes of my neurological problems. I showed improvement the next day so they sent me home. My symptoms continued and worsened over a few weeks. My children called the ambulance on March 17. My body temp was 88 when I arrived at the ER and heartrate in 30s. I stayed in the hospital for 7 days but have no memory of that or the week before. As the Drs could not find a cause or remedy to symptoms, I was discharged to hospice care. I have improved at home with a lot of assistance but am not back to my pre-vaccine strength, energy, or coordination.

About a week later she found a lump by accident under her arm in the armpit but down a little further towards her breast.  The lump is painful when she puts pressure on it when she&#39;s trying to sleep.  She knows it&#39;s there.  She went to her PCP yesterday, 5/24/21 and he told her that they will watch it and it should dissipate.  He did not give her any treatment for it.  She did also have a stiff neck on the side of her vaccine and a headache, which have disappeared.  She just wishes it would go away as it&#39;s a nuisance.  Her doctor said that it was swelling of the lymph node.   If she wears something tight it hurts her, but otherwise it doesn&#39;t, especially if she wears a bra.  She just does not have the energy that she had before.    She did get a Prolia shot on 2/4/21 but had no reactions from that, and was told that it would not interfere with the vaccine.

She did fall about 2 months ago due to the weakness, she hurt her leg and has not healed since then.  She did go to the ER due to the weakness and they could not find any reason to keep her.   She fell when she tried to get up at night and fell onto a night stand and landed in-between that and the bed and has a bad spot on her leg.  The wound is not healing and they are trying to get her into a wound care center as  nothing has helped it.  She is now having therapy and they have been putting ointment on it and it is not healing.  Home health comes to her house and she is on a walker and doing different exercises on them so that she can get back to having her strength back and able to walk.   She was not using the walker before having the vaccine.  She is now confined to her house and not able to get in the car and go where she wants to go.

On Saturday, January 23rd, she was exhausted and unable to get up. We learned this from a friend of hers who had called us back after both my brother and I were unable to reach her by phone.  This was about 3:15 pm and we drove to her apartment and found her semi conscious in her bed. We awoke her but she was unable to talk or get up. We then called 911 and emergency paramedics came and took her to hospital.

                                                My mother has experienced a severe reaction to her vaccine. Diagnosed with brain encephalopathy probably caused by molecular mimicry in response to the Covid vaccine, she is now being treated as an inpatient at the Clinic.  She was fully independent- living alone, mobile, with excellent cognitive function.  On January 21, 2021 she received her 1st Moderna vaccine. Subsequently family noticed small balance changes, slight fine motor coordination changes (handwriting, etc) and a little forgetfulness not previously seen. Everything was chalked up to her being 89 years old.  She remained independent and relatively fully functional.  Patient is now unable to stand without assistance, leans backward when trying to stand, has developed a spastic tremor bilaterally in her arms, and her cognition is completely altered.  Hallucinations, memory loss, can follow some directions but not all, speech clear but inappropriate.  This declines DAILY. As of March 7th, she could not identify immediate family members in a photo. These changes have all occurred within the past few weeks and appear to have an acute underlying cause not related to age.    Medical staff are looking at an autoimmune encephalitis picture based on the antibodies developed from the vaccine attacking the tissue in the brain and spinal cord that resembles the small piece of the vaccine.    She is currently at the Clinic affiliated hospital. At this time, family is contacting Clinic main campus to request further investigation.   Photographic evidence of rapid decline available, but not able to attach to this form:   Available are three pictures of a log patient keeps with her vitals that she was doing every day.  1. Personal log of vital signs pre Covid vaccine/dose 1 - you can see the handwriting is concise, clear, and orderly.   2. Personal log of vitals after Covid dose 1 on Jan. 21 - slight changes in the handwriting and orderliness but still ok.  3. Personal log of vitals after Covid vaccine dose 2  Feb. 17 - note the illegible handwriting, missing entries, and no spatial awareness of line alignment.  Available are three photos of crossword puzzles she does every day.    1. Puzzle dated Feb.12. Demonstrates her ability to accurately fill most answers with clear writing.   2. Puzzle dated Feb.19 shows an ability to fill in only a couple answers with obvious handwriting changes.   3. Puzzle dated Feb. 21 shows inability to complete, and a strange discrepancy between ability and inability- note 29 across and 18 down.  Patients outcome is undetermined as diagnosis/treatment and prognosis are ongoing.

                                                History of Present Illness     89-year-old female with past medical history significant for osteoporosis and hypothyroidism, who initially presented to ER on March 2 due to lower extremity weakness and right knee pain after a recent fall.  Patient lost her balance and suffered a mechanical fall on February 22.  Patient developed right lumbar and hip pain radiating down her leg.  She saw Dr from orthopedics on February 26 who recommended offloading knee and wearing a knee immobilizer.  Patient was admitted to hospital on March 2 due to worsening knee pain and was incidentally found to be positive for COVID-19.  Patient had received her second Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on February 26.  Patient was evaluated by neurology during that hospital course, who recommended outpatient EMG, physical therapy, and pain management.  No evidence of Guillain-Barré or viral induced neuropathy.  Patient&#39;s lower extremity weakness did improve, and she was successfully discharged home with family and home health on March 5.   Patient reports doing well at home with family initially, was making improvements with her strength and was able to stand and take a few steps with walker and assistance.  On March 8, patient was in bed and she attempted to turn onto her right side, and as she was turning she felt a pop and a pain in her right hip that radiated down her right leg.  Since that time, patient reports having severe pain with movement, rates pain as 8/10 severity.  Denies falls or new trauma since her previous fall from February 22.  Patient was unable to control pain at home, so she came into the emergency department for evaluation.  Initial hip x-ray series revealed questionable greater trochanteric fracture.  CT of right hip subsequently revealed fracture.  Orthopedics consulted.  No significant laboratory abnormalities.  Foley catheter was placed in ER.  Patient was admitted to hospital service for management.  On my interview, patient reports that right hip pain is under good control as long as she does not move, but has 7/10 pain severity over her right lateral hip with movement.   Patient reports following Covid isolation protocols at home with family.  Reports that her Covid isolation will be completed on March 12.  Denies upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient has oxygen saturations of 100% on room air.

                                                This was the 2nd Moderna Shot on 2-18-2021.  She received the first shot on 1-22-2021. Patient verbally reported to me that about 4 hours after the shot, she began experiencing severe shocks all over her face and into her left neck and chest area.  This quickly worsened to include her left arm.  That all resolved after a nap.  But when she woke up, and went to the mirror, she noted that her left face was slow and drooping.  She went to the ER.  It was noted that she was having a severe problem with swallowing.  She also was noting severe pain in left external ear canal.  She had obvious severe breakout in the left ear canal - and the immediate area.  She was sent home - and came to my office the next day.  By that time, the symptoms had become much much worse.  She was unable to swallow.  The outbreak in the left ear was much more pronounced.  And her entire left face and left tongue were paralyzed.  She was diagnosed with the Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome - she was unable to talk or swallow.  She was readmitted back into the hospital.

                                                To whom it may concern, Nov. 9, 2020:   I was taken to hospital to diagnose why I was sleeping (up to 20hours a day) and so drained.  I was diagnosed with Covid-19, Pneumonia and was hospitalized for a week and half.  I was not on respiratory equipment during this time. Jan. 12, 2021:  Received First Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Shot 1:15 p.m. At 10 p.m. I started, uncontrollable, none stop, and full body shaking (not shiver but shaking) that lasted over an hour.  I called my son and 911 who sent an ambulance.  My son said he thought I looked like I was having a seizure.  The EMT said the only way I could find out what was happening would be to go to the hospital which I chose not to because I did not want to be re-exposed to Covid-19.  The EMT suggested I take Benadryl.  After the initial hour and taking a Benadryl my shaking subsided.   I slept almost around the clock for 3 days.  Feb. 9, 2021:  Received Second Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Shot 1:30 p.m. At 7 p.m. I was fine and talked to my son on phone.  By 7:30 PM I had started shaking as described above.   I called my son to the house and he gave me a Benadryl again.  He held my head and shoulders during this shaking episode to keep my shaking from hurting my neck.  After an hour or so the shaking again subsided.  During the time the shaking was waning my son took a video of my shaking, in which I was shaking just not violently.  Again, I slept 3 days.  We have concluded these episodes are related to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Shot. April 5, 2021:  Appointment with Dr.  During my doctor?s appointment I told the doctor of my experiences and showed him the video. The doctor said he hadn?t heard of this reaction.  I asked him about the advisability of taking a booster shot.  The doctor said we would have to wait and see. May 23, 2021    My questions are: Have you heard of this reaction before?  If so, can you supply me with the information you have about it? If a booster is recommended, should I take it or how can I evaluate the risks either way? HOW WILL I BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THRU WITH THIS?
