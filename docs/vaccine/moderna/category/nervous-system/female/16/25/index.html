Another staff member had checked the online appointments the day before and did not see any discrepancies in the ages of our appointments.This client was 16. Client had made the appointment after her checking this. Client was shown to the registration desk where they are told it is Moderna  vaccine. It is advertised we have Moderna. Father was present the whole time and did not get vaccinated. Client had no adverse effects after getting vaccine, nor in the observation area. We caught the error when it could not be entered into the system. I called the client on MondayJanuary 25. Client said she only had a sore arm. I explained what happened and that her second dose would not be Moderna. Client called me later in the day and was asking more questions about what will happen when her second dose comes up. Then she said she has a lawyer and to whom should see address it to.

Seizures can be a feature of this disorder but the patient had not experienced one in the past. Her parents report that her Neurologist does not believe the seizure to be related to vaccination. I informed parents I would search the VAERS system for similar reports. They were not enrolled in V-Safe, but I encouraged them to do so and gave them a link to the CDC site for registration. Correspondence with CDC (via email): &#34;If the Moderna vaccine is inadvertently administered to patients 16 or 17 years old instead of Pfizer-BioNTech as the first dose, CDC currently recommends that the Moderna vaccine may be administered as the second dose (as off-label use). The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible, 28 days for the Moderna vaccine. Additional information regarding administration errors and deviations can be found in CDC?s current interim clinical considerations regarding mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

Instead of just wasting the doses we called anyone we could think of that could make it in before 1500. 1500 was when the vaccine was no longer within the 6 hour reconstitution period. I was the person who called my sister and she brought my niece with her. I believed her to be 18 but she is only 16 1/2 and the Shot was given already, before this was noticed. She waited the 15 minutes had no issues and went home with her Mother.  The only side effects noted to me was a sore arm and a slight Head Ache.

A few days after that my muscles started twitching and haven&#39;t stopped. I feel like something is crawling under my skin and the vaccine is extremely affecting my nervous system. I did not have this problem before I had the vaccine. It has not gone away and it is now April 23rd I still feel weak, not the same as I used to feel before having the vaccine, and my muscles are twitching all over my body. My face is twitching and my eye and there is nothing I can do to make it stop. I am so young and I thought the vaccine was safe but I am suffering from it. Especially in my feet I feel like they are tingling and vibrating and my calves are convulsing too. Meanwhile, my heart is fluttering and I feel like it is very hard for me to focus and I feel things crawling under my skin in my brain.  The muscle convulsions are happening everywhere.

                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                For my first dose, I had quite mild symptoms. I woke up with a migraine the next morning and some soreness at the injection site. Both of these lasted a couple of days and were able to be treated with over-the-counter pain medicine. My second dose, however, provided much worse flu-like symptoms. About 12 hours after I received the injection, I was woken with a migraine much worse than the first, nausea, chills, joint pain, sore throat, and fatigue. While the chills and nausea subsided, the other symptoms persisted until the next day. As of today (2/4/21), all symptoms are gone except for soreness at the injection site.

                                                Patient received vaccine around 430pm. As she was sitting for post-vaccine observation she told an associate to call over Rph due to side effects. After speaking with patient she stated that her arm was numb (vaccinated arm) and that it hurt more than when she got her flu shot. I assessed both arms an her vaccinated arm was slightly swollen. I described the signs of anaphylaxis to her and told her that i would like for her to stay longer for extra monitoring and to alarm me or one of my associates if any anaphylaxis symptoms occur. Patients blood pressure was taken reading - 132/96. Patient was unsure of her baseline so i explained i will check again shortly. Patient was given water and one dose of Benadryl (25mg) at 5:25pm as well as an ice pack to place on her arm. At 6:00pm patients blood pressure was retaken (124/82) and patient stated she was well enough to go home. Her grandma was with her and stated she didn&#39;t have Benadryl at home, I recommend her to get some and gave the patient another dose (25mg) before her grandma took her home.  Patient has no primary care physician.

                                                immediately after the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine was injected into her left arm she began to have significant tingling sensation that then very quickly spread to her whole body.    Shortly after that she had tingling in her lips and tongue and a sensation in her throat she could not swallow easily    she did not have labored breathing or drop her sats.       She went to the local ER  (had already left the injection facility and then called our office and directed to the ED and to take a zyrtec on the way as she had prior difficulty with benadryl) ) and they gave her injectable steroids and pepcid with short observation and sent her home.      her symptoms lasted a total of 4 hours and completely resolved after that

She felt like her fingernails were even hurting her. She said her body had pins and needles feeling. She has stayed hydrated. The fatigue is just to severe for her to get out of bed and even do online school is not possible. Vaccine was given Mon. afternoon and now its Wed. afternoon. Her fever has finally broke and hopefully stays away. Her body always responds to ibroprofen with the sweats pretty fast and a reduction in temperature but this time her body has not been receptive. She wouldn&#39;t even get a sweat like usual. She was dosed at 800mg. I have not taken her to the Dr. but will tomorrow if necessary.

About 10 minutes after the shot (in my Left arm) my left thigh started to go numb. The numbness then spread to the rest of my left leg, as well as my left arm, and my left cheek. I went to the hospital to ensure that it didn&#39;t get worse, and they checked my vitals and ran some blood tests, and they said everything looked normal, and my symptoms would hopefully go away. In the days after, most of the numbness has gone awa, my left leg has still felt kind of achy, but it is slowly disappearing &#34;.

                                                Pain and soreness in vaccination arm was immediate for the rest of the day. Started feeling achey and feverish at the end of the day towards nighttime and bedtime. Took a Tylenol before going to bed. Woke up at 6:00a.m. feeling achey and feverish again, more severe this time. Attempted to walk to get another Tylenol and take my temperature, vision blurred and was extremely cold, immediate nausea, felt like I was going to pass out. Shaking and chills. After drinking Gatorade, ginger ale and water and eating peanut butter toast, nausea settled. After a bit, experienced severe stomach cramps. Drank more ginger ale and Gatorade and took a Tylenol to relieve pain. After 30-45 minutes, pain relieved and I was able to go back to bed. Rest of the day experienced pounding headache and feverish and achey body. Experienced fever highest at 99.8 during the day. After 24 hours passed, feel 100% better and all symptoms and side effects relieved. Only thing sustaining is a little bit of pain and soreness in the arm.

Remained in pharmacy area for about 30 minutes post-administration with no further incident.  Patient&#39;s mother notified us today that patient had a seizure several hours later that same day at approx 12 noon.

                                                Initially she passed out following the vaccine - within 90 seconds- she has a history of passing out with injections and blood draws. Around noon she had a seizure. She describes a feeling of darkness and dread closing in on her and she was unable to speak or move. She was on the stairs at the time. I witnessed her stiffen, then go limp and fall between the electric stair hair and the wall. She hit the hardwood floor face first then she began to shake/twitch. She was unconscious. She awoke screaming, incoherent speech, and flailing limbs. It took about 5 minutes to calm her and be able to understand her speech. She only remembers the darkness and waking up scared and feeling awful. She was put supine on the floor with feet elevated, blood pressure monitored, given juice to drink, and vitals checked routinely. After about an hour supine and conscious, she felt good enough to sit up. She sat up for 15 minutes before she was able to stand with assistance. Family physician was notified immediately and we are still waiting for a response. She has a goose egg sized knot on her forehead, a bruise on the side of her face and a black eye from hitting the floor. She has a huge bruise on her outer thigh and lower leg where she hit the stair chair and then seized and it it repeatedly on the metal. She has underarm pain from where her armpit hit the edge of the stairs when she fell and seized. She has no history of any types of seizures.

                                                I had horrible shaking/trembling in my arms, chest, and legs about six hours after the vaccine, and they continued for about four hours more, uncontrollably. I passed out briefly around 12 hours after the vaccine, and I&#39;m not sure how long I remained unconscious. Through all of this, my left arm was difficult to move or use, I felt hot suddenly and then cold, and I was tired. The next day, the most serious side effects were gone, but I remained feverish, tired, and largely unable to move my left arm. Those side effects were gone on the third day and now I&#39;m better.

Patient mentioned both her hands were numb, then tingling. Her  mother massaged her hands. She stayed for observation for 40 minutes. She left with both her mom and dad. She said she felt ok. I called her the same evening to check in. She had a nap and said she felt fine.

Unusual issues: The day after receiving the vaccine she had several hand tremors,  and feeling as if she had several &#34;mini seizures&#34; throughout the day, a few longer staring spells, some twitches.  She felt &#34;out-of it&#34; all day.   She has petite mal seizures and a history of interictal epileptiforn discharges.  Also history of an intention tremor in her hands. (The mild tremors were primarily in her right hand, to a lesser extent the left).   Today, 2 days afterwards, today, so far, she feels better.   Yesterday was terrible, but we waited it out assuming it was injection related.

                                                Patient had felt nervous prior to getting her 2nd shot. I asked if she had every had any serious reactions from previous medicines or vaccines, she stated &#34;no&#34;. I then asked how she did after her first shot and she said ok. While waiting her 15 min in the observation area she alerted us that she was feeling extremely hot. We brought her back into the IMZ booth and had her sit in the chair and turned a fan in her direction. I sat down with her an asked her questions and kept her talking to try to calm her down. She stated that she felt as if the chair was swaying a little. We laid out a yoga mat on the floor in the booth, had her lay down and elevate her feet in a chair. She began to get upset and I asked if she had anyone with her, she was able to open her phone and gave me permission to call her family member. Family member came in the store and was able to help calm her down. We gave her some water and had her rest. I monitored her pulse and face/lip color. She became a little flushed. She was able to leave on her own accord, I did walk out with her to ensure she made it safely. I called 2 hours later to check on her and she stated she was feeling better, less dizzy, but just a little tired.

                                                approximately 3 weeks after the covid vaccination was received, my daughter began not feeling well.  She was experiencing extreme fatigue, substantially enlarged lymph nodes, a slight sore throat and mild sinus stuffiness.  Depending on the thermometer used, she either had no fever or a very low grade fever (less than 100).

She reports she had pain in her teeth and her chest felt tight. She just didn&#39;t feel well. Closer to incident student felt dizzy, like she was &#34;going to pass out&#34;.  States she turned to someone to tell that person she was not feeling well &#34;but I couldn&#39;t talk; the words would not come out&#34;. She felt herself sway and then knew she fell to the floor. She felt like she was lying still for a bit but she could hear people around her and she heard someone say &#34;somebody start timing this&#34; (as if they knew it was a seizure).

Pharmacist confirmed with the patient if she experienced any adverse reaction after she received her first dose. Patient stated after first dose she felt week but nothing major happened.  About 8-10 minutes after vaccine was given, patients started having some side effect such as nausea/vomiting and dizziness. she stated that she feels burning up. She denied any shortness of breath.

One of the technician called patient&#39;s mom. Patient stated she had not ate any thing in the morning so she was given water and some protein bar. Patient waited until all symptoms resolved (with supervision of the pharmacist) and after she felt better patient&#39;s mom took her home.

I monitored her closely for 20 to 30 minutes, at this time she stated she had begun to experience tingling in her arms and hands. At that time, I suggested to her aunt(legal guardian) that she be monitored in a more appropriate setting. We offered to call paramedics, the aunt on behalf of the patient declined, stating she would bring her to the ER.

Immunizer then turned around to give her brother vaccination. When he was turned around, he heard the patient&#39;s phone that she was holding dropped and that she had jerked her arm, which caused her phone to drop. When I went to the patient, she was crying and hyperventilating. I told her to put her head down and take deep breaths. I checked on pt in 15 min, was doing better but had burning sensation at injection site. Kept pt at pharmacy for 30 minutes.

                                                Pt explained on Covid-19 consent form that she has syncope when seeing a needle. She explained she has an intense fear of needles and has fainted in the past when getting vaccinations. She also explained that she has anxiety. She explained that when she faints it looks like a seizure but it is not. When pt was given shot she was responsive during the needle going in.  She was in a seated position. We talked the entire time of administration. After putting the the bandage on her right arm she explained she felt sick(about 40 seconds after injection).  She was still responsive for about two minutes then she fainted and her body shook about two times.  My coworker and I got her on the ground, she was still responsive enough to ask for a cup of water. Which we gave her, she then went unresponsive for 20 seconds and spilled the water. After this we sat with her on the ground for another 5 minutes and she said she was fine. We helped her to a seated position.  We then made her wait  another 30 minutes in our waiting area. She assured us she was fine and reiterated that this has happened before in the past anytime a needle was involved.  On 5/2/2021 she was contacted and she explained she looked a little pale throughout the day of vaccination, but feels fine now and just has a sore arm.

I had her sit in head down position for several minutes and started to monitor her vitals. Prior to vaccine pt was having severe anxiety and has a history of syncope with blood drawns. After several mins of her sitting with ehr head down I checked her blood pressure and it was elevated 155/109 mmHg. 10 minutes later pt felt a little better but started to feel faint and dizzy again. I called emergency sevices and EMS arrived at the scene, assessed the patient and diagnosed her with anxiety/syncope. She opted out from going to the hospital with them. She left the store at 1:01 pm and felt alot better and stated she had an appt with her PCP at 3pm to further seek medical treatment if deemed necessary

I went to check on her and offered her a cold compress for the back of her neck to help her cool down.  After another 5 minutes I went to check on her and the patients mother said she still did not feel good and she would like to have her checked out.  I explained that what she was experience were normal side effects of the vaccine, and she still wanted me to call EMS.  I called 911 and spoke to the dispatcher about her symptoms.  EMS came and checked her blood sugar, and blood pressure which were fine.  They instructed her to rest and explained those were normal symptoms.

                                                The first day, I had slight arm soreness with nothing more. When I woke up on day two, I noticed my arm had swelled more than usual (basing off my previous dose in my right arm) and was extremely hot, tender, and had two circular red patches. That night, the redness and swelling had spread into a medium sized circle, and began to itch and still be very hot upon touch. Upon looking later that night, at approximately 11pm EST, the swelling and redness had gotten larger.  On day three, the redness only got worse, and is slowly spread more over the area, with intense itching, but no longer is as sore as it was the day prior. I have iced the area, moved my arm around more to help the swelling go down, taken a hot shower, and about 600mg of Ibuprofen each day since the second dose. The only outcome to those treatments has been a significant decrease in pain level, but the swelling and redness still continues. This has all been over about a 48-72 hour time period

Quickly fades/is not persistent after swallowing.  Not unpleasant: think fizzy drink sensation but toned  down by a tenfold, almost muted. As of writing (00:26) sensation still occurs when I drink water.

Needed assistance to stand and could not hold a pencil to write. Also numbness and tingling in hands and fingers. Face slightly swollen and red.  400 mg Ibuprofen was administered at  1530. Pushed fluids as soon as fever began. Cooling measures provided, cool shower, cold compress, change of clothes to light pajamas.  We contacted our Insurance 24 hour Nurse line at approximately 2100 when symptoms peaked. The RN on staff instructed us to seek immediate medical care.  We attempted to find an open Urgent Care unsuccessfully and tried to go to an ER but they were full. Fever began to come down around 2230, so we returned home. Continued with ibuprofen every six hours and cooling measures.

She quickly regained consciousness after approximately 1 minute of lost consciousness. The pharmacist on duty then asked the patient if she had eaten and drank today, to which she responded that she had not. The pharmacist then provided a granola bar and water.  The pharmacist also took the patient&#39;s blood pressure, measuring  92/58 mmHg with a pulse of 60 bpm. She then took a second reading 5 minutes later, measuring 112/68 mmHg. The patient quickly recovered and was able to leave without further medical attention.

It is very odd, but she has never had this issue. Also, she has never suffered from headaches until after this second shot. This has been going on for almost a month. We don&#39;t know what to do about it.

I monitored her and decided to get  her a bag in case she had to throw up. She threw up suddenly.  She said she was feeling much better and the warmth and nausea was a level 2 (On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most severe). I informed her that I will have to monitor her for an additional 15 minutes because of her event. She waited a total of about 40 minutes after her injection. She said she felt fine and left. I called her later during the day. She said she was still okay without any problems. I informed her to seek the counsel of her doctor for the doctor to decide on whether or not she should get her second Covid shot.

She was given the vaccine at 3:10PM and at 5 minutes (3:15PM) she begins to complain that she is dizzy, then says she feels nauseous and begins to shake. I proceed to take his blood pressure and he had 128/89 and a pulse at 126. He called 911 and when they arrived they checked his blood pressure and sugar levels and everything came out normal. Paramedics took her to the hospital. At 6:00PM, an Medical Staff came to inform us that she had contacted the patient and she informed her that she was fine and that the doctor told her that it was the fright that caused the reaction.

                                                The very next morning after the vaccination around 7:00 AM , my right arm was hurting, it was not red, or there wasn&#39;t any bruising.  I had tightness in my throat, it was pretty much like an anaphylactic  shock is how the doctors described it. I had white bumps, like welts,   on the back of my throat and tongue. And the roof of my mouth and my tongue, my lips everything in my mouth was swollen. My eyes were almost swollen shut. On 12/27/2021,  I had a doctor video visit. He advised me to take Benadryl, and Tylenol,  I used my albuterol  inhaler several times because I couldn&#39;t breath. So around 3:00 pm I went to the Emergency Room because I was still having a hard time breathing and the swelling wasn&#39;t going down.  The doctor immediately gave me an Epi pen. and told me i had an allergic reaction to the vaccination. The doctor advised me that it was up to me to take the 2nd vaccination . He said it was up to me.

                                                Immediately after receiving the injection, the patient passed out. She was already in the proper sitting position, and I ( immunizer) saw that she was passing out. I had just placed the syringe in the sharps container and was about to place her bandage on, when her head went slack and I saw her eyes roll. I immediately leaned one arm over her to keep her from falling out of the chair, while using my other hand to steady her neck and head. The patients mother was in the room with us, and was talking to her daughter, trying to revive her. I informed the patients mother that I would be unable to leave her daughter, and gave her the name of my pharmacist on duty and asked her to step out and go to the consult window and have him come back to the immunization room. Pharmacist and the patients mother returned in short order and pharmacist verified what I had already checked that she was showing signs of breathing, chest was rising and falling. He helped support her head and asked the mother to gently rub her face to try to wake the patient back up. He stepped out briefly while I was continuing to support the patient and came back with some wet paper towels to place on the back of the patients neck and forehead. After approx. 10 minutes the patient came to and was able to stand and walk under her own power. She sat in the waiting room for an additional 15 minutes before leaving.

She was given an ice pack to apply to sight and also mentioned some chest tightness. She has asthma and her albuterol inhaler was at home.She said it felt like normal asthma symptoms. we recommended her take some of her own benadryl she had on her around 1120am. We had her move over to a bench and filled an emergency albuterol and she did 2 puffs at 11:28 when chest tightness worsened.  Called 911 at this point and patient had laid down. Her tongue felt tight and when lips and eyes started swelling the pharmacist administered an Epipen 0.3mg. EMT arrived about 1145am and took her in a wheelchair to ER.

When RN and I reached patient she was very weak, she was sitting in a chair. I instructed her colleauges to call 911 immediately. Patient was having a little trouble breathing. I think she was scared. I gave her 10 mlL of benedryl and RN administered a 0.5 mL dose of epinephine in her left arm. Patient was helped to the  floor and her feet were elevated.  RN put on a blood pressure cuff. Before she could get a reading, the paramedics were there and took over. Patient was transported to Hospital.

The body aches were so intense I couldn?t dress myself in the morning. All of my lymph nodes in my neck, ribs, and collar bones were incredibly swollen and hurt when touched. I rotated Tylenol and Advil with no relief. My fatigue was like no other. My headache wouldn?t go away either. 48 hours after the vaccine, I still had body aches and swollen lymph nodes in my neck to the point of pain when turning my neck.

Dr. was updated  and we had orders for close monitoring, the next day when she got up, her leg appeared better, and she had passed a small BM, but by lunch she had developed significant pain and edema in her left leg, and the color of her leg was reddened again.  She was sent to the emergency room with  her symptoms.   She was admitted back to our facility  yesterday, her diagnoses included Acute provoked left external illiac, femoral, popliteal, and peroneal DVT.  Elevated Factor II levels, Elevated APC resistant, May-Thurner Syndrome, history of developmental disabilities, fecal impaction and urinary retention - suspected related to her fecal impaction.  Vascular surgery was consulted,  and pt. was  started on a heparin drip, and mechanical thrombectomy was needed for both legs due to multiple clots.  She was started on Eliquis and Plavix, and thigh high compression stockings were ordered, ace wraps being used until these are supplied.  Her Fecal impaction was addressed also and the urinary retention resolved.

One week from the date of my vaccine, I woke up with a swollen and red arm below the injection site. It was itchy and painful. This has persisted for two days and I saw a physician for it. We are currently monitoring the site for possible cellulitis.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

The physician responsible for the vaccine administration needs to be retrained on where to give deltoid muscle IM injections and to avoid the extremities where recent surgeries occurred (patient had right shoulder labrum repair in October 2020)

                                                Patient developed a fever to 102.3 and had a decreased level of responsiveness with rigors. An infectious evaluation including COVID 19 testing, respiratory viral panel, basic lab evaluation (including CBC and CMP), and physical exam were all unremarkable. She was provided PR acetaminophen which reduced her fever and she returned to normal. After clinical improvement, she mentioned that she has developed similar reactions to previous medications (PCN) and vaccines (unknown which type) that always improve with acetaminophen. She did not annotate this on her vaccine screening form. She was provided acetaminophen and had no further symptoms. Will plan to provide her with scheduled acetaminophen after dose 2.

                                                At 6pm on Feb 19, I was very cold no matter how many layers of clothing I put on. Around 8pm I started getting chills and a headache. Around 10pm I almost fainted going up the stairs (I turned white and felt the blood drain from my face, I got very dizzy and had to sit down with supervision). I woke up at 12:30am and had a fever of 101 F and took some acetometaphine to hopefully lower my fever. I checked my temperature again at 8:30am this morning (feb 20) and was at 99.5 F and a slight headache.

She cam back in side the room and we had a nurse assess her, her BP and heart rate were a  little elevated. We gave her some water and had her sit for some extra time while we talked to her. She has a child hood trauma regarding vaccine and had just had a major panic attack before and during her vaccination. We were all  pretty sure she had just worked her self up and was not feeling well because of that and she said as much herself. After about 15-20 more minutes her BP and heart rate were back to normal and although still feeling a little weak she was ready to go home with her mother.

By 3am I figured the only reason I wasn?t sleep was from the vaccine. I then started to feel extremely nauseous and had chills. At 3:30 am I took my temperature and it was 100.5. I laid in bed until 5am with no sleep still and took my temperature again and it was 103.5. I went back into my bed and fell asleep around 5:30 am. The next day I felt as though I had been hit by a truck. I felt extremely groggy and achy and my temperature when I woke up was around 100. Overall, I felt awful.

Fifteen minutes late she returned to the pharmacy says she was dizzy and nauseated. We had her sit in the pharmacy for about 20 minutes at whichn time she said she felt better and was ready to go. We had one of our pharmacists walk her but she became dizzy and nauseated again and had to sit down. At this time she said she was hot and very light headed and her vision was starting to get blurry. A minute or so lefter that she sat up in her chair and stopped breathing and started to fall off. One of our pharmacists caugt her and at point she went into convulsions and started gagging and could not breath. 911 was called at this time and an Epi pen was administered.

I was either really cold or really hot, no in between. I was fatigued for a week after the vaccine. I had shortness of breath and I got my vaccine on a Friday and was sick throughout the entire weekend until Tuesday.

I got out of bed and tried to eat yogurt, but felt nauseous and got lightheaded so I had to sit down. I drank some tea and water and went back to bed for 4 hours. I woke up again and still felt terrible and could not even walk short distances without getting very pale, sweaty,  and my vision having spots. I feel chills, a headache, and have been lying down all day. I am most concerned about passing out and becoming unconscious.  I called the Wellness Center and they said to just lie down and stay hydrated

                                                A few minutes after getting the vaccine she started getting light-headed, nauseous, sweats, and blurred vision prior to getting up and informing the pharmacy staff. Pharmacist gave water. She had turned a yellow color. Mother gave liquid Benadryl - adult dose. Epi was offered - but not use.  Decided to see if Benadryl got her back to normal. After the sweat she got chilled. Waited at the pharmacy for about an hour as her color came back to normal.  Had pharmacists take her blood pressure prior to leaving. It was 106/70. Which would be close to her normal range.  Pharmacist initially had trouble getting pulse and blood pressure but was also using the same arm the vaccination was put into. Pharmacist got that blood pressure off the alternate arm. She went to lunch with Mother afterwards. Mother stayed with her until around 4:00 p.m. Shot was around 12:30 p.m. She went to sleep when she got back to her dorm and missed evening class. She has not noted any other side effects other than the tiredness, but she is a college student that&#39;s known to have low iron, was on her period, that just went through a trauma event that probably would have jumped her adrenaline, and she was giving some liquid Benadryl. I&#39;m sure any one of those could keep the fatigue.  There was a call put into the doctor but she&#39;s procrastinating on getting back to them. No rash or difficulty breathing was noticed.

                                                Patient was given her first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Patient had stated that she had felt lightheaded when she was given 4 vaccines at one time in the past. We advised patient to remain seated for 15 minutes for monitoring. Patient felt more comfortable standing next to her seated sister, who had also received the vaccine. The sister said the patient had told her she started feeling lightheaded and walked over to sit down on the other chair. Once seated, per the sister, the patient slumped to the floor and started shaking. At this point, we were alerted, but after a few seconds, the shaking had stopped and the patient was fully alert. The patient was unaware of what had happened. We called 911 and paramedics came to assess the patient. The patient remained seated on the ground until paramedics arrived. The paramedics assessed her vitals and everything was normal. The paramedics were comfortable with the patient going home with her sister, but upon standing up, the patient felt lightheaded again. At this point, the paramedics thought it would be best for the patient to be monitored at the hospital. The patient agreed to be taken to for further monitoring.

                                                After receiving my second dose, I started to develop mouth ulcers covering the entire inside of my mouth. Throughout the weekend, they continued to develop. I went to the ER to receive pain medication, as the ulcers were so bad that I could not talk or eat. The following morning, I passed out going to pick up my medication at CVS, where I was taken back to the hospital in an ambulance and had a 103 degree fever. I was given IV fluids and was sent on my way. I was on strict bedrest for 4 days, until on Thursday 04/22/2021, I was readmitted to the ER due to worsening of the sores and lack of nutrition. For 3 days since then, I have been on IV fluids, pain medication, and taking a steroid solution to help the ulcers in my mouth lessen. The doctors here believe that it is an extremely strong reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine second dose.

She regained consciousness  after a few seconds and sat down on the floor, she had mild seizure for a few seconds before she regained consciousness. She had no headache and her breathing was normal. She told she has no history of seizures. She told she was feeling fine. But after a few minutes she told she was feeling dizzy again, so we called the paramedics and she was taken to the hospital. I called and left message for patient to follow up with her.

                                                About roughly two weeks after receiving this vaccine I had a migraine. I had never had a migraine before so I went to urgent care, where they told me it would probably go away in a couple of days. It didn&#39;t, and I was having a whole horde of visual symptoms (floaters, flashing lights, photophobia, visual aura) so I went to Mass Eye and Ear ER about a week later. They did an examination of my eyes and told me it was all okay, and most likely due to a migraine. I assumed it would go away once more, but never did, with the symptoms continuing to become more frequent/severe. While the actual migraine part (head hurting to specify) would come and go, my visual symptoms never subsided. And despite MEE saying my vision was actually 20/15, so I could still objectively see fine, it was just not normal. I started to have vertigo, and more visual auras (a plain green line in my vision for a couple of minutes), and with these symptoms going on for about two weeks at this point, I went to an urgent care appointment at MGH, through my doctor. They administered some migraine medication (sumatriptan and zofran), but my visual symptoms did not improve. I was then sent to MGH er. They tested me for a whole myriad of things, as well as administering an MRI/MRA of the brain, and MRI of the spine, as well as performing a spinal tap, none of which yielded any significant findings. Many of my visual symptoms still persist, and the headache part, as well as vertigo, comes and goes. It has been almost a month since receiving the first dose and I am waiting to see if symptoms improve with the second. While it is obviously unclear as to whether this happened due to the vaccine or due to a third unknown factor, considering these symptoms developed roughly around the time you allegedly start to gain a significant immunity to COVID, and that no medical professionals have been able to find a clear reason for them, I feel as though it is possible and likely. (Also, I had previously had COVID, testing positive Jan 18th 2021, if that&#39;s of any relevance).

                                                Symptoms started off Wednesday night around 10pm with itchiness all over the body (didn?t think any of it). Thursday morning, the itchiness had ?spread? to my neck (main itch spot) and I saw a nurse practitioner to help out (prescribed benadryl and cortisone which didn?t work). Friday morning, the itchiness is still there and it?s getting annoying at this point. Saw another doctor who prescribed benadryl at night and Loratadine in the morning/afternoon, as well as colloidal oatmeal baths, new detergent and shampoo, dove unscented soap, and caladryl (did not help at all). Friday night, both arms and hands were feeling numb and tingly. Went to the ER saw a PA and he prescribed Benadryl 25mg, Pepcid 20mg, and steroids 60mg (Med....Prednisol ???) Kept up with the prescription on Saturday 25mg of Benadryl, 20mg of Pepcid and started of the 21pill package of steroids (6pills on the first day, each 4mg, and tapering off 1 pill per day for 6 days). The treatment didn?t work. The itchiness and discomfort is still very much apparent. Tuesday (05/04) afternoon I saw a primary care doctor, explained the symptoms and treatments. She believes it has something to do with the vaccine and described my symptoms to be similar to that of ?dermatographia?.  I don?t have a history of allergies or allergic reactions and the only skin ?problem? I?ve ever had is acne. No pre-existing medical conditions that could ?trigger? this

That night I started noticing some discomfort in my genital area so the following day I examined myself and saw I had genital ulcers on my vulva area. This caused Severe pain when walking. Since it was the weekend, my OBGYN was closed so I went to urgent care and the doctor thought it was BV and prescribed me medication for it, but according to my OBGYN when I went to visit her on Monday, she said it was not BV. My OBGYN tested me for herpes since she said it looked like herpes, but that came out negative but she still prescribed me herpes medication to help with the pain and ulcers. The ulcers lasted for about a week.

                                                04/26/2021 got the shot. An hour later, I had shortness of breath. Kept persisting throughout the week and worsened. On sunday, 05/02/2021 between the hours of 12AM to 2AM, my shortness of breath got worse to the point where I could not breathe. In general, I felt my back and chest tighten. I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I&#39;d wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.  Eventually I got up to go to work around 8AM, the right side of my body wasn&#39;t as numb and the breathing wasn&#39;t as bad, but you could still tell there was an issue. This issue persisted throughout the day. As of now, these issues are not as persistent, but at least once a day, I still feel the effect. It sucks. A nurse called me (working at the urgent care I gave information about) , on 05/03/2021 saying if I was going to see a primary doctor. I told her that I have an appointment with one on 05/10/2021.  She said that though they called me on 05/02/2021 towards the end of the day and told me everything was fine, that they looked a little deeper and realized that the shape of my cells were weird and that when I go to my primary doctor, they&#39;d be able to access my information.  This is of a complete shock because the shape of my cells were never weird before. This happened as a result of the covid-19 vaccine. This is reaction must be put into the VAERS system.

She temporarily lost vision in both eyes as well as her hearing. She became cold to the touch, red, and clammy. Patient reported feeling like she was feeling like she was blacking out. We had given her water, wiped her off with towels, and fanned her. 911 was called at this point and her blood pressure was checked which showed 122/91mmHg. Management came over to the pharmacy and was helping fan her as well. The fire dept and EMTs showed up soon after and took over. Patient?s hearing and vision were restored and started feeling back to normal. Patient then declined further medical intervention from EMT?s and went home.

Asked if it was done without realizing vaccine was complete. Pt was sturdy upon standing and said she felt well. She made it to the chair in the designated area in front of the pharmacy. Approximately 3-5 minutes later patient raised her arm to get the attention of the staff. Said she felt funny. Vaccinating pharmacist went out to determine what was wrong. Patient said she felt faint and dizzy as well as felt nauseous. Patient spit up clear saliva inbetween dry heaving. We were able to give her paper towels and some water after her episode of spitting up. Approximately 5 to 7 minutes later she said she felt better but still had some faintness and a tingling sensation in her arms and fingers. Had patient stay for 20 minutes after she said she was feeling better. No more shaking, nausea, or faintness. She felt her normal self after the 20 minutes and her mother was with her to drive her home. Explained to patient that VAERS report would be submitted.

Within 10 minutes, my face had swollen up, my eyes were swollen and red, and my hands, feet and chest had hives.   Paramedics were called and arrived 5 minutes later. At this time I was barely able to walk, was still vomiting and having diarrhea, and was shaking. They put me in the ambulance and took me to a 24hr emergency clinic.   In the ambulance, I was given saline, epinephrine, Benadryl and nausea meds. I stayed under observation until 3 am. I was released to go home at that time. Since then I have only experienced weakness and nausea.

                                                After receiving shot (2nd Moderna COVID-19), almost immediately patient complained of dizziness. Patient then lost all bodily control, almost felt off vaccination chair. Patient appears pale and lost consciousness. Patient was then slowly helped to the ground then all of a sudden patient started to have involuntary muscular twitching almost like she was having a seizure. Immediately I asked to call for paramedic. A waiting patient, who is a law enforcement officer assisted to help patient the floor. Then unpredictably patient sat quickly up and regained consciousness and appeared confused like she had no memory what had just happen. Paramedics did not come as patient had quickly felt better and was able to communicate proficiently. Her breathing was normal. No dizziness reported after. Patient was moved to waiting area and sat down in chair and I took her blood pressure. Blood pressure was normal 112/72. Requested patient to wait for a total of 30 minutes for monitoring. Blood pressure retaken after 10 minutes normal again . Patient was able to walk away by herself without assistance.  I gave patient a call for a well being check at 3pm today and patient insisted she feels normal. Encourage patient to be evaluated by her primary care provider.

I can still function, but when something touches my skin, there is not the sensation that there used to be. I feel the pressure and temperature, but it is otherwise numb. I am able to squeeze or pinch myself very hard and not feel it/barely feel it, now. I have also lost a lot of my sense of taste.

                                                I got my depo shot a week and a day after I got my 2nd dose of the vaccine. Shortly after I was driving home and I felt like there was an elephant sitting on my chest. I couldn?t get my air in I was freaking out. I drove home  and was so weak walking into my house I thought I was going to pass out. I told my mom I think I need to go to the hospital. I sat down. Ate some food and tried to relax. It eventually went away and I started getting ready to go to school. Just as I was getting ready to leave I got a huge migraine and started feeling really shakey. That?s when I decided to go to the doctors. They made me take some bloodwork, EKG, X-ray. They suspected from my white blood count that I might have a blood clot so they ordered an emergency cat scan. I got one done and they told me no blood clot. Then today I came in for more bloodwork and they told me that some of my waves from my EKG were slightly abnormal which meant I wasn?t getting enough oxygen into my heart. They want me to take an echo which in that they put me out and shove a scope down my throat and look at my heart. They think it was a reaction from taking my depo so soon after my covid vaccine.

                                                Patient was sitting in the post vaccination monitoring area after her 2nd dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on May 12. She was with her brother and another male. Pt came up to the hostess to let her know the patient was having a seizure. I was called to the waiting area. The patient was sitting with head hung down and hands were moving involuntarily. She was not responding  when calling her name. Her brother informed me that she does this at times and has a somatic seizure disorder. I asked how I could help and he asked that we get her outside in the fresh air. Got a wheel chair and by the time we started to put her in the wheel chair she was becoming more awake. We took her outside and she was more awake but tired. She told me that she did not do this with her 1st COVID vaccine but she has done after other vaccines.

That passed and I started getting really dizzy and was unable to hear or see anything. I pulled over and my throat started to close up and I was having a hard time breathing. It passed in about 2 minutes and an hour later I felt fine but my brain felt tingly like I was on the verge of passing out but no other side effects.  My brain still feels tingly as well.

                                                My daughter started to experience headaches 2 days after her first dose. On May 13th the headache had become so bad that she would cry and then suddenly became unable to speak or grab. She could not formulate actual words and was unable to smile . This lasted 15 minutes. A trip to the nearest Emergency room was inconclusive and resulted in discharge. 24 hours later , we had the same incident only this time magnified times 10. Where she remained in a catatonic like state for 7 hours only to snap out of it independently without medical treatment. After multiple test she was diagnosed with viral encephalitis. All major causes of encephalittis were ruled out and we were told it was possible a side affect of her first Moderna Covid Vaccine dose. We are still seeing doctors and testing but she seems to have improved without medication which is even more alarming .

Pharmacist went to the patient and instructed the staff to call 911.  Patient&#39;s mother (who is a RN) stated that the patient fainted and had a seizure.  Patient&#39;s mother stated the patient had a history of seizures (although on the consent form they marked no history).  Patient was conscious and had a pulse, she could talk - but she was very slow and labored in speech.  After a few minutes patient regained color in her face and was able to speak &#34;normally&#34;.  At that time the patient stated that she had a history of seizures and that her last seizure was 2 years ago.  Patient also stated that her seizure triggers were fear and pain and that after the first shot she did experience dizziness (but had not told anyone about that).  Pharmacist stayed with the patient until EMS arrived, EMS took over care and took the patient to a local hospital for evaluation.

She said she had no trouble breathing, swallowing fluids or any chest pain. It was recommended to take 2 benadryl tablets now (4:45pm) and 2 tablets before she goes to bed. I had the father get on the phone as well, tell educate him on monitoring her breathing. She was urged to see a doctor or call 911 if breathing issues start or swelling gets worse. I asked her to call the store first thing tomorrow morning when we open to see if there was any relief from the benadryl or if symptoms got worse.

Her mother screamed for us, so we rushed out and had a tech call ED.  When we went out there, she was hunched over forward as her mother was holding her.  She appeared to be having a seizure lasting around 10 seconds and was confused when she stopped.  Her mother told us before that happened, her head fell back and her eyes were rolled back.  Later, the patient told us she was just having a panic attack.  The paramedics arrived and checked her out.  All seemed to be fine, with the exception of a fast heartbeat as expected.  They convinced her to go to the hospital to be checked out.  I will follow-up with her mother this evening.

                                                On May 5th, 2021 at 10:45 am I experienced severe dizziness and faintness. I was unable to ride from a laying position without passing out. When I would try to sit up my heart rate would go from the low 60s to 120-130 before I would faint. This condition was persistent for 4 hours and my parents made the decision for me to go to the emergency room.  At the Er they administered fluids and observed me for about 4 hours and then sent me home because I could stand and walk. They also determined that I was somewhat anemic, my hemoglobin was 9.6.   In the weeks following these visits I had a number of episodes these episodes including symptoms of heart palpitations, tingly hands, and feet, mouth, and chin going numb,  feeling faint and dizzy eyes, and other visual disturbances. One of these episodes occurred on June 12th, 2021 while I was driving. I felt heart palpitations, tingly hands, and feet, face and chin going numb and feeling faint. I pulled over which happened to be in a parking lot where there was an Er. I went in and got evaluated. They ran an EKG but felt they did not catch whatever the episode was so they prescribed me a portable heart monitor. Which I wore for 14 days and am now waiting for the results.

                                                Patient received her second COVID vaccine (Moderna) on 06/21/21. She says 12 hours after her vaccine she developed nausea, vomiting, and low grade fever. The vomiting became persistent and patient developed severe flank pain. She was taken to an ER. 24 hours post vaccine. Patient says she was given IV boluses and Zofran which helped resolve the vomiting, she was discharged later the same day. Her fever lasted 4-5 days, t-max 100.0 with intermittent Tylenol dosing. Since discharge she says she continues to have consistent nausea but denies vomiting. She admits she has little appetite and has not felt hungry. She denies diarrhea. Her flank pain is &#34;constant&#34; and she felt it was starting to effect her bladder. Patient denies burning and stinging; however, describes back pain prior to voiding. She says she does not feel she can fully empty her bladder despite having urgency to do so. She denies gross hematuria. She says she does not feel well in general and has no energy. She feels her flank pain is becoming worse and Tylenol is no longer giving her relief. Her brother says the family wanted to ensure there was no complications involving her kidneys considering her history.  The renal team did not feel patients symptoms were related to a kidney/bladder issue but rather a reaction to her second COVID vaccine. Her case was discussed with rheumatology and infectious disease. She received ondansetron for nausea, Naproxen for pain, and encouraged her to remain well hydrated. She was  prescribed a short course of prednisone.

                                                A few days after getting my second dose, I started to develop a numb and sharp pain in my upper back . It started in the right but usually goes to the left side of my back too. It?s a pinching feeling too. When i wake up, there?s a painful pinch in my back.

                                                I took my daughter to ER twice on July 7th and July 11th and she has been in the hospital ever since.  They suspect GBS.  She can?t walk, has extreme pain, and is struggling to understand what is happening to her.  She was a healthy 19 year old woman jumping on a trampoline and enjoying her life as we hiked through the park just 2 weeks ago.   Now she can not walk, has 80% paralysis and has pain that makes her cry constantly. As a reference she is a tough woman - she had her wisdom teeth removed and never used the pain medication they sent home with her.  She is in the hospital with no clear path back to a normal life and all of the doctors implied that the most logical cause is the vaccine.  She has insurance for the moment (through me)  but she can?t work and my insurance may not renew.  This will destroy her (and possibly me) financially if there is no help.

                                                My fever was through the roof. My body ached so bad I couldn?t walk. I was on fire all over. Then came the adverse event- uncontrollable shaking. This was not a side effect written on the moderna sheet of risks. I was shaking so bad I thought I may have a seizure. I finally settled down and fell asleep. About an hour later, I woke up shaking out of control. I was going to call 911 but my partner was able to grab some NyQuil for me and knocked me out. It was the most terrifying experience of my life and I will not be getting the second shot because of it.

The symptoms started a few hours after I received the vaccine and got significantly worse the next morning. I had to call out of work because I physically felt that my knees would give out when I was standing. I also could not rest my wrists on anything because it caused too much pain. The next day, I felt much better and was able to go to work.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I became extremely dizzy, nauseous, my lips went numb, shortness of breath, weakness, slow reaction times, the inability to operate at my normal speed in thought and action, and I became very lethargic.  I received the vaccine during a shift at work, and I was unable to complete the shift at my normal efficiency or concentration. To my coworkers, I described the feeling as being intoxicated, but not slurring my words. This feeling decreased enough by 9pm where I felt safe to drive home, but it was not completely gone until  approximately 11pm.

I started to sweat but had no fever at the time. This continued all night. I had no appetite after receiving my vaccine. Around 6:30 I started to get a fever of 100.3 and continued chills with headaches. I took Tylenol when needed. My whole body was sore throughout the day and got worse are the night progressed. My fever was in and out but around 9pm I had the highest temp of 101.4. I didn&#39;t get good sleep due to feeling unwell all night. I belive I stared feeling more myself sometime around 9:34am. But was still feeling a bit warm. But felt way better as the day progressed. My left arm where I received my shot is still very sore. And I still don&#39;t have an appetite.

On 3/12/21, she started feeling jaw pain on same side of injection and shoulder pain intensified plus numbness.  Patient says the pain and numbness  comes and goes. She is due for her next  dose on Saturday, March 28 but decided to wait  a little bit longer before she gets her second dose.

I sat with her for about 30 to 40 minutes to make sure she was maintaining normal breathing.  She did take some oral Diphenhydramine as was very itchy and red. She did have friend with her and we instructed her to go to ER if got worse.  Next day 3/24/21 patient called and said she had a productive cough and was advised by staff pharmacist to go to Dr.  She called back and said did go to Dr. and was prescribed steroids and antihistamine (was on steroid at time of vaccination but we were unaware) and Dr told patient not to get 2nd vaccination. Patient was doing better but not completely recovered

When I woke up the next morning I was short of breath and it felt like there was a lot of pressure on your chest. I called the hospital that gave me the vaccine and they recommended I go to the ER. I was discharged after 3 hours. I still felt short of breath and had the feeling of pressure on my chest for 48-56 hours. It just got better gradually. I was unable to work because I felt bad and because I also had to quarantine until my test results came back negative for Covid-19.

This was discussed with Dr., and he instructed us to go ahead with vaccination.  We had the patient lie down during and after vaccination, and she was under observation.  Her father was with her in the room.  Her seizure lasted less than 2 minutes, and she was then evaluated by Dr.. She was dismissed in stable condition, with instructions to follow up with her neurologist.

                                                Later Thursday night, I started to get headache, chills, fever and nausea. This continued all throughout the night and into Friday. The headache was so bad, anytime I moved, it seemed like someone was stabbing my head right in the front. I was hot due to the fever but I never got the temperature. The chills were dramatic, as I was laying on the floor shaking like it was -10 degrees while it was room temperature. I never threw up, but it was hard to drink anything. I couldn?t sleep that night as I was shaking so bad and the head ache hurt. Friday was the same, if Thursday night was a 10, Friday was a 9, so it got some what better. I had to drive and did so with out accidents, but it was t the smartest idea. Couldn?t eat Friday night, but I didn?t throw up. Saturday, everything is almost back to normal, headache is minor, no fever and little nausea, but the first 30 ish hours were the absolute worst in my life.

I tried taking some acetaminophen to help with the swelling and soreness, but it didn?t change. Icing it helped with the swelling.

                                                Exactly eight days after taking the vaccine my arm became really sore again and the lymph nodes under my arm swelled up and are painful to the touch. I have a rash on my arm like a red welt, but it does not itch, it is just sore.  On the affected arm my hand shakes and it feels weaker than my other arm.

I had one of her friends help me place her on the floor with her feet up in the chair and I noticed she felt hot.  I called for a technician to bring me a cold pack and placed it on her forehead.  I asked her friends if she had eaten today and they said she skipped breakfast and only had a bagel for lunch.  After a minute or 2 on her back, she began to revive  and when she felt up to it, I had her sit up on the floor and gave her some water to sip.  After a few more minutes, she said she felt good enough to sit up in the chair, so we helped her get up and put her in the chair.  She stayed around for about 30 minutes after that and was feeling better and left

                                                Fever started at 11:30pm 4/6/2021. Fever ~100 degrees F. Had chills and couldn&#39;t get warm, then was hot and drenched in sweat. Repeated all throughout the night (Hot/cold). Took 500mg Tylenol at 12am that night. Woke up at 2am with a ~102.4 F fever. Took another Tylenol. Got out of bed around 8am 4/7 drenched in sweat. Felt nauseous and vomited almost right away and couldn&#39;t stop for a few minutes. Still had around 102 F so took 2 more Tylenols. Throughout that night and until Friday, I was achy all over my body. Also, lymph node under left arm pit was swollen and was sore along with my left arm. Throughout the day on 4/7, laid in bed trying to get rest and too nauseous to eat anything other than some cereal in the morning and plain noodles later in the day. Took another Tylenol in the afternoon because I was still staying at 102 F fever. Was slightly dizzy when standing up or moving too fast. I slept the next night and felt fine 4/8 morning (no fever), but felt worse as the day went on, aching everywhere and feeling more and more dizzy. Friday 4/9, I woke up in the morning and when I first started walking, I fell on the floor because of extreme dizziness. The whole day I was extremely dizzy and I&#39;ve never had vertigo before, but it seemed like that based on explanations of it. Also had painful headache every time I stood up, but was fine when I wasn&#39;t moving. The next day it was mild dizziness and completely gone the day after that.  Also, Thursday 4/8 around 7:30pm, I noticed I had hives on the back of my right hand. Not 100% sure if it&#39;s due to the vaccine, but I&#39;m not sure what else would have caused it and it&#39;s worth noting. It was gone the next day.

                                                Patient felt faint 10 min after receiving vaccination. She said she felt as though she had been hit by a truck and was very hot. She was sat down and feet propped up. Cold compress was placed on the back of her neck. She stated that she had not eaten anything today so we gave her something to drink in case her sugar was low. After a few minutes she stated her throat felt strange. I asked her if she felt like it was tightening  or lips or tongue swelling or issues with breathing. She stated she didn&#39;t know about the throat other than it felt strange. I gave her 25mg of Benadryl after getting permission from her just in case an allergic reaction was starting. She stated soon after that her throat was getting better. She sat for about 45 minutes in our immunization room until she felt better. She was no longer hot and feeling bad when leaving.

When she came to, she said she felt &#34;weird&#34;,  lightheaded and clammy.  We offered her a drink of water and before she could take a drink, she passed out cold. She was out for about 20 seconds and then came to again and we took her down to 1 layer on top and gave her a bag of ice while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.  She was treated/observed by the ambulance crew and after another 15 minutes, agreed she was good to go home with her 2 friends that she had ridden with to get her vaccine.

                                                Around 11:00 in the morning I was starting to feel weak and hard of breathing with a sore arm where the injection site was. As the day went on it progressed to muscle aches and a low fever, I went to bed with chills, muscle pain, heavy breathing, and a 100.8 fever. I work up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and felt nauseous, I don?t remember much but I remember waking up on the floor in a cold sweat, so I assume I passed out from the nausea. I went back to bed and I woke up with a 101.8 fever and weakness and muscle pains. My mother told me to take Tylenol every 4 hours and be on top of things, my symptoms have been decreasing since this morning but as I am filling this out at 11:00 at night I?m slowly getting my fever back. I will add this is exactly how I felt when I got covid back in November of 2020.

                                                Seven hours after receiving my second dose, I developed flu-like symptoms--fever of 100-101 degrees, full body aches, fatigue, and chills, in addition to a sore left arm. These symptoms continued for 18 hours. It was difficult to sleep.  I had the flu three years ago but this felt more severe. Symptoms were treated first with 200mg ibuprofen with no response and then with Tylenol, which improved symptoms.  I stayed in bed for most of those 18 hours to rest. Two days after receiving my second dose, I had a headache for the whole day.  The headache then became a migraine. Both treated with aspirin. Three days after the second dose, I felt fatigued, weak, and still had a headache. To my understanding, the first two days of ailment reflect my body&#39;s immune response and the final two are typical of my body&#39;s stress response. However, I have not experienced either in response to a vaccine.   I should also mention my first menstrual cycle after receiving the first dose of the vaccine was shorter than usual. My periods are not always regular so it may be a coincidence, not causation.

                                                Patient was given her first dose of Moderna at a drive through clinic and instructed to wait the 15 minutes for observation.  During this time patient and her mother notified the staff member that patient was not feeling including feeling dizzy and nauseated and feeling abdominal discomfort with numbness and tingling of her tongue and lips.  RN  assessed patient and took vitals. Patient was alert and oriented and able to speak in full sentences,  denied SOB, chest pain and was breathing comfortably.  BP was 80/40 HR 50&#39;s, RR 18. The PA at the clinic where the clinic was being held assessed patient and assessed lung sounds which were clear and the patient then reported feeling &#34;a lot better&#34;.  Color returned to her lips and face.  Patient was asked to stay on-site for continued observation before leaving. Approximately 10 minutes later patient asked to use the bathroom in our clinic.  She was advised she could go as long as her Mom was allowed to go in with her in case she experienced dizziness or needed help.   After 5-10 minutes the patient was still in the bathroom. RN who worked inside clinic checked on patient who reported diarrhea more dizziness and weakness.  After discussion with the provider it was  and patient&#39;s mother it was decided that the mother would drive the patient to the nearest emergency room although this patient is a (Name) patient, for further and continued assessment.  At this time the patient was speaking in full sentences able to walk and and did not report any breathing problems.  After helping patient back to her vehicle RN called ER to give report to the charge nurse.

I had muscle aches through my entire body. It is now 2 days after the day I got the vaccine and my arm is still sore and hurt when I extend my arm.

                                                About 15 minutes after the patient had the shot, she said her hands were shaky. I asked her to sit a little longer and I offered her some water. About 5 mins later I asked how she was feeling and she said she still felt shaky and thought her hands felt numb. I asked her to continue to sit down and relax. I quickly called our local EMT paramedic service. About 5 minutes later, 2 paramedics showed up, spoke to her, and took her to their mobile service. I called the patient on the next day i.e. 4/25/21 and spoke to her father, who had brought her in for her shot the previous day. He said the paramedics said her blood pressure and oxygen saturation were fine, so they opted to go home instead of to the ER. He said she was doing better at home on 4/25 but still had some cold and flu like symptoms. I asked him to keep us updated and to also inform her primary care provider, so that a decision can be made whether she should continue the Moderna vaccine series or otherwise.

                                                After first vaccine: History: Moderna COVID vaccine on 3/11/2021. Arm soreness over the first day or two but nothing else that really struck her. A few days after she started to notice axillary pain that progressed up her right neck and down to her right hand. She saw a physician who thought she was having nerve pain brought on by the vaccine. Around the 18th she started to feel a snapping pain in her wrist. Went to ED on the 20th because she started to have arm shaking, she was given ativan, her arm shaking stopped and they discharged her home. That evening her fingers felt clenched. On the 21st she woke up in the morning, went to urinate and dropped to the floor because her legs felt like jello and felt like they kept giving out. They initially thought the ativan was just making her feel out of it. They waited until the evening but then needed to go to the ED. The concern was GBS and transverse myelitis. They ate dinner and decided to drive to ED, on the drive she was kind of falling asleep periodically. Then she suddenly couldn&#39;t lift her water bottle. She started to be completely out of it, Mom says she wasn&#39;t responding. Pt says that she felt like she knew what was going on, felt a little out of body and wasn&#39;t quite responding. Mom couldn&#39;t get her out of the car, she was carried into the ED and at that point she started to recover a little bit more. About 10 minutes later she started to feel better. She was admitted because she was still having trouble walking. In the hospital she had a normal CT head and video EEG but she didn&#39;t have any events while on the monitor. Discharged home the following day with the diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder and instructions to establish care with an adult PCP. They advised considering CBT as well.  Since discharge her legs feels tired, going up the stairs feels much harder than it should. She has not had any falls and no longer feels like she is going to fall.  She follows with a therapist, has had dissociative episodes and panic attacks in the past.   Assessment:  20 YOF with PMH of panic attack, POTS, IDA and benign heart murmur who developed weakness of b/l LE and altered consciousness approximately 10 days after her first dose of Moderna COVID vaccine. Also had an episode of unilateral arm shaking the day prior that resolved with ativan in the ED. At this point unclear if directly related to vaccination. Differential includes mild Guillain-Barre 2/2 previous infection or vaccination, stress reaction/anxiety, POTS complication, myasthenia gravis, tick bite, infection, heavy metal poisoning, B12 deficiency, seizure disorder, atypical migraine. Functional Neurologic Disorder diagnosed by neurology after overnight admission  for video EEG which captured no events. CT head  also WNL per neurology discharge summary. Neurologic exam today WNL.   After Second Vaccine: History: She had her 2nd vaccine on 4/15 (6 days ago). Had vaccine in right arm again, she did have some arm pain again. She had coffee without breakfast in the morning. Had finished her first virtual class, went to the restroom during her second class, felt strangely in the restroom, went back to her room. She then passed out. Her fall was unwitnessed. She called to her roommate when she came to but her roommate hadn&#39;t heard the fall. She thinks she was only out for a few seconds but cannot be sure. Called her Mom who advised her to eat something so she ate an orange sitting on the floor. She got up to make herself breakfast and she passed out again. Again unwitnessed but patient thinks it was very fast. She crawled over to the couch, sat on the couch for for 15 minutes then felt fine for the rest of the day. She did not feel nauseous at all. She denies palpitations, difficulty breathing and chest pain.  Today in office after orthostatics and blood draw she fainted again, only out for seconds. BP elevated immediately after the event but WNL minutes later.  These syncopal episodes reminded her of her syncopal episodes with IDA and POTS. They do not feel like the episode after the first vaccine when she lost feeling in her legs and was very out of it.  She feels like her arm pain from the first vaccine never fully resolved. After the arm pain worsened from the 2nd shot she tried a 3 day course of aleve to see if that helped things. At this point it is mostly just her right wrist that is painful. Overall feels more localized to wrist than prior. She has since stopped the aleve, last was last night. She has not noticed redness or swelling in wrist or arm.  LMP was 4/2-4/6. She went almost a year without menses so stopped her OCP, but her menses have returned recently and she has restarted OCP.  Assessment: Right arm pain persisted from the first vaccination but otherwise sx had resolved. She got 2nd vaccination on 4/15, only arm pain but yesterday had 2 brief syncopal events and one today in the office. Orthostatic BPs not completely convincing for orthostatic hypotension today.

                                                Approximately ten hours after injection, woke up with constant chills, fever of 100.1, body aches, stuffed nose (had to breathe out of mouth), and headache. Acetaminophen helped slightly. For the next 12 hours fever stayed between 101 and 102 despite continuing to take acetaminophen, and headache also didn&#39;t improve. At 6:15 pm that day (~29 hours post-shot) fever was 103.2, headache was very strong (with light sensitivity). Since acetaminophen hadn&#39;t been helping, switched to ibuprofen. About an hour later, the fever finally began to go down and was gone by 10 pm that night. The next day, no fever and minimal headache, but was very weak and lightheaded. At about 51 hours after the shot, symptoms were all gone.

Pain was so extreme that the arm was immobilized- any movement no matter how small caused pain to flare. It felt like a broken bone. Injection at 2:30pm, pain peaked around 10pm. Next morning awoke with same extreme pain and added severe body aches in lower back and legs along with a headache. Pain persists as of report

Pt stated her throat felt &#34;much better&#34;. EMS was called at 1727 when Epi was administered. Pt called her mother to notify her of situation. Pt also called father and he did not want pt assessed by EMS or taken to hospital in ambulance. When EMS arrived, father was not present and pt did not refuse treatment, so they did perform an assessment. After that, pt refused tx and continued to feel &#34;well&#34; with no other complaints other than &#34;shakiness&#34;, which is a common side-effect of epinephrine. EMS left and pt&#39;s father arrived. Pt was able to sit and stand on her own. Before she left, she complained of &#34;tightening&#34; and &#34;tingling&#34; again in her throat. Told her she should receive another epipen. Pt&#39;s father said he had one in the car and that he would give it to her and drive her to the hospital.  Pt nodded in understanding. Pt vitals taken at 1750, BP 162/84, HR 113, O2 99%.

She was instructed to sit in the waiting room for about 15 minutes with her boyfriend. About five minutes after sitting out in the waiting room, the patient almost passed out and had some convulsive like movements. 911 was called. The patient did not loose consciousness, but was extremely pale. She was nausea and almost vomited three times. She reported feeling shaky, and said her throat felt funny. EMS arrived and took over the care of the patient.

I also had cramps like period cramps as if my lungs dropped to my pelvic.

                                                On 5/17/21 the Patient received the Moderna Covid Vaccine. She presented with a known allergy to PCN and Augmentin. This was not a reason for the patient not to get her vaccine today so Pharmacist proceeded to give her the shot. We asked for the patient to sit down and since she had some allergies we asked for her to wait for 30 min. Roughly ten minutes into her wait the patient started to complain of numbness of the face, so we went ahead and gave her a cold bottle of water. About two minutes later the patient began to complain of numbness in the arm along with hives on both arms and neck. At this point the patient looked very flush, disorientated, and acted as if she was going to pass out. I went and sat down with her and I could tell she was uncomfortable for which I got her some ice packs and started asking more questions about her reaction. I could tell the patient was very disorientated and she began to complain of swelling and tightness of the throat.  Once the patient began to complain of throat swelling/tightness. I had call code white and 911 due to the concern of anaphylaxis and pharmacy protocol.

The person who administered the 2nd shot seemed to have injected it way too fast, I noticed a burning sensation as it was injected, and I also noticed that when the needle was removed, the medicine was dripping down arm. A few hours after receiving my shot (5:30 pm), I started to notice a bad headache, feelings of exhaustion, nausea, and hot flashes. I checked my temperature and it was 99.6 degrees, which is higher than I normally run so my body was doing something. I noticed a hard, swollen, red bump at the injection sight on my right arm - which has progressively gotten worse as the days have gone by. I still have the low grade fever, exhaustion, headache, nausea, and swollen/sore arm.

                                                Patient came in for her 2nd Moderna vaccine shot. She had had a similar reaction after her first shot which was also reported to VAERS. She said her first shot reaction lasted until that evening but she was fine the next day and willing to get the 2nd shot. We administered the shot and asked her to wait for 30 mins for observation, because of her history. After 30 mins, we checked on her and she said her arm felt a little numb. We called our local EMS service and they came to check on her. They allowed her to go home after checking on her. I called and spoke to the patients mom/caregiver a couple of hours later. She said the patient was doing better and felt a little worn out. She also mentioned that the patient had a headache, for which I recommended some tylenol.

                                                Within five minutes of administering the vaccine, involuntary movements in the mouth began and then involuntary movements began throughout the body, such as seizures. Involuntary movements throughout the body were every 30 to 40 seconds. She was taken to the emergency room. They tested and administered medications for allergies and keeping the airways open. She was transferred to the emergency room of another hospital for neurological tests. In the hospital they performed EKG, CBS, CT and neurological physical examination. All the results came out fine, except for the low phosphorous. Involuntary movements continued throughout. They release her from the hospital. Involuntary movements continue, return in 24 hours to the emergency room. They performed an EKG because it indicated that he was having chest pain. Turning out well. They discharge her but she continues with the involuntary movements. Four days later she managed to get a doctor to see her, who is her neurologist. The doctor advises that it could be non-epileptic seizures or some conversion. Zoloft and klonopin recipe. Continue with the involuntary movements. All day sharpening at bedtime. Seven days later in conversation with the doctor he refers to an epileptologist and sleep specialist for tests. Nine days later, an EGG of 24 was performed to coordinate a hospitalization. Although the movements today are more sporadic, they continue without explaination.

                                                Seizure; This case was received via VAERS (Reference number: 1151220) on 01-Jun-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 01-Jun-2021.    This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of SEIZURE (Seizure) in a 20-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 027B21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 31-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (Seizure) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, SEIZURE (Seizure) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   There was no treatment medication reported. There was no concomitant medication reported.  The patient had a seizure about 10 minutes after the vaccine was given.  She had reported to us ahead of time that she has a seizure disorder.  Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s underlying condition of seizure disorder remains a confounder. Further information can&#39;t be requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.

                                                Vaccinated Tuesday  07/06/2021 at 12:00pm. At 12:15 I was having palpitations, and my throat felt tight, I attribute this to anxiety, I was nervous to get the shot but think it should still be noted. At 1:00 or 2:00 that afternoon, I noticed about an inch around where the shot was injected I had small white head like bumps, that if scratched or pressured drained white puss. At 3:00pm that afternoon, I stood up from my bed and felt pressure in my head similar to sinus pressure you can get from a cold. I had no congestion.   On Wednesday 07/07/2021 I woke up and my upper L arm was in significant pain. The area that was vaccinated had a 2-3 inch radius that was bright red in color. The area where I was injected had a 0.5-1 inch radius that was dark purple. This area was hot to the touch, firm, and swollen. The pain was constant but worse when touched.    On Thursday 07/08/2021 there was no new symptoms and the skin reaction started to go away but was still present.   Today Friday 07/09/2021 the skin reaction is still present but improved.  It is still painful to the touch. The redness is gone but the dark purple circle is still pressent. It is still slightly firm, and is no longer hot to touch. It is still slightly painful to touch but not bothersome when left alone. Today I had to leave work early due to a drop in blood pressure at 12:00pm. Around 10-11am I was standing and typing when I felt like I had come down with the flu. This happened rapidly within 2 minutes. I felt feverish, I was sweating, I felt nauseous, but I did not vommit, I felt as though I was going to faint. I had one of the nurses at my workplace check my blood pressure. It was 107/72. Within an hour it rose to 108/72 so I decided to go home.  It should be noted I do not normally eat breakfast. I stay well hydrated.  I had only had my medication, and water at the time of this event which is normal for me. I was given crackers, and juice that did not help. I am unsure if this is related to the vaccination but think it should be noted.

                                                The effects began with pain and inflammation in my right foot on July 4th. The pain and inflammation later escalated to my right arm, and thus I could not move them much. I visited a clinic on July 6th to no avail, and was referred to the hospital for testing. I visited a Medical Center on July 8th and received blood tests, x-rays, and ultrasounds. The tests all came back clear. I was prescribed naproxen for the inflammation. The next day, July 9th, my left foot was then inflamed and painful. I visited another physician on July 13th for a second opinion, and was prescribed furosemide as they had told me I had edema in my feet. On the evening of July 14th, I had begun to get a sharp pain in my right hip and thigh. The pain soon escalated well into midnight (July 15), and at that point, I could no longer move without a shooting pain that was unbearable. I visited the Hospital the same day, and again received multiple tests, including blood, ultrasound, and x-rays. I was there until the next day, and was given an anti-inflammatory shot, and was told to continue to take the naproxen for the rest of the dosage. As of today, July 29th, my swelling and pain have mostly gone down in my feet and arm, but I continue to have flare-ups of pain in the joints, and I now have pain and inflammation in my right knee. Any sort of joint inflammation was rare for me before I was vaccinated.

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

I took 3 tablets of 200 mg Ibuprofen in the morning. Then, I went to work where I felt nauseous and a headache and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen. I went to bed feeling better and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen before bed. I now feel a lot better, just a sore arm!

                                                On 12/31/2020 I had a headache and I was tired.  Over then next two days my arm was very sore.  That subsided by 1/02/21.  On 1/07/21 I woke up around 8 AM with my arm being sore again and at ejection site I had a red circle. The ejection site was also swollen. I took a benedryl and the pain subsided but the red circle continued to grow.  On 1/08/21 the circle got even bigger (even with taking two 25 mg tablets of benedryl before bed) and it?s warm to the touch.    Also on 1/07/2021 at around 6 pm I began menstrual spotting (this would be in the dead middle of my usual cycle). It continued into today ,1/08/2021. This is unusual for me as I have never experienced spotting in the middle of my cycle.   Also on today 1/08/2021 my arm soreness has returned as the red circle is  growing bigger around the ejection site (approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 inches). I?m also experiencing extra tiredness and a headache.

My arm has been red and itchy since the day, but it is increasing becoming warmed, bigger, and itchier every day since.

This headache went away when I woke up the following day.  On Saturday, January 9 I experienced chills, nausea, body aches, and a stiff neck, along with pain in my left arm. The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

I had had a sore arm all day which I expected, but after trying to sleep it off I woke up around 2am shivering and sweating through my shirt at the same time, and had a 98.7 temperature (normally I am 97.2 so that&#39;s high for me). My arm started to have some swelling at the site, but I woke up this morning and the fever, chills, and nausea are still very much present about 24 hours after receiving the first dose.

I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

                                                The first two days after injection it was painful to lift arm above 30 degrees and hurt upon palpation and I had an overall tiredness. A week after the injection on 1/13/2021 I developed a raised, red rash surrounding the injection site (2in x 4 in). The skin that was inflamed was 101.2 degrees fahrenheit.  The intense rash lasted around 24 hours and subsided after 3 treatments of Benadryl cream and one dose of oral Benadryl. The skin is still slightly raised and has a slight redness to it today (1/15/2021) but is much better than before.

I was barely able to speak, calling out for my brothers to get my mom. I was continuing gasping for air while they called an ambulance. The paramedics arrived and checked my lungs and oxygen. By the time they arrived I was back to normal. I didn?t go to the hospital as they didn?t seem it was necessary and I was feeling okay. Later on in the day I just had some slight chest pain and some shortness of breath but it was gone by the end of the night. I?m completely fine now. I had no other symptoms or side effects.

Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

                                                Immediate burning in arm right after receiving shot. 15 minutes after receiving shot began to feel tired and got a headache. Later on in the evening I had discomfort in my chest and had to use my inhaler. Pain in arm worsened over night; couldn&#39;t move arm at all. Pains spread into armpit and back. Got up at 3am to my body shivering, thinking I was running a fever I checked my temperature and it was normal but upon standing I had extreme dizziness to the point of almost passing&#39;s out, I had to sit down right away. Had nausea and whole body felt very sore an achey. The morning after my shot I woke with a headache, extreme pain in my arm and armpit, soreness all over my body, stomach pains, and my heart rate was high. Throughout the day my symptoms got worse I ran a fever of 102.7 which broke but then came back later on in the evening.  The following day my symptoms started to diminish, no fever and body was feeling better, arm pain and headache continued. Now I am on day 4 still experiencing pain in my arm and armpit, slight headache, but chest pains have started. It feels as if there is a brick on my chest, almost like a burning sensation with occasional pains in left breast as well as tightness in the left side of my neck.

I went back into the room and still couldn&#39;t breathe so they sat me down and told me my whole body was bright red and they stuck me with an epipen. The whole reaction probably lasted a  little less than a minute from the time it happened to when they stuck me with the epipen.

It lasted the night, and then I took ibuprofen 200mg in the morning and throughout the day it got better, but around 3pm, it started to come back, so I took another 200mg ibuprofen. I also didn?t eat anything for fear I would throw it up. Later that evening, it got worse and I became extremely fatigued. I was able to eat some soup and crackers. I took another ibuprofen and couldn?t go to sleep until 4am. The next morning I felt better, with only residual side effects. My left arm was also extremely sore and tender from the time of administration until Feb. 6.

                                                After the shot, my arm was swollen for 3 days and a small rash but it went away. Then, on Feb 13th a rash started to reappear that was warm to the touch and itchy and burning. I applied cortisone but rash on injection site kept growing. On Feb 14th, I woke up and rash was a bit smaller but every two hours I would have a tingling sensation like when your foot falls asleep but it went up my shoulder and back area up to my neck and occurred every 2 hours. I then was advised to take claratin, add more cortisone, and take Benadryl as well. The itchiness stoped. My rash is still there but it?s very light compared to feb 13th.

                                                Some of the symptoms that were felt after 3 minutes of getting the Moderna vaccine, I felt dizziness. I couldn&#39;t see anything and I felt a little nauseous in the stomach. I was able to lay down for a couple of minutes and felt fine afterwards. Some of the symptoms going home are a sore arm, can&#39;t seem to lift it up, tired, the vaccine site seems to sting, and some chills.

She felt as if she was having a stroke and that got her more worked up.  She denies lower body weakness.  She states that her head feels heavy and she complains of general fatigue.  No n/v.

The morning after, about 16 hours after the shot, I had severe body aches and pains, a severe headache, fever, chills, and was extremely fatigued with worse pain in the arm at the site of injection (3/13). This lasted until I woke up the next day, about 40 hours after the shot, I felt physically weak the next day and still had arm soreness at the site of injection but no pain, headache, fever, or chills (3/14). Felt completely back to normal, still some slight pain on the arm at the site of injection, about 64 hours after the shot (3/15).

                                                immediately felt sore on site of injection and within minutes of leaving clinic, i felt sharp pain in my upper left back (still have that discomfort and I looked at my back this a.m. and i have a red bruise like mark)  I took advil and laid down, fell asleep and when I tried waking up, I couldn&#39;t wake up and when I did wake, I was breathing hard and disoriented.  I slept with my mom in fear of having episode again. Around 2:45 am, my mom woke to me shaking like I was having a seizure. it lasted about 30 secs. she called 911 and i was checked out by paramedics, who said my vitals were fine and I should flollow up with medical care. My mom and I agreed that perhaps I needed stress dosing of Cortef. I took stress dosage and have been taking stress dosage all day and so far no more episodes.  Now waiting for Doctor to call me back and advise.

Then around 2 am I woke up and vomited. About 20 minutes later I vomited again. The next day I woke up and was fatigued, weak, and nauseous the rest of the day. I fell asleep multiple times and napped by accident. By 10pm,  almost exactly 24 hours later, I felt fine again.

                                                The syringe was larger and looked full. It took a long time for medication to go into the arm due to the amount of liquid injected into the muscle.  Right away the full left arm and breast were painful.  The arm pain continued to get worse and felt like she hit her funny bone but more extreme and this pain lasted all night into the next day.  She was unable to sleep due to the full arm pain.  The significant pain in the breast area lasted all day into the next day too. Also, felt chills and body aches starting that evening into the next day and night. We did not know the dose was only supposed to be 0.5 ml at the time of injection. We suspect she received at least 5 ml instead of the recommended 0.5ml.The name of the nurse that administered the vaccine is written on the vaccine card but not sure of spelling. RN?

In my better judgment patient looked normal and healthy at taht time. Patient 5 min later felt dizzy and fainted for 10 sec before recovering. I called 911 and gave water while the other rph gave cold compress. Patinet recovered quickly when ambulance came but patient refused further medical care and has had history when given vaccine this dizziness occurs. Family member came to pick her up and walked without issue

Upon calling the health center, they said that I may have eaten something bad. Around 6pm the same day, I started sweating but I was freezing, and had a headache and muscle pain. I had a 101 fever and that persisted until the next day (3/24/21). It is currently (3/24/21) and I have noticed sharp chest pains on the right side of my chest throughout the day, especially when exerting forces breathing (such as riding my bike or walking up stairs, or getting into and out of bed). I still have a slight fever and feel very cold, but I in fact, still have a slight fever of 100.4

I self recovered after about 5-10 min. About 20-30 minutes after that my legs started feeling tingling like they were going numb and I was experiencing hot flashes. This self recovered after 5 min. I was admitted to the ER and monitored for another hour but was stable.

Along on those immediate symptoms I got the injection on my right arm and I experienced pain shooting up from my right arm into my neck and currently still have those pains from time to time when I move my right arm at an elevated angle. Day 4 of the vaccine I woke up one morning with swollen glands, congestion, swollen nasal glands, low grade fever of 100 degree F, very itchy irritated throat and hard to swallow, visited a clinic to see if I possibly had flu or strep but all my test results returned negative, also I had a covid test done and it was negative, I have never contracted covid 19 prior to vaccine and current day. Additionally, symptoms of congestion worsened and I am now experiencing some laryngitis due to the swelling of my lymph nodes, only sinus medication lessens the congestion to manage, I feel very fatigue, and experiencing some migraines.  Today only marks 1 weeks since the vaccine

                                                I received an allergy immunotherapy shot the day before my first dose of the vaccine and instantly felt nauseous and extremely tired after receiving the vaccine, which continued for two days after receiving tut. Three days later, I woke up struggling to breathe (but not anaphylactic), covered in hives, itchy all over, shaking, disoriented, and chilled but not truly feverish.  I reported this to my allergist, who prescribed prednisone and suggested the vaccine combined with immunotherapy were too much for my immune system for one week. The hives, itchiness, and difficulty breathing lasted about four days. I struggled with fatigue and nausea for over two weeks, stopping all school and work in the meantime. After my second dose, I feel just a bit tired and sore, so I think this truly was a bad reaction to the two injections combined rather than to the vaccine itself. Still, it was a debilitating experience,  and I would recommend considering putting out guidance that other immunotherapy patients space out their allergy injections and vaccines farther than I did.

We talked and made sure she was comfortable, had some ice and water available, and a space to lie down if needed.  After the vaccine  was given she did feel nauseous and hot so we had her lie down with her feet up.  She had ice water and we provided a glucose tablet for her which she said made her feel better as well.  After about ten minutes she felt better and we had her wait the 30 minutes after the shot to make sure she did not have further reactions.

I have aches in my legs, neck, arm, and lower back (I?m supposed to have my period soon, so it?s possible that the back pain is not vaccine related). I have a headache that has persisted since about 11:30 am. I have not taken any medication. I would say on a pain scale of 1-10, the pain is about a 4 (quite uncomfortable but bearable).

                                                Patient stated she felt like fainting post immunization. Pharmacists quickly grabbed adverse event protocol and followed directions as stated. Called code white on intercom to alert store management. Asked patient about symptoms and she reported symptoms of sweating, coldness, dizziness and nausea. Assessed patient blood pressure and asked patient if she wanted us to call 911. Patient did not want us to call 911. Patient never lost consciousness but had low blood pressure on initial reading. Instructed patient to lay down with feet elevated. We gave patient a pillow to assist in elevation of feet and gave her cold compresses to apply to neck and face. After a few minutes, patient blood pressure was normal and patient stated that she was feeling better. We requested that she sit for an addition 15 minutes before she can leave. After 15 minutes patient, patient was feeling ok and left with her boyfriend. She was exhausted from work and this was likely the main factor for the feeling of syncope.

It was reported that she &#34;slumped to the ground&#34; and appeared to have had a seizure.  I arrived at her side (at 1603) with EMS checking vital signs.  Pt  was able to whisper and acknowledge me.  She was oriented to person and place.  Her pupils were constricted, but was lying in the sunshine.  EMS had already called for ambulance.  I talked with Pt to obtain any medications, history and allergies - to which she denied all.  She then began to tremor with her eyes rolling into her head, unresponsive during this episode.  After about 20 seconds, she focused on me and was able to respond to some direction.  By that time ambulance was present. She was lifted by 6 people and placed onto stretcher.   Stretcher placed into ambulance and went to hospital

However, 7 days post-vaccine the injection site became itchy and painful to touch. The pain went away within a day, but the site remains itchy (10 days post-vaccine). The injection site now also has a light yellow bruise on it.

                                                Immediately after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine the patient began to feel nauseous, hot and her arm was hurting. I kept her in the immunization booth and monitored her. Within a minute of her initial feeling she stated that she was having trouble seeing and was &#34;going to black out&#34;. She immediately lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back, and her head went limp and fell back. She then began a twitching movement, made a snorting noise and then all of her limbs went rigid and extended straight out. At the first sign of her reaction we paged management and then as soon as she had loss of consciousness we contacted 911. She regained consciousness and was able to start answering my questions within 30 seconds to 1 minute. We did get the patient water and began to fan her to help cool her off. She was able to tell me who she was, where she was and why she was here. We also gave her some chips and had her eat slowly and drink small sips. She had stated that she was very nervous at the beginning of our pre immunization questions. She told us after that she had not eaten a lot before coming for the shot, but did eat more than normal because she knew she was coming in. She contacted her parents to inform them of the situation. She was able to recount everything prior to her loss of consciousness. When EMS arrived she was able to answer their questions. They took her vitals and all were in normal range, BP=119/66, pulse=98. They asked her to stand and she was able to stand and maintain balance on her own, but stated her legs felt a little &#34;shaky&#34;. She refused transport to the hospital by EMS, but did call her roommate to come pick her up. I had her wait in the COVID waiting area until her roommate arrived. I called her around 4pm (same day) to check on her and she said she is feeling much better. Her mom (a nurse) also came down to stay with her and was with her when I called.

                                                Almost immediately following the injection I had vision abnormalities and tingling in the arm, up to my hand, that had received the vaccine. Ten minutes later I had pain and soreness in the same arm. About three hours later I had mild nausea and the next day the pain and soreness in that arm increased at the beginning of the day and began to decrease as the day went on.

                                                I got my injection about 6 hours later my arm started to feel completely broken from shoulder to fingers. I could not move it without intense pain for a few days. Then pain followed off and on that felt like I hit my funny-bone perpetually. 5 weeks later, the pain became so bad that I went to the ER for treatment. I also had an x-ray done earlier in the week for it at an orthopedic clinic who told me the injection was injected too high and into my bursa. They scribed PT. But when in ER, My arm started to go completely numb. I then received steroids to take 5 days orally. The pain has gotten a little better but I have limited movement without feeling nerve pain all down my arm into my fingertips.

                                                Got shot on a Tuesday 3pm, arm sore right away, full body aches appeared 12 hours after. I woke up Thursday morning with a left swollen labia minora and a stinging sharp pain wiping after urination, blood spots on TP. I took flash photos to see what it looked like at the entrance of my vagina. I saw a cluster of small, bleeding, open wound sores, looked like speckles of blood. I saw a doctor at Health Services the next morning and was told it looks like I have herpes. I did a viral culture swab for hsv. I had just tested negative for a full panel std test (minus hsv) in February, so we did not redo it. Monday, I got the call, my doctor said the results were negative and most likely a false negative, she said she is sure I have herpes. Tuesday, the next day I go into health services again to get a second opinion from another doctor and get re-swabbed. The second doctor agreed it looks just like herpes and she doesn&#39;t know what else it could be. We do another viral culture swab and she confirmed that she picked up fluid from the sores this time. I was also swabbed for gonorrhea and chlamydia and redid the full panel std blood test from February. The results all come back negative, and the doctor says she doesn&#39;t know what else it could be besides herpes. I am fed up with no answers and go to an urgent care. The doctor does not know what my lesions could be from. We did another viral culture swab that tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia and hsv. She offered pills to treat chancroid just in case and I took them thinking it was risk free. By the time I got home I was throwing up for a couple hours. My results come back negative. My second doctor calls me and says she is confident I could have syphilis (even though the sores were the most pain I&#39;ve ever experienced). I came in to give blood for syphilis and hsv testing. Both came back negative, but the doctor was telling me I should still go somewhere for syphilis treatment (a shot I think?). I was even more frustrated.  I sought out an OBGYN center that specializes in ulcers. The amazing doctor agreed with me that I do not have any std&#39;s and that my ulcers were a result of the vaccine. By this time the sores were healed.

Severe stutter  On Wednesday May 5, starting around 3:00PM: Persistent stutter, full body jitters that progressed to upper body muscle spasms (primarily in the neck and shoulder region) that worsened throughout the evening. Checked into the ER approximately 4:30PM and was administered a muscle relaxant (I believe) through an IV to lessen the spasms around 7:00PM. Muscle spasms and stutter persisted until approximately 4:00PM on Thursday, May 6 at time of discharge from hospital.

She did not pass out or fall out of her chair.  It was conveyed by the pharmacist to the technician staff that the patient was having difficulty breathing.  911 was called. 2nd pharmacist went into room to assess and pt was breathing fine.  She asked for some water and a bag of ice which were both given to patient. Paramedics arrived and took patient vitals.  Patient refused and further care and a relative came to pick her up.  Paramedics advised patient to follow up with further care if warranted.  When patient left she was feeling better.

Some heaviness in her chest  which progressed over next 10 minutes to feeling difficulty breathing - &#34;like a rock on her chest&#34; . At 09:04 AM She used her Albuterol asthma inhaler to see if it would help her breathing. No improvement in breathing, then complained at 0911 of some vision changes, felt like she was having to concentrate to breath - like breathing through a straw and at this time I started to hear her audibly wheezing - Squad was called. When they arrived around 9:18 AM she was having heaviness, closed her eyes - complaining of a little bit light headed, still having difficulty breathing.  She left with squad at 9:24 AM

I started to get warm and felt like I was about to vomit so I washed my face with cool water. I went to sit down and my vision started to blur and my vision started to close in with darkness and I passed out. When I gained consciousness again, I was still extremely dizzy and light-headed and my vision was still not focused. I passed out two more times. When I gained consciousness the final time, I was extremely sweaty and shaky. I called 911 and they sent paramedics to my house. I drank some water and stayed in the floor until they arrived. They took me by ambulance to the hospital to run several tests and everything looked normal.

                                                I got my shot Thursday afternoon... beginning while I was sleeping that night until I woke up I was freezing and then woke up sweating. On Friday, I had a headache when I woke up as well as body aches and pains. Additionally a large swollen, red, warm spot appeared at the injection shot. It is very itchy. I googled it and found that it is considered ?Covid Arm?. Saturday I still had a headache and achey body and both friday and saturday i was very tired. I also developed a deep, junky cough on Friday which I think was due to the shot.

Every single muscle and joint in my body hurt, it felt like I had been hit by a train. I could feel soreness down to the muscles in my hands. I could barely move, I couldn?t get comfortable. My head and neck hurt the worst, it was just so sore and painful and everytime I stood up, I would get a pounding sensation in my head. It went on like that for almost 12 hours. The next day I felt perfectly fine.

Patient was instructed to lay down on floor.  After assisting patient to the floor with  legs elevated, she was observed to have blanching of lips.  Check injection site to see if there was any swelling.  None noted.  Continued to observe patient for 5 minutes while asking questions to ensure that  there was no airway constriction.  After patient was able to sit up, she was offered water to drink.  Patient admitted to having not eaten anything today.  When patient felt well enough to walk she was escorted out by her mother.  It was revealed during conversation that patient has an extreme needle anxiety.

                                                I took the vaccine on April 6th around 8:40 PM, and the next day around 2:30 AM I noticed multiple pumps on my chest area and the back part of my thighs, and they were quite itchy. On April 8th, I woke up with my lips completely swollen, very tingly, and feeling warm - I, unfortunately, had a college test on that exact day and could not go to the hospital straight away. They told me to go get it checked and go to the hospital in case I have trouble breathing. My lips ended up going back to normal eventually. I went to three different doctors after a couple of days because I kept getting sick and also to explain the situation and ask if I could even take the second dose of the vaccine since it was approaching. All three doctors told me not to because my body could go into anaphylactic shock, so I did not take it.

                                                Two days after receiving vaccine, began with bilateral knee pain and stiffness, shortly followed by rash over both legs. Over the next few hours, the rash became more prominent, and pain in knees, ankle and shins made walking difficult. Went to ER and was diagnosed with  Henoch-Schonlein purpura and told to take Ibuprofen for pain and to follow up with PCP. Rash continued to spread over the next two days to include both upper arms and elbows, with broken blood vessels. Also developed swelling in knees and more severely in ankles.  CBC with differential in ER was reported as normal. Visited PCP 5/23/21, who referred to dermatologist and completed urinalysis which was essentially normal with possible elevated white cells to be cultured.

                                                After about 5 minutes of administering the vaccine, the associate overlooking the observation area came to tell me a patient was not feeling well. I immediately grabbed my carat and went out to the IMZ area next to pharmacy. The patient was still seated and she was conscious, but appeared very weak, sweaty, and slightly pale and cold to the touch. I immediately made sure she could respond to my questions. She was able to respond. I asked if she had eaten before coming in and she confirmed she had not eaten that day yet.  I checked her blood pressure and it was 68/33. I stayed by her side and her mother was fanning her on the other side. I had her take several breaths in and out and could visually see her responses improving. She asked for water, which her father handed to her. I checked her blood pressure again and it was up to 125/68. She reported feeling much better and was able to joke around with her sister who also received the vaccine at the same time. I asked her to sit for an additional 15 minutes, on top of her original 30 minutes, and told her parents I would be back to check her blood pressure gain. I came back into the pharmacy and prepared another vaccine. After I administered the next vaccine, I checked her blood pressure again, which read 95/68 and her mom stated this was normal for her. I advised her to stand up slowly before walking. A few minutes later she came to the pharmacy window for her vaccine card and reported feeling normal and her parents thanked me and they all left.

She appears to have had a petit mal seizure. Her pupils were very dilated and it took her several minutes to become fully responsive, although she was unresponsive for just a short period of time. She is a student and the EMS staff who responded to the 911 call reports that she is well known to them, as she has a history of &#34;pseudo-seizures&#34;.  Patient&#39;s BP was 138/84 and SPO2 was 98%. Pt was transported to ED around noon, and was back to the clinic by 1:15 to collect her eyeglasses that had been left where she was sitting.

She was barely responsive and talking very faintly- NO difficulty breathing or any symptoms of allergic reaction. Had a staff member call 911. After a few minutes she threw up and then she was able to communicate a little more than earlier. She mentioned that she had a similar reaction to another vaccination in the past and her mother said that she (the pt) was a little scared and worried before coming in to get the shot. The paramedics arrived soon after, briefed them the sequence of events. She was doing well by then. F/u with a call to patient at around 4pm-all ok she said.

It lasted two days and was worse when standing or moving.  It was less intense on the second day, but hives appeared on my left arm and my arm was more sore on the second day, and stayed sore for 5 days. The body aches started around 10:00 pm on the first day.  Then fatigue and joint pain.  Really awful.

At 3:00 am, woke up with squeezing chest pain,  sharp stomach pain , dizziness and presyncope.  Magnesium cream was applied to the chest wall and to the abdominal wall.  Thiamine and Rhodiola and probiotics were given.  Symptoms improved today.

I broke my nose and busted my lip during it. The only signs I can think of that may have been a warning was that I couldn&#39;t spell cardiac and I had Deja Vu. My CT and MRI scans came back normal I go for a 24 hour EEG on June 26th. The doctors are unsure of what caused it.

                                                The date of the second dose was 05/25/2021, which is when the side effects started. I had the normal and expected effects, such as a sore arm and fatigue. I began my period that morning, before I went in for the shot. I would like to be as detailed as possible, so I will likely include some graphic details in this description. My apologies in advance.  My period normally lasts 3-4 days and is moderate (as far as I know) regarding blood loss. After the second dose, the flow was extremely heavy and my period lasted for almost an entire week (7 days). It was miserable. I was bloated and tender in that area, and extremely tired. I was also cramping, which is unusual for me nowadays.  About two weeks after that, I felt a stabbing or ripping pain in the uterus area. It stayed for about two days, throbbing every minute or so. I could not sleep those days. It was not so unbearable that I could not perform everyday actions, but it was taking up a good portion of my thoughts that weekend. After that, it went away and I thought it was over.  About three days ago from today (today is June 22nd, or 06/22/2021), the pain returned and I knew it meant the start of my period. The timing was normal. The next day I began bleeding, but the flow is again much heavier than normal. The pain is back and much worse than before. I am going through many more pads than usual and it is, for me, a worrying amount of blood. Since this is the second period in a row I am experiencing this, I felt it was necessary to report it in. I hope this is okay and not taking resources from those with worse issues.  I would also like to note that I experienced my first panic attack in 5 years the night of my second dose (for no reason- they&#39;ve always had a concrete reason for occurring) and my anxiety was notably worse that week (I am on medication and was otherwise doing very well managing the anxiety). During the attack I experienced the usual symptoms: my throat closing up and making it harder to breathe, and uncontrollable shaking and crying.  I was not thinking of anything that would make me nervous at the time of the attack. I had just finished an online gaming session with a friend and was showering to prepare for bed, so I was fully relaxed.  Additionally, my mental health has notably dipped a bit over the last month, though there are a number of factors at play and I don&#39;t want to blame the vaccine for that. However, I was told to at least make note of it here just in case there does end up being a correlation.

The tingling also went back up her arm to her neck causing muscle strain in the area and causing her to crack her neck. Patient&#39;s primary care provider told her this tingling is a result of the vaccine being given too low on the arm. Patient also reports she has gone to physical therapy as a result of this adverse event she associates with the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

The next morning 12/29/2020 I woke up with a migraine and still had severe pain in my arm. That night (12/29/2020) I began feeling aches and pains throughout my body and felt that into the next morning (12/30/2020). The evening of 12/30/2020 I noticed a dollar coin sized red spot on my arm that was warm to the touch and was slightly raised. (By this time my arm pain had decreased but was still present.) The red spot had grown slightly by 12/31/2020 but not much. Friday 01/01/2021 I hadn&#39;t payed much attention to the spot but it looked the same. The morning of 01/02/2021 I woke up and had noticed that the spot had taken over a large portion of the outer bicep on my right arm.

At 10:28PM my temperature went up to 101.5. Took Tylenol and fell asleep woke up at 3AM fever of 102.3 . Fell asleep and woke up again with a fever of 102.6. I had chills nausea weakness body aches headache. Took Tylenol again and fell asleep only to wake up again at 6:30Am  still with a fever of 102. Nothing was making it go away I had no appetite extremely fatigued and nauseous it felt like I had covid again. I also felt swollen lymph nodes under my arm. By Sunday I was feeling way better and my fever was gone. Monday my ear popped again lasting a minute that?s never happened before. Monday today 01-05 still having headaches and now chest pain. I felt so bad I wanted to go to the hospital but did not it really did feel like I had covid all over again I would not want to put my self through that again.  Also I did have covid back in October I believe just wanted to put that out there.

On 12/28/2020 noticed the pain was back and I now have a medium sized lump in my armpit that was causing pain. On 12/31/2020 began to have a rash around the injection site that was increasing in size and limiting arm mobility. PCH EH sent CG to WorkMed and CG was given Rx for Keflex which was completed on 01/07/2021--CG stated symptoms are greatly improve.

                                                Less than 24 hours after receiving the vaccine (Jan 7), I started experiencing bad stomach pain, which a family friend had also experienced after she received the vaccine (also ~24 hours later). It did not subside with time, and became feeling like a shooting pain that was coming and going in waves, and I could not sleep that night. I was nauseous at one point, and threw up. I drank water throughout the night, which seemed to help a little bit and was taking an NSAID. The following day (Jan 8), the shooting pain continued, and I was in bed all day. I became nauseous at one point during the day, when attempting to move a piece of furniture, but did not throw up. I continued taking NSAIDs, which did not help. I was able to sleep through the night after taking melatonin, but was in discomfort. The following day (Jan 9), I woke up, and the shooting stomach pain had radiated to my chest, and had not subsided. I called my PCP, who I was unable to see due to timing/distance from the office, and she recommended I go to an ED if I did not feel better. As the pain was in my chest, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it had radiated there or was cardiac related, I had a friend drive me to the ED. My results came back normal at the ED, and the PA was only able to tell me that it was GI related, due to the pain in my stomach/esophagus. She was unsure if it&#39;s GERD, gas trapped, or some other GI issue. I am still experiencing this pain (Jan 11), but have somewhat managed it by taking Tums and eating alkaline foods.

They kept me in the Emergency department until 5:30am because they could not get my heart rate to stay down. Stony Brook nurse told me it was okay to get vaccine even though I was infected with COVID-19 ON 12/15/2020.

                                                I recieved the first dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/5/21 and did not experience any adverse reactions in the days following. Then, on 1/13/21 (8 days post vaccine) I noticed hives covering most of my body. My face was tingling and my lips were swollen. I took an antihistamine that evening hoping it would go away. The day after 1/14/21 I woke up with the hives all over my body, especially on my face. They were very severe and itchy. I went to my dermatologist and they recommended a steroid cream and oral antihistamine to help reduce the itching. It is now 1/15/20, and the hives are still covering most of my body with severe hives on my face.

This continued but then completely stopped 2 hours later, weirdly it returned exactly 24 hours later only not as extreme. I feel fine now but I also felt the need to call 911 during this episode.

This lasted a few hours.  1/15/21- 3:45am I got up to use bathroom and noticed I was very lightheaded. I thought maybe I just stood up too fast. I got back in bed and my arm was 8/10 pain so I also thought faintness could possibly due to pain.  7:15am I got up to go to work and quickly felt very warm and my vision started to go black. I laid back down for a few minutes until this resolved. I took my temperature and it was 99.0. I got up again and started to get ready but began feeling light headed again. I ended up getting ready while sitting down because I kept feeling too much like I was going to pass out. I ate breakfast and felt fine. 8:00am I left for work and after driving for about 5 minutes I felt myself getting very warm again and light-headed. I ended up pulling over and calling for someone to come pick me up.  9:00am My temperature was 99.5. My blood pressure laying down was 110/74 and HR was 74. After standing for 5 minutes my BP was 90/70 and my HR was 92. During this 5 minutes of standing I felt myself getting warm again but my vision did not start to go black and I was able to stand for the full 5 minutes.  At various times throughout the day I would feel faint if I was standing or sitting upright for too long. The last time I felt this was was probably 11:30pm on 1/15/21. 1/16/21 - No light-headedness or warmth. Did feel some slight chest pressure, but nothing crazy and it only lasted maybe half of the day.

She reported the itching resolved after the medications and then she is still complaining of breast pain.  She noticed 2 drops of fluid out of her right nipple.  I do not necessarily know that this is an allergic reaction I am just not sure what to make of the coincidence with the Covid immunization it could be entirely unrelated.  Advised follow-up with her PCP regarding these issues.  Return precautions discussed.  She verbalized agreement and understanding with plan of care.  Sent home from ED.

                                                Right after the injection, I had minor arm soreness which increased as the day went on. Approximately 12 hours after the injection I started feeling very tired and achy. My arm hurt very badly and I started getting chills. About an hour later I had a 101.1 degree fever. I also experienced very slight shortness of breath which went away when I used my albuterol inhaler. My shoulder where I got the injection hurt so badly that I could like raise it, lie on it or touch it really.   The fever continued into the night but was gone by around 9am.   I continued to feel tired and achy all day the next day, with occasional shooting headache pains. I did feel better and better as the day went on though.   Question: I take a daily supplement of 6g of marine collagen. I happened to take the marine collagen 1 hour before the onset of chills and fever - could there be a correlation between the collagen and the worsening symptoms? I have never had any type of reaction to the collagen before and have been taking it for about 3 weeks.

I woke up the next morning after not being able to sleep all night with a temperature of 101.7 Fahrenheit coupled with profuse sweating and a stabbing headache. I took some Tylenol and drank a bunch of water and tried to go back to sleep ( Inhad woken up at 5:30). I was unsuccessful because I ended up having to vomit about 20 minutes later. Throughout the day, my temperature hovered between 99.5-100.4 even though I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen. The symptoms persisted all day and I only started to feel relief around 7 pm. I feel fine today, but I still have a bit of a headache and my left arm is still sore.

It went away and I had body aches later that day and the next day. Thursday I had a red spot on my arm below the injection site.

My heart rate was elevated but that could have been related to my anxiety. I layered clothing on and finally managed to sleep.

After rest, Tylenol, and fluids, I felt better around 8 that evening.

                                                Headaches, body aches, and fatigue started in the middle of the night on the 26th/in the early morning of the 27th around 2-3am. These continued throughout the day of the 27th until around 6pm when symptoms subsided. Slight fever also started around the same time, but stopped around 3-4pm of the 27th. I took 400mg of advil once at around 7:00am, and once again at 1:30pm. These helped alleviate some symptoms. At the end of the day on the 27th, most symptoms (except for sore arm) were gone!

                                                Right after getting the shot, I felt dizzy, had a sore arm, and my heart was beating too fast, for about an hour. At 9:30 the next morning, I developed a fever of 100.5 and body aches. Around 2 pm, I got a headache which felt like it was because blood was hitting the veins in my head really hard- I think that&#39;s high blood pressure? My blood pressure was 126/85. I read not to take medicine because it would make the vaccine less effective, but I had to take an aspirin at 8 pm because I couldn&#39;t handle the headache any more, and ever since, I&#39;ve just had a sore arm and a headache when I walk too fast (it&#39;s been two days after the shot now).

At work (noon), suddenly became very lightheaded, cold, sweaty,  experienced blackout vision around periphery and felt faint and nauseous. Threw up. Went home and had extreme chills and could not get warm. Nausea subsided around 6:00pm 1/27. Headache and neck soreness continues still today (1/30). Headache feels like pressure inside my head, pushing and causing dull pain at the base of my skull and top of neck.

The stiffness turned into nerve problems and I felt hot and tingly on my neck, back and head for several days. 8 days later from the vaccination day i got a huge rash on my left arm. On top of that my armpit area was severely sore . Soreness and pain from the arm continued 2 weeks later.

I fell asleep at about 8 pm because I was so fatigued I couldn?t keep my eyes open. Chills when I was trying to sleep. I was up a few times throughout the night sweating. The next morning I felt nauseous and had a bad headache and my body aches. I felt like this the whole next day and am still completely fatigued.

                                                At 6:30PM on 2/6 (29.5 hours after I received my 2nd Moderna vaccine dose), I developed a small cluster of hives on my left arm around the crease of my elbow (4-5 inches away from the injection site). The hives continued to spread outward until they covered about 25% of my arm 2-3 hours after the hives first appeared. This was the height of the pain/swelling/itchiness. The hives gradually moved upward along my arm and are currently an inch or two below my injection site (5 hours after the adverse effects began).

This lump went away after some time on its own.   Today, 02/06/21, the itchiness and pain returned, and what looked like a ?ridge? shape under my skin appeared on my arm at the site where the shot was administered.  It?s just bothersome but doesn?t impair my regular functionality. I intend to take a Benadryl and stay hydrated. Noticed I?ve been excessively thirsty today, much more than usual.

I developed hives on my forehead, cheeks, neck, chest, and arms. The fingers on both my hands and my lips were tingling.  Treatment: I was rushed to the ER and given an IV steroid, IV fluids (2 bags), and IV benadryl.   Outcome: All the reactions went away within 4 hours and I was discharged from the ER. I was advised to take benadryl for 48 hours afterwards as needed and given a 5 day course of prednisone; 2 tablets taken daily.

                                                I got my first dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine on Wednesday February 3rd. I was completely fine, definitely experienced a sore arm for 2-3 days. Noticed my injection site was pretty low to where you would normally put an IM injection. Also noticed, swelling locally around the injection site every day after getting the COVID vaccine. The j je tino site felt warm to the touch and was still swollen. Around Friday night, I started to get really itchy. Didn?t think much of it. Until I took a look on Saturday afternoon. My top half of my back, my neck and left ear where covered in small weird hives/bumps and was red and itchy. I took some Benadryl, and hoped it went away. It didn?t. Sunday morning my left ear was getting even more swollen, and this time the rash wasn?t all on my top back, but instead, traveled down my spine. This is when I decided to head to the ER since no urgent care was open, and they ruled it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave me a steroid and Benadryl injection IM, and am reporting this the morning after. I currently haven?t felt any itching or have noticed much swelling/redness. I think it?s also important to note that I?ve never experienced an allergic reaction to anything, this my first ever, that I can recall.

After deep inhalation and exhalation, pt was administered a Benadryl 25mg and 8 ounces of water patient&#39;s color began to return and her breathing improved and her abdominal pain resolved. Patient was monitored for 30 minutes and assessed before departure.

That went away so I thought that it was fine, however, two days ago I looked in the mirror and I had a large red circle around the injection site. It is itchy, red, swollen, and sore. It has been over a week since I received the vaccine so I was a bit worried about it.

He had given it to me in my SUV. My arm was so sore for 2 days to where I could barley even lift it. I struggled so hard to do basic things and had to rest my arm and switch between hot and cold treatments for those 2 days. Still nothing really helped. I couldnt even lift my arm above my head without using my other arm to help support it. Even when i did that, it still was so painful.  The night of getting the second shot, I had body aches and a fever that reached 100.2.  As the days went  one i was able to move my arm more and more but i still have pain when  i move my shoulder a certain way.

                                                I?ve never been so sick in my life. The first dose wasn?t too bad but this time I was vomiting so violently that there was a profuse amount of blood coming out for 3 hours. I?ve never experienced a migraine but I?ve had an extremely painful and debilitating migraine since 4am. Around 10am I was dry heaving and vomiting up bile. I have excruciating back pain since 10pm last night, horrible full body chills, fever of 102, skin, and light sensitivity.

That evening I had bad chills through the night and next morning. I took tylenol and got a low fever on 2/13. Lump was red and grew all day. Had low fever all day, increased to 101.6 in afternoon despite the Tylenol. Fatigue, headaches, and body aches. 2/14 I felt better in the morning. Headaches and fatigue still. Large red lump/swelling on arm (around 3 inches wide) at site of vaccination, arm still sore and painful to touch.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

I was lightheaded and nauseous for the remainder of the day. I know pain is a typical side effect, but this was unusually intense pain and I felt I should report it. I quite literally felt delirious after coming-to on the floor.

                                                The vaccine was administered to the patient in the consultation room. Once we left the consultation room, after about 2 minutes, the patient got my attention and complained of feeling dizzy. I went to her side, and she told me that she felt like she was going to pass out. The patient then proceeded to lose consciousness while sitting in a chair in the waiting area. She then exhibited seizure-like movements (muscles contracted, groaning sounds) for about 10 seconds, and she then regained consciousness. I administered no treatment, since this did not exhibit the signs of an anaphylactic reaction. 911 was called, and emergency medical services arrived. The patient was then taken to the hospital. The patient stated that she has had a similar reaction in the past to getting a vaccine, she thinks it is from the stress of getting injected with a needle.

                                                Welt on right arm appeared the morning after I received the shot. About 2 inches in diameter (circular). It is a raised welt and is slightly itchy. Pain in about 4 on a 1-10 scale. Feels mostly like a bruise is being pushed on. I do have very sensitive skin so it is probably a slight allergic reaction. The doctor did an awesome job with the shot (10/10 hope she does it again). I feel great other than my arm being a little sore. No fever, headaches, etc. My arm has get slightly tingly today but nothing concerning. Definitely not a bad enough reaction to deter from getting the 2nd dose! :D

As the day has gone on, my arm has become swollen around the injection site, has become more sore, and it hot to the touch. There is no rash. The soreness/pain radiates down my arm and up my shoulder.

                                                Pain in left arm came 14 days after receiving 2nd vaccination. Deltoid on left arm  is very sore. There?s a red spot and warmth where the shot was injected, but not visible swelling. Arm feels very weak, it shakes when I lift my arm.  I feel a throbbing pain while my arm is at rest.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Vaccination site formed a hard, hot to the touch knot 1-2 hours after injection given. Right arm was consistently sore and hard to lift above head. About 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, my right arm, shoulder, upper back, hand, fingers, knee, ankle, foot, and toes all began to feel tight and lose sensation. By March 12, I was walking with a limp and struggled to move my right arm at all.

                                                Vaccine was injected into my left arm muscle. I have a Nexplanon birth control implant in the same arm on the inside of my left arm. Within a few hours of getting the shot, the place on my arm where the implant is started burning and was blindingly painful to the touch. It felt like the implant was ripped out then re-inserted and was very tender. Symptoms persisted for 24 hours. I have no pain now. I assume it was from muscular swelling, but I think it is something to be aware of.

                                                Patient had what appeared to be a vasovagal reaction.  She complained of feeling light-headed and nauseous about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  This continued for a short time and she also began to complain of feeling chilled and was noticeably diaphoretic.  I monitored her blood pressure, which was low on the initial reading and then eventually came up to a reading of 89/60 with a pulse of 73 at the point that her symptoms began to subside.  By approximately 45 minutes after the episode began, she reported feeling better and was able to stand and walk without symptoms.  She went home at that time with a friend.

                                                About an hour or hour and half after getting  my vaccine, my head became all fuzzy as though I had just finished drinking three alcoholic drinks. I am not someone that can handle my alcohol very well so by that point I&#39;m really out of it. JUST TO BE CLEAR though I was NOT drinking alcohol. It&#39;s just a metaphor. I could not think clear and was having difficulty communicating beyond simple words. About 30 minutes after this all started, I made the decision to not drive for the rest of the day because I felt my reaction time had decreased substantially.  While all of the head stuff was happening, my arm was also hurting, which I expected. However, the pain didn&#39;t stay localized to my deltoid. Instead it radiated down my arm and into my hand. It felt as though my hand had been stabbed with a knife, so my entire arm hurt but the focal points were in my hand and the injection site. The next day the effects were gone but I had a headache. Not a bad headache but it wasn&#39;t localized to a single part of my head.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine I had a sore arm. Within a week I had developed a hard lump under it, and a red ring near the injection site which was hot to the touch and extremely itchy. The rash went away after a few days, but ever since then I&#39;ve suffered from extreme brain fog, dehydration, exhaustion, and just felt overall unwell.

Which presisted to getting hot, red, hard and swollen which made my arm super sore and very painful.  Over the next few days it grew to about 6&#34; in in length and a raised bump of about 1cm appeared.  I took benedryl and used hydrocortisone cream  and ice packs to help and after about 5 days it finally dimished.

                                                She took a dose of aripiprazole 5mg immediately before receiving the vaccine. It caused her to have face tingle, which feels kind of heavy. She was able to drive home safely but feels extemely tired. I, the pharmacist, counseled her to skip her next dose and report to her psychiatrist immediately. Also recommended some bed rest for the next 24 to 48 hours with close supervision and to seek medical attention if any other symptoms appear.

                                                At about 06:15 PM after receiving the Moderna vaccine, patient left hand (the same arm the shot was given) began to turn blue-grey. The nurses there kept her in a room for about an hour, and monitored her vital signs. Everything seemed to be normal except for the discoloration in the skin. She had trouble breathing and some lightheadedness, but it was ruled to be an anxiety response as everything looked normal. Over the time spent in the clinic, the color began to become less intensely blue and fade back to a normal skin color -- but not completely. At about 7:30 PM, she got up to walk and started feeling pins and needles in her arm and upper chest, but this may be due to anxiety.   The feeling disappeared not long after, and we were able to make it home and eat. Everything else that night went OK, except for the fact that her hand is, at the time of this report, still blue-ish in color.

Was unable to get myself out of bed until around 11AM after taking a nap. Used naproxen to bring the symptoms down to a manageable level, but despite taking 440 mg total (220 around 11am, 220 around 8pm), I was mostly bedridden throughout the day. I had very little energy, and moving too much caused dizziness. All symptoms lasted from 4AM on the day after the second dose until waking up the day after that.

When I came to, I was disoriented for about 2 minutes and very cold.  -For a week after I fainted I was very weak and couldn&#39;t stand up without feeling that I was going to faint.  -The second week after my shot I also felt pressure on my chest for 5 days that has since then gone away.  -Since I fainted 3 hours after my shot  I have experienced constant ringing in both ears that have not stopped for the past 30 days since I got the vaccine. I also experience blurry vision and vertigo that hasn&#39;t gone away.  -I have also developed headaches and recently I have an itchy rash on my neck.  -Since then it has been hard for me to focus and sometimes I feel like the world is in slow motion.

                                                Around 6:30, I started feeling dizziness and got a severe headache. After waking up from a nap that night around 9, I woke up to a 101.4 fever, itchy throat, dizziness, naseau, and a swollen, red circle around my injection site that was hot to the touch. I couldn&#39;t sleep due to pain and discomfort from my arm and fever. I woke up around 4:30, vomiting. I took Advil and Hydroxizine around 8 am to sleep, but it still didn&#39;t help as I woke up every 30 minutes. I had a fever of 101.3 and these same symptoms the whole day of 4/14. Before going to bed this night, my temperature was down to 100.3. I woke up the next morning (4/15) and my temperature was down to 99.4, so I went to work. I still had the symptoms of itchy throat, dizziness, and weakness. My arm was still swollen and sore too. Another symptom I thought was interesting that I had was waking up drenched in sweat this morning (4/16) and yesterday morning (4/15).  I even woke up through the night to put a fan on me at high speed and took my blankets off, yet still woke up sweating. Tonight, my temperature is back to normal, but I still have an itchy throat, some dizziness, and an itchy injection site.

                                                Patient appeared anxious prior to vaccine administration.  When asked if she felt like she was going to pass out, patient advised she did not pass out from needles/shots before, but has fainted because of extreme anxiety; but did not feel like she would pass out at this time.  After shot was administered, pt. was more relaxed, and advised she was feeling ok.  Patient was ambulatory, with no complaints of light-headedness or adverse feelings, and walked to the observation area.  Approximately five minutes following vaccination, patient told companion that she did not feel good, and laid down on the floor.  She then experienced a syncopal episode.  Patient did not hit head, or have any injury as a result of the syncopal episode.  Patient was breathing normally, but was unresponsive for approximately 15-20 seconds.  Following episode, patient regained consciousness (COAx3), and was upset from incident, but confirmed no injury or other illness, following episode.  Patient was evaluated by EMTs on site, and was able to sit up and transfer from the ground, to a chair, and the chair to a wheel chair without issue.  Further evaluation was conducted by EMT on site.  Blood pressure was 110/80, SPO2 was 98% room air, and pulse was 66 at approximately 13:22 hours.  Patient laid on gurney/cot on-site for approximately 20 minutes, to rest, and to be monitored for additional side-effects.  During monitoring, patient advised the only thing she had eaten today was &#34;one peanut butter cup.&#34;  Patient was provided water and a juice box during monitoring time.  Patient was released from monitoring area at 13:45 hours, after she advised she was feeling ok.  She was wheeled into the parking area as a precaution, and left with her companion.  Patient was the passenger of the vehicle.

                                                It started with a sorr arm and fatigue. The problem began after I was lying down in bed for 1 hr and 1/2. I laid down at 3:30am, but at 5am I was still awake and my left arm felt like it had fallen asleep. The problem was, I could not seem to wake it up. When I turned on my flashlight, I found that nearly all of the veins in my left hand were invisible, actually everything past the elbow on that side. I tried for about 10 mins while lying down to get blood flow back, but nothing was working. My face.felt very warm and the rest of my body felt very cold. When I finally got up to turn on my bedroom light, I found that all of my veins from my chest down were almost entirely invisible as well. I normally have very visible and easy to get blood from veins (except sometimes in my right arm), so this was very worrying to me. I got up and paced a little around my room to try and get blood flowing again, and I felt pretty shaky while doing this. My hands and feet would shake when I held them up. After about 5 minutes, I sat down on my bed because I did not feel well standing anymore, and I waited. Maybe 10 minutes later and things seem to be returning back to normal. I am still very tired but my whole body seems to have blood again. I am also currently on day 3 of my monthly cycle, but this has never happened in relation to that either.

It isn&#39;t painful whatsoever, but it isn&#39;t a subtle reaction either. I also believe I may be able to feel the muscle under the chin but I&#39;m unsure, it might just be fat haha.

Noticed my chronic back pain (L5 fracture) was very bad, but didn?t initially connect it to the vaccine.   By 4:00 I was running a fever, fatigue, shivering, sweating, could not eat due to lack of appetite / nausea. Could not think straight.   The night of the 22nd (day I received 2nd dose of vaccine) I had difficulty sleeping, heart palpitations, and extremely strange dreams when I did sleep. The next morning (23rd)  I felt much better, even walked around for a bit, but by noon I was back to having sever symptoms. My fever spiked, my energy was drained, and my back pain was unbearable.   This progressed over the afternoon into unbearable tooth pain along with the back pain and other symptoms. Back pain did not recede with rest as it normally does. Ibuprofen did not seem to mitigate symptoms much.  Brain fog was intense and I could not focus on anything.   Managed to sleep last night and had more vivid dreams. Woke up feelings fine but symptoms seem to be slowly returning.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Arm soreness began about 2-3 hours post-injection and steadily increased in intensity/pain throughout the day.  Following day, arm soreness extremely painful with some shoulder joint pain and pain any time upper arm muscle used. Slightly sore by second day post-injection without much discomfort.  Soreness completely subsided by third day post-injection. First day post-injection developed heavy fatigue at the beginning of the day (~8AM) followed by chills and then a fever a few hours after waking up. Thermometer was not used to detect fever.  Had slightly more energy and minimal chills by evening (~7PM).  Fever was subsiding (didn&#39;t feel as warm) but was still sweating pretty easily.  All fatigue, chills, &amp; fever gone by following day (second day post-injection).

                                                Administered the first Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. No apparent concerns were found when reviewing the PQCF and talking with the patient prior to administering the vaccine. Patient verbally stated she&#39;d never experienced a reaction immediately after receiving a vaccine and specifially referred to receiving flu shots annually. Vaccine was administered at 15:02, and the patient was seated in the designated &#34;Post-vaccine waiting area&#34; located directly in front of the pharmacy windows. At 15:04 patient began to feel nauseated with flacial flushing. CPhT was monitoring the patient. At 15:06, the patient began to exhibit s/s of syncope, including: facial flushing, profuse sweating, nausea, weakness, coldness of extremities, and visual disturbances. At 15:06, the patient&#39;s face/lips began to lose color while stating she was dizzy. Under her own power with aid, the patient was gently transferred from the chair to the floor and placed in the supine position with both feet propped up on the chair. She was given an ice pack and paper towels and remained on the floor for approximately 14 minutes. At 15:21, the patient stated she felt much better and wanted to try to sit up. After monitoring the patient for 34 minutes, she left the pharmacy area under her own power stating she felt much better and still plans on getting the second vaccine. Patient was counseled and questions were answered regarding this reaction.

These spells lasted for a couple of hours but after a few days became more chronic and was matched with fatigue, tightness of chest, headaches, and brain fog.  Impaired ability to complete every day tasks. Began presenting with capilliarities in mid April, along with easy bruising/bleeding and elevated liver enzymes (the enzymes began to stabilize over the following week).  All of these symptoms have persisted (currently May 4th).

About 48 hours after receiving the vaccine in my left arm, the same arm became exceptionally sore, both on the bicep and the inside of the arm. I could not let it relax at my side, since that was painful, and I couldn&#39;t rotate my shoulder in any way without extreme pain. The next day, the pain cleared up but there was a large visible bruise around where the Nexplanon implant was located in my left arm. I think the immune response in my left arm affected the implant and created a more painful experience than usual.

                                                Several hours after the shot, I began to feel very hot all over my face and body. I got very dry to the touch and I became extremely thirsty. I also had full body tremors. When I woke up the next morning (5/4) around 10 a.m., I had a fever, headache, and serious brain fog. My legs ached, especially my hips and knees. The intense thirst and dryness also persisted. I felt lightly nauseous on and off. I took an extra strength Tylenol and drank a lot of water before sleeping again until around 4 p.m.. Once I woke up, I was still suffering from all the aforementioned symptoms, but with less severity. I had another extra strength Tylenol and drank water and a sports drink. I ate a granola bar right after the Tylenol and started to feel a little better. Then I got really hungry, so I ate a muffin and drank an energy&#43; juice drink that had 80mg caffeine derived from green and black tea. I started to feel a lot better after that, though I was still weak and experiencing aching in my legs and hips. I took another nap from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and then ate once more before going to sleep for the night around 1:30 a.m. I have woken up today (5/5) with a slight headache but no other symptoms save the injection site soreness that has also persisted since a few hours after the shot. A note for comparison: as reported, this is my 2nd dose. My first dose had no symptoms whatsoever aside from injection site soreness.

                                                Woke up between 5:30 and 6 am feeling more nauseous than the night before, chills and aches. Stood up to take my temperature and almost fainted (had to sit back down on bed, my ears were ringing and vision was grayed out, I may have been unconscious for a second or two). I was sweating and shaking from that, and went to the toilet and threw up a little bit. Dizziness/faintness persisted when standing until around 9 am.

                                                Adverse effects lasted 8 hours (until about 6AM). Significant discomfort throughout the night, restless sleep, woke up multiple times. Started having extreme fatigue (really difficult to move around) and then I started having something that felt like sinus pressure/pain. Headache began from the middle of my forehead and went around the sides and back. Got really cold, then got really hot while going to bed. Continued feeling very hot (feverish) throughout the night. Felt like the flu. When I woke up I felt relatively fine other than being fatigued for the entire day.

                                                Was fine until I stood up at approximately 9:30pm. Immediately got very fatigued, head started hurting. Bent over to pick something up and my back hurt around where my lungs are; it hurt to breathe. Within 15 minutes I could barely stand up. After about an hour of the symptoms intensifying, I started to get a low grade fever. I took something for the symptoms (alka seltzer daytime pill), but went to bed shortly. I started waking up off and on around 6 (I normally sleep in until noon). At 7am, I woke up feeling like I was on fire. I grabbed my thermometer from my nightstand- it read 104 degrees Fahrenheit. I tried to open my medicine but I was so weak I couldn?t do it myself. I walked downstairs and woke my mom up. She took my temperature and it read 103 since I was no longer in my bed warmed by my body heat. She opened my nighttime alka seltzer and gave it to me along with 800 mg ibuprofen. I went to bed with nothing but a sheet and a cooling pillow. At some point my mom came in and handed me my water but I don?t remember it, however it helped cool me down when I fell asleep with it in my bed. When I woke up at 11, my fever was only 100 and it was the only symptom I had. When I got out of bed at 1, I was fever free. I?ve been fatigued the rest of the day but the fever hasn?t returned and I?ve been taking 325 acetaminophen every 4 hrs.

Symptoms included redness and soreness at the site of injection and swollen lymph nodes in the armpit of the arm where the shot was injected. 12 hours after receiving the second dose I was shaking, nauseated, dizzy, sweating one minute and freezing the next, pain all over the body, my breathing slowed down and lastly there was a loud deafening ringing in my ears. These symptoms lasted a frightening 10 or so minutes leaving behind the bodily aches.

She asked our technician for water. Pharmacist went out to check on her - she was alert but she said at one point everything was bright and she could not hear. She had moved herself to sitting on the floor. Called ambulance just to check her out. Pharmacist monitored her to make sure she was okay until ambulance arrived. We gave her ginger ale and crackers and cold rag and water. At this point patient confirmed she was nervous about vaccine prior and has passed out from giving blood before. Patient had only eaten half a sandwich by 3 PM in the day. Ambulance arrived and reviewed patient&#39;s vitals. She decided not to go with the ambulance. Called patient about 30 minutes after event to check on her, she stated she had gotten something to eat and felt much better. Total incident took place over 10 to 20 minutes. Pharmacist referred patient to her physician for follow up.

She was advised to sit for her entire 15 minute observation period which she did. After 15 minutes, she went to the front store where I&#39;m told she passed out twice, hitting her head at least one of those times. By the time I was alerted, she was responsive. I tried to keep her laying down, but she sat up and began vomiting. I was unable to get a BP reading before EMS arrived.

I felt kind of flushed and tried and dizzy. Then the dizziness got a lot worse the next day. I was extremely dizzy to the point where I couldn&#39;t drive for a week. Also I started having ringing in my ears which is still present. Since then I&#39;ve had a number of other symptoms that have sort of come and gone. I&#39;ve noticed they have gotten bad my second half of my menstrual cycle. Iv had muscle spasms and nerve pain. My left leg felt like it was on fire for a while. Otherwise of yet I&#39;ve just felt like I&#39;ve had lower energy than normal and had more headaches.

Still have not recovered to baseline before the vaccine.

                                                Extreme tingling and numbness in head, legs, arm and hands started hours after receiving and lasted 3 days. Fever/body chills lasted two days after receiving. Extreme dizziness hours after receiving and lasting about 3 days. Abnormal period began one week later (2.5 weeks early) with terrible period cramps, abnormal increase in blood loss, nausea and headache.  About a week and a half after receiving first vaccine I felt real congested, stuffy, and like I had a cold. Abnormal for a generally healthy person without history of chronic or really any sicknesses. Chronic ?cold? feeling every couple weeks since receiving (today?s date is june 26).  The tingling and numb sensation happens every day to this day in my left forearm, palm and fingers, and on the left side of my skull.  It starts gradually and lasts for about 20-40 minutes, about 2-5 times a day. No amount of movement or massage for blood flow helps. Still experiencing irregular and abnormal cycles, and extreme heavy flow almost at once that has never been normal. New direct stabbing and cramping pain has began to occur since my first cycle after the shot. It?s a sharp stabbing and cramping pain in my reproductive organs area. Worsening hormonal acne with no changes to previous routine/no new medications, etc.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Chromosomal anomalies (Potocki-Lupski syndrome since 14 years old.), Autism and Physical impairment.   On 26-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 23-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 07-May-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (Autism has increased) (seriousness criterion medically significant), TREMOR (Shaking) and LOSS OF PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE IN DAILY ACTIVITIES (Having trouble with daily activities). On an unknown date, the patient experienced GAIT DISTURBANCE (Cannot walk again). At the time of the report, AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (Autism has increased), TREMOR (Shaking), LOSS OF PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE IN DAILY ACTIVITIES (Having trouble with daily activities) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (Cannot walk again) outcome was unknown.            The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) was not applicable.  No concomitant medications were provided by the reporter.  No treatment information was provided.  Reporter states that her daughter had shaking, trouble with daily activities and autism has increased.

Patient bleed slightly and while I applied pressure and then a bandaid the patient started to feel weak. I had hear sit in a chair inside the pharmacy and prop her legs. In a couple minutes the patient turned very white and and slumped over in the chair. For a minute she did not respond to myself or her sister talking to her and asking her questions. Within another minute the patient started talking and responding normally. I called EMS and they came within minutes to check her vitals. Her blood pressure was lower than her normal. Her blood sugar was normal. The EMT considered her to have experience vasovagal syncope.

                                                4/5/21: Felt first symptoms while sitting in class. Felt very faint when I had to go to the bathroom and was better after I had gone. The following weeks after the first dose and before the second dose I would still get random faintness feelings and trouble breathing that would make me miss class, events, and other activities.  4/29/21: Received the second dose of Moderna Every day after the second vaccine I felt horribly faint even when I was completely hydrated. I could barely move and felt worse when I would stand or sit. At this point, I developed horrible fatigue and tiredness and even more problems with breathing. 5/13/21: Went to ER for horrible chest pain, heart palpitations, and feeling faint. An EKG, chest XRay, and blood work was completed which all came back normal. 5/16/21: Felt the worst I have ever felt. Was bed ridden for a week because I could not stand or do anything without feeling like passing out. Trouble breathing would get worse especially at night when I was going to bed. I would stop breathing when falling asleep and wake up gasping for air. 6/2/21: Developed a racing heart beat and my body would go into physical panics multiple times a day 6/4/21: Went to ER and had 15 tests done which all came back normal or negative 6/8/21: Visited primary doctor with same symptoms. Had a heart rate there of 110 while sitting and was prescribed a heart ultrasound and holter monitor for my heart 6/11/21: Experienced horrible night where I woke up feeling like my body was failing me and had horrible breathing issues. Went and got the heart ultrasound ad holter monitor put on which came back normal 6/22/21: Went back to primary doctor and had more tests completed since I was very weak, tired, and still felt faint. Came back positive for developing mono along with my other symptoms 6/23/21: Went to cardiologist where I was cleared for a good heart 7/13/21: Visited Gastroenterologist for stool issues that I noticed changed since the vaccine. Experiencing loose stools that are orange since the vaccine in April and now have a nerve triggered my body to make me feel faint whenever I go to bathroom. A colonoscopy is scheduled to make sure nothing else is going on. Overall, I have developed many adverse events that have left me incapable of doing anything. I cannot get a job because I feel awful still and would not be able to withstand a workday. It has also given me horrible anxiety that I NEVER had before that coincidentally appeared when I got the shot and hasn?t left. I still feel these symptoms mentioned above.

                                                Presented with vaginal discharge and abdominal pain. Patient had first Covid vaccine the day before. Patient admitted. Category I, without contractions by report. ROM &#43; negative, no evidence of LOF.  Discharge noted on exam. Cramping likely due to candida vaginal infection.  Patient also has a small, external, non-bleeding hemorrhoid. Of note patient is anemic, will not accept blood products. ER MD concerned about elevated D-Dimer, however with a negative troponin and bnp this is likely normal for third trimester of pregnancy.  Discussed with Dr, patient to follow up in clinic outpatient.

The patient also noted &#34;tingling&#34; in her right arm where she received the vaccine.  In addition, there was localized erythema at the injection site with about 5 cm in diameter.  I gave the patient 37 mg of Benadryl and the edema immediately was reduced in addition to the erythema resolved.  She had no more tingling.  I observed her for 30 minutes and all was fine with the patient.  I then checked on her 1 hour later and all was good.

                                                I had awful migraines that did NOT improve with Tylenol or Ibprophen.  My migraines had an aura to them on the 1/1/2021.  I was also nauseous and had a difficult time keeping food down.  I was also very tired and slept longer than I normally do.  I had my vaccine done on 12/30/2020 and the symptoms did not occur until 1/01/2021. An hour or so after the injection, my arm started to become sore. It was very sore until 1/3/2021. They lasted until 1/3/2021. Now I feel fine.

I woke up a little before 1030PM shaking with chills and nauseated. I couldn&#39;t sleep the whole night, going between sweating and shaking. The next day 1/6/21 I was still unwell, didn&#39;t go into work, felt weak and sore the whole day and noticed my underarm of the arm I received the shot was swollen and painful,. Today 1/7/21, my underarm is still painful and swollen, but the nausea has subsided. Still slightly going between sweating and being chilled.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

                                                From 8am till about 10am I felt shaky after the injection. I dint feel like chills, had no temperature. I could not stop shaking, felt like a deep muscle shake.  I felt shaky and jittery from 8am till 11am. I had a cup of tea where I was able to fall asleep.  I had a telemedicine call and I spoke to a NP and she recommended to go to an ER but I did not go. I just felt very anxious.

                                                I had head pressure that felt like a headache In my temples and the back of my skull around 9-10 hours after the vaccine. Left arm pain starting about 11 hours after shot. Difficult to move arm without intense pain and intense pain at the slightest touch of the arm on or around the vaccination spot. Starting the morning after the vaccination, my glands in my neck were tender and aching like they do when I?m fighting off a cold, I had body aches that you would get if you had a fever for the entire day all over my body. I took ibuprofen that night and they started to go away and I felt hot like I was breaking a fever. I woke up the next morning which is 2 days after the vaccination and felt completely back to normal besides residual arm pain. This pain is bearable and I can move my arm with only a dull pain and I can touch the spot without intense pain however it is still painful.

                                                Patient reported feeling like her tongue was tingling and felt larger than normal. She did not report having any difficulty breathing.  25mg of Benadryl was given orally.  After 10 minutes she thought she was feeling a bit better, but then continued to say that she was having tingling and not &#34;feeling normal&#34;.  We decided to administer epinephrine instead of waiting for her to continue to get worse.  I administered an epi-pen (0.3mg) about 30 minutes after she took the Benadryl and a nurse from the SNF called 911.  Paramedics arrived and evaluated her.  Her breathing sounded okay via the paramedic&#39;s stethoscope.  Because she was still not reporting feeling &#34;back to normal&#34; and because she had epinephrine administered, she was transported via ambulance to the ER for continued monitoring.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, January 5th at 9:00 AM. I felt fine immediately following the vaccine but quickly felt worse throughout the day. I developed a fever of 101.4F with medicine, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and general malaise. I know these are all common symptoms, so I didn&#39;t worry too much. However, my fever has persisted. I stayed home from work Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday due to not feeling well and still having a fever. Thursday, I also developed pain in my armpit with movement and palpation. I am guessing that pain in related to swollen lymph nodes. Friday, the pain in my armpit seemed to spread into my arm. Most of my armpit and the upper inside of my bicep is extremely tender to movement and touch. Today, I still have some tenderness in my arm and my fever is still present. Throughout this week, my fever has remained around 100F, even with Tylenol and ibuprofen.   I contacted my PCP yesterday about my concern for my persistent fever and arm pain. They believe that because I tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020, that I am reacting to the first dose of the vaccine as if I am receiving the second dose of the vaccine. They advised me to continue taking ibuprofen and Tylenol. I am worried that if I receive the second dose of the vaccine, I will be sick for longer.

By the evening, left arm pain was too uncomfortable to wash dishes and lift household objects. Pain woke me up at 3am that night and I could not push the covers off of me, dress or undress, and I experienced severe pain with slight movement (7/10). Nausea and cold sweats began around 5am and lasted for 45min. I contacted the nurse via messaging system and was told to take OTC nausea medicine and Tylenol. I took the maximum dosage for Tylenol that day but could not do my normal school functions. The next day I was still limited by pain but did not require medication to cope. By day three, I had full range of motion back and minimal pain. Day four I am back to exercising normally.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Night of shot arm began to hurt. It became very painful by the time I went to bed. 10x worse than a flu shot Next morning at 8am, got up and almost passed out. Went back to bed. Got up at 10. Arm was painful to move.  Began fever at 12 noon.  Highest was 102. Terrible chills and aches and pains throughout entire body... lasted through bedtime. Tylenol did not  manage the symptoms. Day 3 I was much better. I did experience fatigue, but arm pain was wearing off quickly.

Arm pain began 1-2 hours after injection and progressively worsened throughout day/night. Chest muscle pain began 11-12 hours after injection. Pain lessened 19 hours after injection overnight. 24 hours after injection the only symptom left was minor arm pain localized around injection site.

                                                A few hours after receiving the vaccine I had muscle soreness onset in L deltoid near site of injection. A few hours after that I had moderate soreness in L deltoid, down L arm (bicep/tricep), and up into L pec and trap. I had difficulty abducting L arm to 90 deg but was not hindered in normal movements. Approaching midnight that day the soreness was improving and by mid next day it was limited to L deltoid upon palpation. After 2-3 days soreness resolved. No other adverse effects noted.   I have had very minor muscle soreness to a few vaccinations before, but not this bad. In those cases it has been limited to site of injection (deltoid) and less severe. Usually I don&#39;t notice anything after injections and I&#39;ve never had any other adverse effects.

Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

At this time the injection site was inflamed and painful to the slightest touch and beginning to experience a severe headache   I took Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL and ibuprofen 800. 5am I am waking up with a fever of 101.7, stiff hands, and a continuation of the headache and body aches from the night. I again took ibuprofen 800, and 2 Tylenols extra strength (as needed) every 4 hours,  and Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL in the morning and evening.  My body temperature seemed to have fluctuated every hour being unbearably cold to blood boiling hot with every move I make painful to the point of being bed ridden and needing assistance to get up to go to the restroom.  My injection site has grown from the size of a quarter on Friday Morning 1/22 to  about the size of grapefruit by Sunday 1/24 . I have pictures documenting its growth.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, I had redness around the injection site and a sore arm for about 2-3 days. I received the shot on a Tuesday, and by the weekend my arm felt fine. One week later (Monday 25th), I felt like I had a light fever. My temperature was 99.1F. Tuesday, my left arm where I received the injection was SO SUPER itchy. When I looked at it, there was a huge, red, swollen, bump. The area was about the size of a credit card. The area was also HOT to the touch even though the rest of my arm felt like a normal temperature. From Tuesday 26th through Wednesday 27th (time of reporting), I still have the big, red, hot bump at the injection site, and my fever fluctuates in between 99.1-100.4F. I contacted my doctor who believes it is most likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He has advised me to take benadryl and tylenol, and if I still have the fever tomorrow, he will test me for strep, flu, and COVID. I have not taken the benadryl and tylenol long enough to see if there is any sort of impact. I should also mention that I get tested weekly for COVID at work, and my test from Monday January 25 has come back as negative.

The following day my fingers were sore. Three hours later red bumps erupted on my fingers and palms. Three days following the initial bumps, more bumps appeared on the bottom and tops of toes. Hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl provide minimal relief. The bumps continue to appear 16 days following  administration. The bumps are comparable to the bumps I experience when taking amoxicillin following Epstein Barr virus.

Throughout the night arm pain got progressively worse and could not sleep due to extreme  pain and inability to move through range of motion, in addition to night sweats.  (did not have a fever). Woke up the next morning with a severe headache and nausea. Fainted around 10am (18 hours post vaccination). Headache and minor dizziness continued throughout the rest of the day.  By 24 hours post vaccine, no symptoms besides very minimal arm soreness.

Could not eat all day.  1/27- woke up with headache and slight body aches but otherwise felt okay during the day. Was hungry and able to eat. Starting at 10:00pm my stomach began to hurt again. Experienced bloating, sharp stabbing pain and nausea. Felt like I needed to vomit or pass a bowel movement but could not do either. Took Zofran at 11:00pm, did not help in relieving my GI symptoms. Still on round-the-clock extra strength Tylenol. Could not eat all night.   1/28- woke up still with headache, and mild-moderate stomach pain.  Able to eat a couple bites of food.

                                                Received shot at 2:45pm. Sore/stiff arm started around 6pm. Went to sleep and woke up at 1:00am shaking with a fever and chills. Severe headache, throat sore with swollen glands, could barely walk/move or get out of bed. Also experienced nausea. Took tylenol around 1:00am and again at 5:00am.  Could not move from bed on Wednesday and had to call out of work Thursday with a bad headache, weakness, and overall body pain/discomfort. It is now Friday and I am still having very bad joint and muscle pain when I walk and move and still have a headache and fatigue/weakness.

                                                Within about 20 minutes post injection, patient stated she felt &#34;itchy&#34;. I gave her diphenhydramine and she swallowed it. At about 30 minutes post injection, she stated she had small bumps on her bilateral arms. They were hard for me to discern but she also claimed the bumps were painful.  I asked about any labored breathing or chest tightening and she denied both. After about ~45-50, she still stated the same itchiness and pain. Visually there was no change in my opinion. Patient then conferred with  supervisors at her employment about her next steps. Her PCP was closed and she was deciding if she wanted to go to urgent care. That&#39;s the last interaction I had.

Currently taking Zyrtec to see if the hives go away - bumps all over arms, legs, back - itchy! Hives has been happening for 1-2 days so far.

Within 24 hours of those symptoms they subsided with Tylenol/Ibuprofen. On day 8 following the shot, I began to have an itchy sensation at the injection site. Within hours the injection site began to swell to a raised lime size knot on my skin, which continued to itch, was red, warm, and the raised skin had a few bumps on it. Again I used Ibuprofen/Tylenol and the swelling, redness, and itchiness decreased within 24 hours.

The following morning I woke up and got dressed and used the restroom. I proceeded downstairs to make my coffee.  As I was doing so I became dizzy and nauseous. I sat down on the floor and then I lost my vision and hearing. I broke out in a profuse sweat and had no concept of time. My boyfriend was with me and said it took 5-10 minutes before I began to normalize. I apparently had shallow breathing and turned pale white including my lips, I slowly regained awareness although I never fully lost consciousness. 911 was called and paramedics arrived. by this time I had begun to normalize with most of my vision returning. I ended up declining to see medical attention because I normalized and told the paramedics I would seek attention if it came back.  * please note the physician listed is my PCP but I was not seen for this reaction.

                                                Friday morning I woke up extremely fatigued. I saw stars in my vision and I had to lay in bed all day. I didn?t have energy to even eat. Saturday evening or Sunday morning I noticed red splotches along my torso. Sunday they began to itch and I still have them along my neck, back, upper and lower torso, and a few on my legs. I haven?t changed any environmental factors (no new lotions, creams, hair products, diet, or perfumes). Today I used Benadryl cream, but in the past I?ve been putting my regular, non-scented Aveno lotion and coconut oil.

Over the next few days, I became incredibly itchy and developed a rash on both of my arms. I now have what I think is considered, &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. There is a red circle around the injection site that is swollen, red, and tender. I then noticed the inside of my mouth was sore and I had blisters developing on the roof of my mouth near my gums. My throat is super sore and swollen and has a yellow pocket on the back of my throat. I am also having body aches under my arms near my ribs and back.

                                                It?s been a week since receiving my vaccination and yesterday mid afternoon my arm began to itch. I began scratching and when I realized it was my shot I immediately stopped. I then researched to see if this was a symptom and from what I saw it was. I didn?t feel comfortable taking any medication so I just put ice on the  shot spot. The strength of the itch would vary and at times the spot would get very hot. Towards the end of the night, my whole body began to get hot so I took a shower. The shower extremely helped. I was also able to sleep without the need to itch. It?s now the next morning and the itch is slightly there, but not completely

The next morning after the dose (18 hours after) I experienced headache and dizziness as well. Arm pain lasted 3 days then subsided. I also experienced pain in my armpit.  On 3/6/21 , 8 days after my first dose, my arm began to hurt again and now it is inflamed and there is a rash at the injection site. Armpit hurts again as well .

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on 3/13 at 3:45pm and began experiencing symptoms on the day at 5:30pm including dizziness, nausea, fatigue and wiped-out exhaustion, drunk-like dazed and confused, body heaviness, and developed soreness in the muscle of the right arm where the injection had been administered. The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

Arm was very sore, hot to the touch, and swollen for nearly 3 weeks following the injection.  Second shot on 3/5 R arm, also developed a small red rash but was smaller and went away within a week. Within 24 hours of getting the vaccine, a high fever developed, fatigue, weakness, nausea, pain throughout my body, and migraines.

                                                Injection site pain, headache, and muscle pain. Muscle pain was mainly in the shoulders (more on the side of the injection), lower back, and in the legs. Lasted through the night and took a Tylenol 500mg tablet that next morning (3/18). Symptoms improved slightly, but did not got away and got a little worse as the day progressed (but still improved from the morning). Took another Tylenol that evening, felt better by bedtime, and feel much better today (3/19). Still have some arm soreness when I lift the arm my injection was placed in, but not too bad.

                                                The day after I had a dull headache and pain at the injection site. I also had a slight body ache. This progressed as the day went on. The headache became a severe migraine and extreme body aches. Symptoms are somewhat relieved today, but are still bothersome to the point of having to miss a day of work.

                                                That evening I had slight chills, low fever and body aches, which went away by the next day. The next morning, I had a severe tightening of the left side of my neck and shoulder, along with arm soreness. I saw my Physical Therapist and was told that it was a result of the vaccine. I was fine until I got the vertigo Friday evening. It came on really quickly and I&#39;ve never experienced it before. I was okay the next morning with the exception of a headache, which lasted for about a month after that. My doctor offered shots for them, but I couldn&#39;t take them due to my current meds. I was told to come back if they continue.

                                                On Sunday, March 28th, I started experiencing intense nausea past noon. About twenty minutes later, I started to vomit, and couldn&#39;t stop. In less than an hour, I had vomited over 8 times. I couldn&#39;t drink water (let alone hold any liquid down) before the next vomiting episode. I started to see blood in my vomit after the 2nd time (the doctors say this was due to my stomach aggressively contracting and causing little tears in the muscles). Around 1:30 p.m., my mother took me to the ER to get fluids and anti-nausea medication (magnesium oxide, sodium chloride, lactated ringers, and zofran). After my puking episodes stopped, I was discharged from the hospital and was prescribed more ondanestron (which I&#39;ve used again at home after feeling nauseous again). Other than these symptoms, I have also experienced muscle aches, chills, and a very sore arm. I understand that nausea/vomiting is a reported side effect with Moderna for some people, but considering I&#39;ve never experienced this symptom in any other vaccine (and never vomited back to back so quickly in a short period of time) I figured I would report my symptoms.

                                                I have been experiencing intense upper arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow.  I am not able to lift my arm.  My blood work shows inflammation markers and low levels of ANA and IFA markers.  I did not have any of these symptoms or markers before taking the vaccine.  I am not able to go to work.  I have seen a primary care physician and a neurologist.  When taking the steroid Prednisone, the pain does subside, but I am not allowed to take a steroid for more than one week.   I stopped taking my second dose of Prednisone 4 days ago, and now all the pain has returned and I cannot lift my arm.  This situation is frustrating and scary.  The doctors do not have a diagnosis or treatment plan.  Pain relievers do not help at all.

                                                An hour after I took the Moderna 2nd dose vaccination, I started itching all over my body. It went away after a while and came back worse later that night. My tongue began to itch and I had a rash on some areas. I immediately took 2 benadryls. When I woke up the next morning, the itching was gone. My arm was sore, and I was just tired.

She starts to fill better. she says she is itching and her chest is a little read and has some bumps so I gave her some Benadryl.

                                                Within 30 seconds of the injection of my second dose of Moderna, I experienced extreme nausea unlike any that I have experienced before. Within 1 minute of the injection, my face, arms, chest, and neck flushed and I turned completely red. I felt hot and started to sweat. At the same time, I began having trouble breathing with the sensation that my throat was beginning to close. My eyes filled with tears and I was not able to talk to communicate what was happening. My mom, who was with me at the time of vaccination, asked the administering pharmacist if I could remove my mask because I was having trouble breathing. Throughout this reaction, the pharmacist froze and was visibly in shock of what was happening. Because of this, my mom began asking me questions to figure out what else I was experiencing. Once I was able to remove the mask and breathe deeply, the reaction subsided after two minutes. The pharmacist, after my reaction began to subside, stated that they had an epipen ready to administer if needed. I was never administered the epipen. The pharmacist asked me to wait 30 minutes instead of the general 15 minutes before leaving the site. Because the symptoms went away and did not return within the 30 minutes, I left the site. After the vaccination, I experienced a low-grade fever for 79 hours, chills, a headache, muscle aches, and extreme fatigue. After realizing my reaction was not considered ?normal,? I began to research and realized these symptoms align with anaphylaxis, even though they subsided quickly after experiencing them.

                                                My arm was sore for only a day after receiving the vaccine. But then the area on my arm near the injection site started to itch, and a small mosquito bite-like hive was forming.  Today, 4/14, the hive has grown to about a 2 inch x 1 inch oval. It is slightly raised, slightly red in color,  warm to the touch and occasionally itchy.   I have not attempted to treat it in any way as it is not much of a nuisance however I still wanted to report.

A lot of discomfort from these sensations - Friday 4/16, pain in arm alleviated but heart rate still accelerated and pangs of pain in head. At night, numbness/tingling warmth in left hand and random shooting pain in area of left foot, ankle and shins.

                                                A few days after vaccination I had a high fever and began coughing so hard that I was throwing up. This lasted for about a week, I then became short of breath and tacchychardic. I went to the ER and was admitted for 5 days where they said I had acute bronchitis that triggered reactive asthma. I?m now on steroids and a bunch of medication. This all followed my first dose of Moderna as I?ve never had breathing issues before hand. I?ve never had bronchitis or asthma in my life so this is all new. I am now experiencing nerve pain on my left side which is where I received the vaccine.

Immunizing pharmacist yelled out for Rapid Response from the ER.  Emergency room staff was on scene within 1 minute.  They measured patients pulse and BP and took her to the emergency room for monitoring.  Patient was gone from immunizing area for 30 minutes.  She came back to see us, looking much better and said that she faints all the time.  She remarked she was glad she was seated because when she faints when she stands and hits her head she has a sore head for days.  She proceeded to schedule her second vaccination utilizing the QR reader we had provided to all patients.  Although she didn&#39;t tell us beforehand, afterward she told us she faints all the time, that it isn&#39;t unusual, and that she had deliberately eaten food and drank plenty of liquids before she came so that it wouldn&#39;t be a problem.  Patient stated that she was fine and fit to drive and unconcerned about the reaction.

                                                Several days after recieving my Moderna vaccine, I began to feel itchiness in my feet. Within a few hours, the itchiness spread to my hands (both the tops of my hands and my palms). The itchiness spread to my wrists as well. By the morning of April 17th, I had swollen, red hives on my hands, wrists and feet. The itching was coupled with a burning feeling. Benadryl and Calamine lotion did not help. As the day continued, the hives spread to my ankles, knees and elbows. In the morning on Monday, April 19th I felt stiff (didn&#39;t know this was part of my reaction until my doctor asked me if I felt like my joints were stiff--I was too itchy to feel concerned about it), the bottoms of my feet were painful, and I could barely touch anything with my hands without it hurting. As the day continued, I became so uncomfortable between the itchiness and burning I decided to see my doctor.

                                                Had my shot at noon on 4/19, and around midnight or shortly after (at 1am-ish on 4/20) I had really terrible chills and was shaking, but my forehead felt hot, I felt quite nauseous, and I had a headache. I got out of bed and took my temperature using a thermometer and it was 100.6 degrees. Continued to feel bad until falling asleep around 3am, woke back up at 6am and took my temperature again and it was still feverish at 99.8 degrees. Woke up once more briefly at 11am but did not take temperature and fell back asleep. Finally woke up for the day at 3pm and fever had broken, temp was back down to normal at 98.5. Still felt a little nauseous but that was probably more from not having eaten all day! Now as of 4/21 I am back to normal. (If it helps for further info, I have also not to my knowledge contracted Covid before, and I had no adverse effects other than a very sore arm from my first shot. The second shot my arm was less sore but of course I was distracted by being actually sick. Also possible data to note is that the second shot felt like it hurt less and I got an unusual new bandaid type the pharmacist called an inject safe barrier bandage.)

The next day I noticed my body was achy, nothing too terrible, but there was some discomfort as well as feeling like my energy was completely depleted. By the evening the aches became terrible and I had also had chills badly. I had at some dinner, was fine at the time, woke up mid night and was extremely nauseous and ended up throwing up. By the middle of the night I had woke up completely drenched in sweat. Next day after I am fine, but still slightly achy.

Briefly this is a 23 yo female with unremarkable PMHx; Meds- OCPs; Allergies- PCN and Gluten. Pt received the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 12:25 PM with RN. Per RN report the patient informed her that she had a remote history of &#34;passing out&#34; after a vaccine as a child, but it had not happened recently.  The RN observed the patient at her vaccine station for 3 min then accompanied her to the observation area.  Per report of COVID-19 Patient Observer, pt was seen falling out of her chair in a seated position and it was unclear if she hit her head.  Per a witness, pt hit her head on the computer cart that was nearby.  The COVID-19 Patient Observer called for assistance and 911 was called.  She was immediately evaluated by COVID-19 Patient observer and RN and noted to be unresponsive initially.  The RN reported that she opened her eyes and became verbally responsive to verbal stimuli and touch.  Upon my arrival, pt was noted to be responsive and lying on floor on her abdomen.  She initially denied pain, but later complained of pain at crown of her head to touch.  Pt denied CP, HA, SOB, difficulty breathing, pruritis, rash, nausea, or visual disturbances.  Orthostatics were obtained (lying- 124/90-102; sitting- 137/81-115; Standing 123/87 - 96).  Patient maintained her O2 sat at 98% throughout the evaluation.  She was assisted to wheelchair and reported feeling better.   PE: A&amp;O x 3 HEENT: Normocephalic, tenderness to palpation at crown of head, no lacerations or bruising noted, pupils equal CV: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no M/R/G Resp: CTA B no W/R Ext: No UE or LE pain to palpation or edema noted  A/P: 23 yo s/p COVID-19 vaccine with likely vasovagal reaction and head trauma.    1.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on 4/25/2021 at 2:50pm. Patient was in observation area chair 1 and technician noticed she was pale in color and patient waved technician over to her.  Technician went to her and then alerted Pharmacist that patient was feeling light headed and was pale.  I went to patient and asked her how she was feeling and if she was having any trouble breathing. Patient was starting to slouch in her chair and I asked her if I could lower her to the ground.  At that time, she passed out and was unresponsive.  I lowered her to the floor and supported her head with my hand.  She was unresponsive for about 5-10 seconds but then her eyes popped open wide and she made a large gasping breath.  She was very disoriented and asked what happened.  As I talked to her and asked her questions, she became oriented with her surroundings and was able to verbally communicate with me how she was feeling.  Patient was reporting tingling in hands, heart racing, and was visually shaky.  I asked her if she wanted me to call EMS and she responded yes.  At this time, patient was beyond the 15 minutes post observation waiting period.   Technician called emergency number, I stayed on the ground with the patient and continued to assess her symptoms and her breathing.  The color in her face resumed to normal and she was able to use her cell phone to contact her father.  While sitting on the ground with her, she reported she was beginning to feel better, but was still feeling weird in her head.  At that time, EMS arrived and took over.

Pt was able to move to sit in chair outside of pharmacy for an additional 20 minutes after which she left the store feeling fine.

                                                After the first dose (end of March), I had a large red rash at the injection site which lasted almost two weeks.  After my second dose (April 20), I had an intense reaction. I was up most of the night freezing cold, leg hair standing on end, and body aching. Had to take a hot shower to cope with the chills. I finally fell asleep for two hours and woke up in hot sweats and an intense headache. I was fine by the afternoon, but developed a new and unusual symptom around 1pm -- sharp localized pains that would intermittently shoot through random parts of my body (mostly legs, but also arms and midsection). They were so bad I would keel over while standing and gasp. Each day since, they have lessened in intensity, but are still somewhat present (it is 11pm on April 26, one week later). Now, I have what I would describe as subtle, localized cramps (?) in random areas (calves, thigh, tricep, back) that come and go -- more of an ache-y sensation but widespread across my body. It is nothing I have experienced before, and only started after the vaccination.

                                                I have PCOS and only get my period every few months (approx 2-3 times a year). When it does finally come I have no bloating or breast pain, but I do get occasional cramping and very very heavy bleeding with many blood clots. My first period since the second dose has been incredibly light and the complete opposite of what it normally is. Brest pain, bloating and very light flow. No clots, no heavy flow, no cramping. I&#39;ve heard lots of other girls talk about how they&#39;ve had terrible periods after their second dose when they usually have normal ones so I figured I should report that I&#39;ve had the opposite effect.

Within 30 minutes, I was vomiting and went from being hot to shivering from chills. I didn?t  have a temperature reader, but I was fairly certain I was suffering from a fever. I continued to vomit and shake from chills until approximately 10am after taking Tylenol. From 10am to 11pm, I suffered from fatigue and body aches. I woke up at 11am 5/3/21 feeling no longer suffering from side effects. In addition to side effects after the vaccine, I was also suffering from head cold symptoms (sore throat, coughing, congestion). I had these symptoms start 4/30/21, so I tested for COVID-19 that day and my results came back negative.

She was found upright in her wheelchair, and appeared to have difficulty breathing. She was maintaining her airway, and did not have any oral secretions present. She appeared to be unresponsive with verbal communication, in addition to making eye contact. EMS called per family and nursing decision. Bilateral feet were placed on a nearby chair, and the patient remained upright in her wheelchair. Upon EMS arrival, patient was assisted into gurney with nursing assistance. All patient belongings were presented to the paramedics at this time. Family states that a similar event had occurred earlier during the day of receiving her vaccine around 10 am, and reported that she was able to &#34;get through it&#34;, and were on their way to obtain assistance for the event. The family suspects the event experienced today was not related to her receiving her second dose of the moderna vaccine today.

Most noticably has been the welt - uncomfortable to try and sleep. Itchy and achey. Applied cool lotion to try and sooth it, taken Ibuprofen and even tried gently holding a cool (unopened) can of soda to it when I had nothing else. Ongoings as of now (5/7/21) Been staying home a resting - wanted to do my part and fill this out.

                                                Woke up around 3AM in chills and a cold sweat. Was unable to fall back asleep until around 7:30AM--didn&#39;t check my temperature until about 8AM, and it was 103.4 degrees. My temperature peaked at 104.1 later that morning. I took Ibuprofen, stayed in bed, kept a cold cloth on my forehead, and drank a lot of water in the meantime. My fever started to come down in the afternoon, but did seem to climb if I wasn&#39;t adamant about keeping a cold cloth on my forehead--for example, it would come down to about 100, but if I took of the cloth for about 30 minutes, it started to climb back up toward 102. My fever seemed to break around 4 or 5PM, but I slept most of the day, so I don&#39;t have an exact time. After that, I had a little &#34;brain fog&#34; for the rest of the evening (Friday, April 7th), but when I woke Saturday (April 8th) I felt almost totally recovered.

Once patient started getting worse and started having visual changes with flashing lights, 911 was called immeidately and paramedics took over.

                                                Central Venous Sinus Thrombosis in Superior Sagittal Sinus  I arrived home at 12:38 on Sunday, 5/9, and opened the door to see my sister with facial droop, slurred speech and a contracted right hand/fingers. She was crying and immediately knew she was having a stroke. She had been trying to clasp some jewelry while getting ready for Mother&#39;s Day. She was able to walk down to the car with me no problem (no extremity involvement other than right hand/fingers). We arrived at the hospital within 10 minutes and she was a Code Stroke. A CT scan showed the clots as well as a tiny Subarachnoid bleed and she was admitted to NeuroICU. The symptoms waxed and waned for a few hours and at one point she developed the droop again, had headache and heartburn and vomited. A CT scan was repeated after some Heparin had entered her system and it was stable/not worse; subarach bleed was not changed and Heparin was continued.   She  has now been admitted for 3 days and the Heparin is complete. She is now being transitioned to oral Xaralto. She has no deficits whatsoever and has made a full recovery so far. We are still pending the results of her coagulation studies to see if she has a hereditary condition.   The doctors believe the clot is due to her Nuvaring Estrogen, which is most likely. However, I would still like to report this event just in case.

                                                Three hours after the second vaccine there was a soreness in my left arm, followed by a headache. The next day around 12:00pm, I started to experience swelling in my throat. The swelling made it difficult to breathe. About an hour later I experienced tightness in my chest, making it difficult to breathe again. I experienced shortness of breath and the tightening in my chest did not leave. I was able to make it more bearable by taking my inhaler, used for my asthma. Today (5/17), I am still experiencing tightness in my chest, although it is not as severe as it was yesterday. The swelling in my throat as disappeared today (5/17).

                                                Received the second dose Moderna at 11:00am. Then felt a little fatigue, didn?t think anything of it. Was fine until about 7/8 pm. Started to feel cold and got the chills. Then felt fatigue even more, but after taking Tylenol felt fine again. Next day, felt totally fine just a little fatigue and loss of appetite. But I notice a rash starts to appear on the arm I received the vaccine. And as time passes, the rash spreads to my entire body and even face. Went to the ER to figure out what it is and was given antibiotics so hopefully that works.

I made sure my blood pressure was stable (usually reading 128-135 systolic) and tried taking my propranolol for anxiety to stop the effect. Nothing really made it go away. This is not normal for me, but unfortunately I had to work so I worked through it. Would cause me to feel out of breath at times. It finally went away for the most part on the Monday of the next week, but it comes back occasionally.

                                                Fibromyalgia pain at all joints flared up to severe (level 10 of 10) pain for approximately 24 hours. Use of Cyclobenzaprine (muscle relaxer) had no affect in the first 12 hours. Aggressively treated with Tylenol and continued use of daily medications. Attempted to call doctor&#39;s office but was unable to receive further help. Resorted to attempting to sleep until pain levels decreased.

I put my fitness watch on to see my heart beat because I was feeling as breathless as after a very long run. My resting heart rate was jumping between 170-180 bpm. It subsided after roughly 15 minutes but my chest did remain tight.

I talked to patient and she is experiencing normal reactions (low grade fever, headache, chills) that are common with the COVID vaccination.

                                                The day following my vaccine in the afternoon I experienced bilateral paresthesia of the median nerve. Symptoms persisted for around 3 hours and resulted in me following up with a ER doctor via telehealth because of the concern of Guillian-Barre. Symptoms subsided with ice and did not reoccur. I was advised by mulitple doctors to not receive the second dose of the vaccine because of the inflammatory nerve reaction from the first.

                                                Initially had a very sore arm then during the night I woke up with hives all over my body. They were very itchy and red. I went to the medical clinic on Monday and attempted to use Pepcid, allegra, and Benadryl. That did not work so the following week I went and was prescribed an oral steroid, prednisone 10 mg Tabs pack 48s. During the course of the steroid the hives went away. Then after the steroid ended heartburn arose and the hives returned again all over my body and they also were on my lips. Went to the medical clinic again and the hives were combined with &#39;moderna arm&#39; however the moderna arm arose throughout my body and has consistently shown up since. Went to an allergist and was also placed on montelukast 10mg tablets. The hives continued, Benadryl, 24hr allegra, and 24 Zyrtec were used to lessen it but did not work. Now I have to take the biologic Zolair to take care of the hives and if I do not take the shot they come back every 4 weeks. The &#39;moderna arm&#39; rash has shown up consistently on both of my hands every morning then goes away later in the day.

She kept seated on her chair for 10 more mins, after which she felt like she was about to faint.  She walked up to me (pharmacist) for assistance, at which point she lost consciousness for a brief second. My colleague and I held her and we laid her down on the floor. As soon as she was laid down she vomited. Her vomit was bright red color with granular particles. To avoid her from chocking, I immediately rolled her over to the left side at which point she said she is okay and needed to get up. She said that she just had some flaming hot chips before coming to get the vaccine. She was given water to drink and a granola bar to eat and she was monitored for another 30 minutes without any further issues.

                                                Within a minute of administering the vaccine, the patient felt her arm where the injection was administered go numb. She also felt sporadic muscle spasms going down her feet. She said she started to feel dizzy, so we laid her down on the floor with her 2 feet up on a chair. She laid there for few minutes after which she said she felt better. She sat up on the floor and her B.P reading was taken. Her B.P reading read 88/68 mmHg. On further investigation she stated that she has a history of anemia, but hasn&#39;t been to a doctor in a few years. On the floor (concrete), her body started to shiver, so we moved her to a chair and she was given water to drink and a granola bar to eat. She was also given a blanket and some hot chocolate to drink. 15 minutes later, her B.P reading was checked again and it was 111/78mmHg. We monitored her for 30-40 minutes and after she felt back to normal she was asked to take some rest at home and follow up with a physician to make sure her Hemoglobin levels.

                                                I was vaccinated on 4/30/2021 at about 4PM and began having symptoms at about 3AM on 5/1/2021. At that time, I began shaking uncontrollably. I didn&#39;t have chills. It was as if I was sort of convulsing and my muscles were spasming. This lasted for about an hour. This has happened to me daily ever since I received the vaccine. The times vary now. Sometimes it&#39;s as brief as 30 minutes, other times it can last all day long. Sometimes my whole body spasms, other times, isolated areas (such as my leg or my back) will spasm. I have been to various care providers, and I am currently seeing a neurologist. On 5/6/2021, not only was I spasming, but the right side of my body went numb and I had chest pains. I went to the ER as a result.

                                                I received my vaccine on 1/8/2021 in the afternoon a few hours later I got a severe headache that was so bad I had difficulty seeing, it really felt like I got Covid again.  I had 12 visits to the ER and 2 admissions beginning on March 3/2021 and May 17, 2021, for various reasons included; severe headaches, loss of vision, pain in ears and spine, tingling in arms and legs, memory loss, fogginess, seizures.  It felt like my whole body was on fire. I think they did a Covid test on my 4th or 5th visit to the ED and it was negative. Sever depression to where i wanted to hurt myself. That has gotten better with medications. I am working minimal hours because you are on reduced schedule due to symptoms.

Around lunch today (01/04/21) I was moving my neck around and when I move it to the left it rolls over something. I began to feel around the area and noticed that where the sore area is I have a rather large knot. It is a hard knot that is very tender and sore. No other signs and symptoms present. I have not been to a doctor or clinic regarding the issue. I was unsure if this issue was directly related with the vaccine or not.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA; On 12/30/2020 I began experiencing soreness in my left arm along with a short period of chills and body aches. The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

                                                awoke at 2 am  with nausea, chills, generalized pain. Immediately felt myself start to pass out or have a seizure- I am not sure which. Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

Upon waking up the next morning (today) at 7am, I felt very weak. I ate breakfast by 8am and head to work. The weakness persisted, by 10am when I went to the restroom I felt as if i was going to collapse from how weak I felt while standing.  Felt some chills as if my chest was breathing in cold air. By 10:40am I was home in bed resting. Had a moderate headache and chills, weakness persisted. At 12:50pm I had  a fever of 100.9 F. I drank water, took 600mg ibuprofen and ate an orange. Around 2pm I felt strong enough to get up and take a short walk. At 3:00pm my temperature was 99.8 F, chills were gone. Weakness had improved. No more headache.  At 4:45pm temperature at 99.2 F. And feeling better. I took lunch around 3pm

                                                Almost 48 hours after the vaccine I woke up with hives flush to my skin along my R&amp;L arms, under my arms, on my left hand, insides of both thighs, and around my ankles. My skin felt hot but minimally itchy. The insides of my hands and burn when I wash them and they feel really sore. The bottoms of my feet also felt like they were burning when I took a shower. Nothing in my diet or hygiene products have changes. I took a half dose of Benadryl at 11am today and the hives are still there along with the pain in my hands when washing them. I coordinated with my PCP and they recommended self monitoring and Benadryl.

No history of anaphylaxis. She received vaccine at 5:42. Felt lightheaded and dizzy about 5 to 10 minutes after the vaccine. She noted chest tightness and tachycardia symptoms. We transported her via gurney to our observation area. She looked sleepy and had trouble arousing her. Blood pressure is 140/80, heart rate was in the 90s to 100s. Breath sound decreased bilaterally. No lip swelling. No rash. She noted throat felt uncomfortable.

Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

                                                ?Within the first 15 minutes - injection site felt hot (right arm).   ?Within the first hour - right arm felt heavy with some numbness/tingling that lasted less than 10 minutes.   ?3 hours post vaccine - mild arm soreness with ROM, but not to the touch.   ?7 hours post vaccine - I felt very fatigued. I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

                                                Shot given at noon- at 3:30PM I started having nausea, vomiting, headache, vertigo, muscle aches and feeling very tired. These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

                                                A few hours after the first dose (1/15), a welt grew around the injection site about the size of a silver dollar.  This went away after three days. Arm was sore for the first two days.  One week later (1/22), injection site became itchy, red and was very warm to the touch.  A welt formed as well. It started out the size of a silver dollar, and over the course of  48 hours the welt, itchiness, and redness grew to  the size of a large russet potato (Friday 1/22- Saturday1/23).  It was the most red around the injection site, with the most red being about the size of a silver dollar.  After 48 hours, it remained itchy, red, and had a welt  for the next 24 hours  (Sunday 1/24). The next morning (Monday 1/25) redness and swelling were gone but site was still a little itchy.  Site was only slightly tender throughout these three days but not painful. No other side effects were noticed i.e. fever, chills, chest pain.  Slight dizziness was felt if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything.

                                                When I was eating chips I wanted to lick my fingers and my mouth felt funny. I looked in the mirror and my face looked fine. The following day I noticed half of my face was paralyzed and I went to urgent care. The Dr. diagnosed me with Bells Palsy and put me on antibiotics for 10days. I asked for more because it wasn&#39;t healing, but hey didn&#39;t me anymore. Maybe a week after I did a phone visit and asked If I should get more medicine and they said no. Maybe a week ago from today 1/27/21 I seen my PCP and she contacted the Neurology department at medical center regarding  my situation. After about 3 weeks of having this im about 90% better.

                                                around 4AM of 01/06/21 (approximately 10 hours after receiving injection) I woke up with stomach cramps, feeling as if I needed to have a bowel movement which is extremely unusual at that hour. I went to the bathroom and ended up having extreme diarrhea. Went back to sleep, proceeded to wake up at 7am for work (I work at a hospital). Went to work, temperature upon arrival to work at 8am was 96.7. Didn&#39;t start to experience any other symptoms till around 10-11am. Developed a headache and thought, &#34;hm this is weird, I haven&#39;t had a headache since I had COVID but I hope it goes away soon.&#34; Then I went to lunch at noon and everything hit me all at the same time - freezing and sweating profusely, headache became so debilitating that it was burning/hurting my eyes, uncontrollably shaking, felt so weak (body aches all over, everything hurt). Took my temperature while I was at home for lunch and it was 101.5 and my heart rate was 160 (my heart rate is usually high because I take a stimulant but it is never that high). Went back to the hospital because I wanted to go to the ER and needed to get the rest of my belongings anyways. The ER physician and staff found the same things when doing initial vitals - high fever and heart rate. I made the ER physician aware of the fact that I had just received the vaccine the night before while also just having had COVID less than one month prior. I was instructed to go home at that point to get rest and recover. For the rest of the day on 01/6/21 and all of 01/7/21 I had to take off work because of adverse symptoms and effects. For all of 01/7/21 I was extremely fatigued and the headache never went away until 01/08/21.  On 01/08/21 I returned to work and symptoms diminished.

                                                Since I?ve gotten the vaccine, I have not taken a solid poop.  All of my bowel movements have been watery diarrhea. My appetite has gone down immensely, and when I DO eat, I immediately have diarrhea afterwards.  I have chills followed by feeling overheated.

                                                After about two hours my arm pain was so intense it felt like it was nearly broken and continued to feel worse. I had EXTREME headache and nausea which nearly led to vomiting but kept having to hold it down while alternating between Advil and Tylenol and Tums just to feel a little relief. Pain medications did not help substantially for the first 36 hours. I felt bed bound , had no energy to even move to pick up the TV control a few feet away from me. I had SEVERE chills, and still have them nearly 56 hours out with the headache and nausea still prevalent . I had such bad body aches and dizziness. Have had a hard time getting sleep because of the intensity of my symptoms. Absolutely has been the worst ever and I would NEVER get this shot again. Y?all need to do better. This is completely unacceptable for this to be side effects experienced by people even if it?s less than 10% experiencing the severity I felt. This is so messed up on so many levels. I?m going into medicine myself and although I believe in vaccines, this is not one I will be advocating for until research gets it together and provides a vaccine that is safer for people to receive. Completely anxious and worried and scared as to how my next few days and weeks will go especially with how severe my side effects have been and the news articles showing how some people seem to be dying within hours or days of the Moderna and Pfizer shots. Unacceptable. I can?t believe the amount of fear for my life I have right now.

Throat tightness, itchiness in scalp and groin, and difficulty concentrating (all my usual symptoms of anaphylaxis) occurred. Advised by health care provider to take Benadryl immediately and to have epi-pens on hand. Loratadine was prescribed.

Patient states she received the first dose of the Maderna vaccine in her left arm around 0910 hours this morning. Patient waited 15 minutes afterwards and within 30 minutes was back working in the trauma unit. However, she suddenly began to experience nausea, chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath, throat tightness, light headed, and overall shaky. Patient states she further went down to the vaccine clinic to inform them of her symptoms in which she was prompted to come to the ED for evaluation. She was not given an Epi pen prior to arrival. Patient reports overall feeling better now with only continued tingling in her tongue and fingers, as well as feeling mildly light headed. Patient also states her throat continues to feel tight, but denies any throat swelling. Chest tightness and palpitations have since improved, only with occasional flutters in her chest similar when feeling excited. Denies nausea, rash, itchy skin, or abdominal pain. No history of anaphylaxis or allergic reactions. Patient is prescribed Nexium, but denies taking any other daily medications.  Physical exam shows to be unremarkable with no rash or throat swelling/erythema. Patient does not appear in respiratory distress. Lung sounds are clear.   Will order an EKG. Will administer IV Epipen and IV Benadryl.   Differentials: Allergic Reaction   EKG shows NSR with sinus arrhythmia. Otherwise normal with a rate of 87 bpm.   Patient was observed in the ED for 3 hours with improvement of symptoms. Provided follow up instructions to clinic list. Discussed return precautions.

This was longer.  I had no control of my body, I was conscious the second time.  I attempted to tell myself to &#34;focus&#34; and try and find something with my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t; I was stuck in the state of my body shaking and unable to see anything. After the two times, I had the shakes.

When I finally got up to go to work, I felt dizzy and completely off balance, bumping into walls.  I  feel extremely nauseous, weak and have a migraine.

My upper body in general (from the waist up) it was very painful, very hard to carry stuff. The next day I started with nose bleeds. I was feeling a little dizzy throughout the day. I believe because of the blood loss (substantial). I had headache and felt nauseous throughout the day. The nose bleed was very very heavy, I don&#39;t have nose bleeds. It started getting better with each day and it lasted about 6 days.

By around 6:00pm on 01/31/2021, I started experiencing fatigued, what felt like a tension headache,  and cold to the point of shivering. I also started experiencing aching all over my body. At around 8:00pm, my body temperature was at 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit (sublingual measurement). By 10:00pm, my body temperature was 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit. I alternated between feeling really cold to feeling hot to the point of sweating through my sheets throughout the night.  I took an initial dose of acetaminophen 1000mg PO at  around 6pm, and continued taking an additional acetaminophen 500 mg PO every 2-3 hours until 4 am. In total, I took 3500mg of acetaminophen.   By 1pm on 02/01/2021, my flu-like symptoms had resolved. I continued to have a low level headache and a sore left arm until 02/02/2021.

                                                Monday morning woke up with arm soreness, headache, fatigue and feeling slightly warm. After a few hours, and a nap, I had a fever of 101.9 along with chills, severe fatigue and severe nausea.  After a 2 more hours my fever raised to 103.3, I had muscle cramping in my legs, nausea, headache and fatigue.  All of those symptoms lasted until 9pm that night when the fever resolved.  The following day I still had slight warmness, a temperature of 99 and headache, chills and fatigue/weakness.  All of those symptoms, continued until Thursday evening.  On Friday morning I woke up with no headache (only mild intermittent head pains), mild fatigue and arm soreness.  Every day this week my heartrate has been higher than normal with the average rate around 120-130BPM. This was at rest, without any caffeine or other stimulants.  I took alternating tylenol (1000mg) and ibuprofen (800mg) all 4 days.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                Starting around 9AM I began noticing a high heart rate while inactive. My heart rate was at 140 bpm (measured manually and with Watch). Normal for me is between 80-100 bpm. My heart rate remained high (between 120-140 bpm) for about 6 hours. I did not notice it go down to 100bpm until the next day. The high heart rate was never provoked by any physical activity. I rested in bed or in a chair all day and drank lots of water. Throughout the day I had fluctuating periods of feeling very hot and very cold. I took 1000mg of Tylenol every 4 hours throughout the day.  I also experienced expected side effects (chills, joint aches, muscle aches, nausea, headache, fever (100F w/ Tylenol)).

Upon slightest movement around arm, pain ensued even worse as is and did not allow sleep. Pain has  limited shoulder mobility for 2 weeks. Received Hydrocodeine-acetiminophen and Ibuprofen at ER on Monday January 25 for 3 days. Then, upon follow up with PCP, medication for pain relief was prescribed as followed: ibuprofen 800 mg and Gabapentin. Pain has subsided but remains upon slight movement of shoulder.

                                                The day after receiving the vaccine, my mouth and my face broke out in cold sores. I had my doctor call in Valaciclovir to help me get rid of them it was so bad. I took the Valaciclovir the day after my vaccine, on 1/16/21 and I was STILL breaking out in new cold sores a week later and had to take another dose of Valaciclovir.  My arm was so sore and I couldn&#39;t move it higher than my hip for two days. I was lethargic for two days and slept for a total of 40 hours over the course of the two days following injection. I also had a headache for about a week after the injection.

I took advil to combat it, which helped, but it always came back until around 7:00 PM the following day. Along with this, my body ached making it tough to move. Once these two side effects went away, the next two days consisted of a severe migraine when bending down and standing up. This particular side effect did not affect my daily life, though.

                                                I had on-and-off insomnia starting around 10pm. I woke up every thirty minutes on the minute with a feeling like there was a fifty pound vest on my body.  At 3:30, I felt nauseous. I walked from my bedroom to downstairs to the kitchen. My knees buckled several times en route. When I ate one bite of a protein bar, my nausea increased tenfold. I ask drank water at the time.   I walked back upstairs to my room to sleep where remained awake until ~five am. I slept from ~five am until approximately 8:10am. I felt faint as I walked into the bathroom where I felt my faintness increase by the second. My knees buckled and I passed out on the bathroom floor tile for ~five - ten seconds. I payed there for a few minutes until I felt stable to stand.   This morning, 45 hours after the injection and 22 hours after blacking out, I felt a goose egg on the back of my head. It has hurt all day at a level 4/10 on the pain scale.

Upon closer inspection, a lump slightly smaller in diameter than a baseball was visible in the area of soreness (underneath right armpit). The lump was noticeable by touch as well, but did not feel hard. It felt swollen but still fleshy. February 12: The soreness from the lump has subsided, but the lump is still present. The lump feels slightly smaller in size.

Was unable to get up from bed to take my temperature, Heart rate or blood pressure.  Called the emergency department to find out if I should go there. Shivering continued  for about 1 hour after taking Tylenol 1300 mg and clonazepam 0.25 mg for panic symptoms. I then slept for the remainder of the night and woke up with nervous system ?shock like? feelings of shivers and shaking.

Also experienced lethargy and nausea on the day after the vaccine. I did have GI upset immediately after and for a few hours after getting injection but that subsided overnight and I experienced some neck stiffness within an hour of the vaccine but that seemed to wear off through the day.  As of writing this (10:20 pm) I am still experiencing joint pain but it has decreased as well as muscle soreness; went from a 9 at the worst and is now a 3/4 and better with analgesics

                                                Around 5 pm on 2/11 (day of vaccination) I began to notice a very sore arm and dry mouth/dehydration. Drank water and continued as normal. Around 2 am of 2/12 I woke up with chills and had been sleeping very restlessly.  I had body aches in my arm, legs and back. Around 3am my temperature was 100.2. I also felt very faint when standing and thought I may pass out.  3 times when standing, I had to quickly sit down to avoid it. I do suffer from vasovagal syncope so this may be unrelated to vaccination. I took Tylenol and drank more water. Temp rose to about 100.6 before beginning to drop at around 4 am. I continued to take Tylenol every 4 hours and it helped keep temp below 100 but towards the end of the 4 hours, it would start to rise again. I ate normally and drank extra water due to feeling dehydrated still. Around 1 PM 2/12 I started to feel nauseous and had an upset stomach. I was still have a general body aches and elevated temperature around 99.5. My normal temp is usually about 98.0. Nausea led to diarrhea 1 time. Symptoms continued until approximately 8 pm when very quickly the body aches, nausea, fever and soreness in injection arm all went away. None of these symptoms have returned and it is now 2/13 at 8 pm.   I did test positive for Covid-19 on December 28, 2020 but have been fully recovered with no symptoms since 1/8/2021.

                                                Mild arm pain appeared immediately. From 12am - 4am I experience severe chills (despite putting on multiple layers and blankets) that caused me shiver so severely I felt like I was convulsing. No position was comfortable when lying down and nothing made the chills better. I also felt dehydrated, which is unusual for me. From 4am - 6:30am the symptoms reversed and I got extremely hot and uncomfortable. At 8am I noticed a prominent red, warm patch of  swelling around the injection site.

On the night after the vaccine, I could not sleep because in any way I would lay down the pains would cause my arm to tingle and then the pain was too much. It has been 2 days now and it still hurts to even lift a cup with that arm.

                                                the first day (1/16/21) following the first dose of the  vaccine, i began experiencing nausea. the third day (1/18/21) i vomited that morning once but then not again throughout that day.  after that for about two weeks, i was just generally nauseous and also had no appetite. food tasted off to me. this went away after two weeks, but then i got my second dose on 2/12/21. on 2/13/21, i spent about 12 vomiting very consistently, about every 10-15 minutes. i also had chills alternating with profuse sweating and hot flashes, but did not ever have a fever. other symptoms included headache, extreme fatigue, dizziness, body aches, shortness of breath, and chest pains. the next day, i was fine aside from some slight lingering nausea but no vomiting. since then, i have experienced nausea intermittently every day, and have vomited on more than a dozen of those days. i have no appetite, and have now lost ten pounds since getting the second dose. i realized that my main food aversion is to meat, i will vomit every single time i eat meat now. i?m not sure if this is my reaction to the texture and taste like i think it is, or if it?s actually more like an allergic response by my stomach. i also still struggle with shortness of breath and feeling like my chest is tight, as well as dizziness and a nagging cough.

I woke up at 1am with a temp of 102.7, drenched in sweat, and shaking so badly my partner thought I was having a seizure. I did not seek treatment, because I was able to sleep after taking Tylenol and having my partner use cold washcloths and ice packs on my neck, forehead, back, and chest. I also attempted to take a shower, but I was so weak I required assistance to walk to the bathroom. I had similar side effects the next night although less intense.

                                                I had no immediate reactions to the vaccine. About an hour after my injection I developed a low grade headache. The next day, 2/26, I woke at 7am with a headache still. The headache and fatigue worsened through the day (2/26/21).  Around 3:00pm I started experiencing waves of dizziness. By 4pm I had begun experiencing temporary loss of feeling in  various body parts. Each part&#39;s loss of feeling came and went separately and lasted about 2-5 minutes each. I experienced this in my left facial cheek, both wrists and hands, and my right hip. I had a coworker drive me home and by 5pm I had a migraine with severe sinus/head pressure and a fever of 99.4. My average resting body temperature is 97.4. I slept from 6:00pm friday till 10:30am on Saturday (2/27). When I woke I still had a headache, but no longer a migraine.  I spent 2/27 dizzy, weak, and achy but no more episodes of lack of feeling in body parts or a fever.  I have not experienced soreness in the arm I got my injection in, but I noticed on Tuesday March 2nd that I my injection site is very swollen, red and itchy. The swelling and redness (to my knowledge) has not gotten worse or better since then, but the itching has gotten worse and the actual puncture wound is now visible since yesterday (3/4) whereas it was not visible anytime  before  that.

I woke up super nauseous at 4:00am and quickly vomited afterwards. From there on I slept for 10-30 minutes in between vomiting for 3 hours.

Then later in the evening at around 4 pm began feeling muscle spasms in my chest and abdomen area which I had not experienced before, so around 7:30pm I went to the hospital for treatment and was given ibuprofen again and also a lidocaine cocktail which relieved my symptoms.

My whole body (muscles) felt sore and I felt sick-ish  with body fatigue, headache, body soreness (I felt like how one might feel on day 2 or 3 of having a cold.) I only threw up twice in the morning between the hours of 8am and 10am, and I didn&#39;t throw up nor did I feel nauseous the rest of the day.  I rested and ate plain foods and felt much better the next day.

I went to bed and my body wouldn?t warm up under the covers. I woke up around 1:16am feeling very hot. I was running a fever of about 102F. After removing the covers and using a cold compress it dropped to the 99F range and fluctuated quickly between about 98.7F-99.9F. I continued to have chills and feel very cold during this fluctuation. When I would stand to go to the bathroom my body would be very weak and I would get almost lightheaded.  I fell asleep by about 3:30am. The following morning my fever was completely resolved. I continued to feel weak during the first half of the day with some mild intermittent nausea. By the second half of the day my side effects resolved entirely.

Cold ice pack was held to the shoulder ~8 pm for about 15-20 minutes to try to reduce the swelling, with no observable effect. Swelling had stopped by 3/13/2021 upon waking up. Redness around the vaccine site in approximately an oval with max diameter of ~ 3 inches was noticed on the night of 3/12/2021 and was similarly red throughout the entirety of 3/13/2021. The site of the vaccine was slightly itchy and tender. By 3/14/2021 the redness was mostly gone, with the diameter reduced to ~1 inch and looking more brown than red (like an old bruise).

                                                I have had floaters in my eyes since the vaccine. I started to use  refreshing eye drops on Saturday March 13. I am not sure if the acne cream got in my eye the night before the vaccine. it is called Retin A cream 0.025%. I have also been feeling very weak. I got a B12 injection on my butt for energy(Friday, march 12). My legs feel like they are in pain and the hurt when I walk. I also had a lot of pelvic pain after the vitamin injection. I drank ibuprofen March 14 at night. I woke up feeling very weak. Before going to bed on March 15 I drank Tylenol. I still feel pain in my legs today and now I have lower back pain.

This progressively got worse during the day, including a hard lump and was itchy. Approx. 6 hours later, I became fatigued and had body aches all over. At 30 hours post second vaccine, I started to run a temperature. It got up to 101.5 F, I took Tylenol and went to sleep. By the morning, it was gone. The next 2 days, I had a headache and very sore arm. On day 3 I developed a very sore armpit/under arm area on the same arm as I received the vaccine. As I&#39;m writing this (4 days later), my arm is still sore &amp; itchy and my underarm area is still sore, but no fatigue or fever.

No loss of breathing or swallowing. Pt took 25mg of Benadryl which stopped the swelling within the hour.  By 20 minutes, left side of face from top of head to collarbone became numb which persisted over the next 72 hours, with numbness/discomfort lasting through the week after the injection (today is 1 week). Twitching of fingers, arms, and legs also began around minute 20 and subsided about an hour after injection. No weakness of muscles or droopiness. Pt also experienced severe pain at injection site over the following 48 hours, immobilizing the left arm.

                                                Mild muscle soreness in right arm (injection site) beginning within an hour post-injection, noticeable with movement. Took 400mg of ibuprofen before bed.  At 10.5 hours post-injection (middle of night), right arm soreness was moderate-to-severe at rest and severe, almost unbearable, with movement. Mild muscle soreness and joint pain were present throughout the body; joint pain (wrist, elbows, and knees) was an issue prior to injection and was exacerbated during the event.  I also experienced chills and sharp headache pains. Took 400mg of ibuprofen, 1000mg of acetaminophen, and secured right arm with a pillow, which allowed me to fall back asleep.   At 17.5 hours (following morning), muscle soreness was present in right arm alone and was mild at rest, moderate with movement. All other symptoms were gone. Experienced fatigue that afternoon (approx. 24 hours post-injection), treated effectively with a short nap and vitamin D (through sun exposure).  On the 2nd full day post-injection, right arm muscle soreness is minimal with movement.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  Around 4 in the afternoon I started getting more intense pain in left arm.  By 5 PM I was starting to get mild nerve pain in the same arm, and the pain had spread from my left arm to include my neck and upper shoulder.  By 8 PM the nerve pain was getting worse and the muscular pain had spread to 2 inches bellow my shoulder blade (concentrated on the left side) and included the aforementioned areas. At 11 PM I noticed that my sense of touch was altered on the left side of my body, and the nerve pain was steadily getting worse.  I could feel pressure but not fine discriminative touch, and had little reaction to touch (I usually have a lot of hypersensitivity, and react very strongly to the slightest amount of touch). I tried going to bed around 12:30 AM but was not able to fall asleep until after 5:30 AM because the nerve pain was so sever at this point.  Positional changes and ice did not help, and I ended up taking Advil at 5:15 because I couldn&#39;t deal with the pain anymore.  This dampened the pain enough that I was able to go to sleep at 5:30 AM. The nerve pain was a 8/10 and went down my ulna to my 4 and 5th fingers.  This was some of the worst pain I have experienced in years. I have some lingering nerve pain in that arm (as well as dampened sensory sensation on the left side), but it is not as bad as it was the night of the vaccine.

About 30 mins after the vaccination I started getting a headache that turned into a migraine within the hour and did not respond to over the counter treatments (alieve, excedrine) nor did it respond to my second course treatments from the neurologist (as I get chronic migraines), such as triptans (imitrex, and today I tried amerge). I just wanted to report these symptoms to a) increase awareness of negative side effects in populations of the chronically ill and b) provide information that could alter the vaccination&#39;s preparation so others may not have to suffer the same side effects in the future.

However, one week after the injection I developed a rash on the side of my arm near the injection that is causing pain and swelling. The rash is continuing to grow.

                                                One week after the injection I started developing a rash that started out the size of a quarter and has been getting increasingly worse since it developed 4 days ago.  The rash is now larger than a softball and is swollen, red and itchy. Along with the rash I have been increasingly experiencing shortness of breath when talking, clammy skin, excessive sweating, body aches, and fatigue. The bottoms of my feet have also been itchy. I have been taking Pepcid and Benadryl which have helped to alleviate symptoms. I contacted my primary care doctor and hope to speak with her in the next 24-48 hours.

                                                A few minutes after the shot, at the base of my pinky and ringer finger on my right hand, i felt a slight cramping that got more noticable in my ring finger. This went away after an hour. Then a few hours later the same thing happen in my left arm. That also resolved in a few hours. 26 hours after my shot, at just before 1:00pm the following day, I felt the subtle cramping at the base of my pinky and ringer finger on my left hand. This has lasted for a half an hour.   Other than the above, I have experienced fatigue, pain at injection site, slight nose congestion, and dry throat/slight throat discomfort (i.e. feeling dry and only slightly swollen or congested)

She stayed under observation for a while and was told to call her doctor if any symptom progressed. She was called at 7:00pm and said she had also experienced a slight tightness in her throat. She took one dose of Benadryl. She called her primary care MD and they advised her to go to the ER if the symptoms worsened.

No medication was taken to combat the symptoms. Overall it was manageable, but I have never experienced something like that after a vaccine injection.

She was nervous leading up to the vaccination, but seemed ok right after.  She regained consciousness quickly and was a bit disoriented.  She proceeded to drink some water and sit for a while.  After 15-20 minutes she looked much better and alert.  She was unable to get someone to pick her up, but waited for 30-40 min after the event before she felt confident to drive.  She stated that she had eaten breakfast and it was the first time she had every passed out before.  She said a cold feeling came over her and she just went dark.

I began sweating and my skin was very red. However I also had not had any food up to this point and believe it may have been caused by my sugar bottoming out. I left after about an hour under observations. It has been about 2 hours since the shot and I still feel light headed and a little fatigue.

She then felt like she was going to pass out, so we sat in the floor with her and she passed out for about 30 seconds. She then came to and slowly cooled off and started feeling better. She sat with us for 45 minutes and then felt well enough to leave with her mother.

HOURS 12-24: By 4 am I was shivering, fevered, and aching enough to officially call out of work, though there was no coughing (and honestly that made me wonder if i was being a wuss, but the next day, the difference was real). The rest of the day was mostly aching and chills, with rest when possible. I felt distinct sluggishness. Bright light or changing orientation too quickly resulted in headaches and squints. My lips were dry even though i had been downing water constantly, thank you fever. Very light eating the whole day, dry toast, pretzels, etc..  HOURS 24-36: Felt vaguely crummy throughout the rest of the evening. After sleeping the next night through i felt great, and even exercised before work.

After 5 days of growing, it went away overnight. I used warm compresses to help.

                                                On Sunday after the injection, my left deltoid muscle was sore but manageable. On Sunday night, the deltoid was very tender and my body was sore. On Monday I feel fatigue and body soreness all day. On Tuesday my body aches and arm soreness was minimal or gone, but I developed a rash on my left arm in the bend of my elbow around 5PM. The rash was itchy and looked similar to an eczema outbreak. The rash on Tuesday went away after a few hours. On Wednesday morning the rash was popping up on different parts of my body and is very red and itchy. The rashes are about the size of my hand and located on my right leg behind my knee and inside of my thigh, my entire left arm, and the right side and back of my neck and my right shoulder.

Checked fitbit and had been tachy since 2am. Went to ER. Migraine reached 7/10 intensity, was brought down to a 5/10 with 30mL liquid tylenol and two zofran (unknown strength). Was given 1L saline at 400mL/hour. Tachycardia lasted 14hrs before we got it back under 100bpm. During ER visit felt feverish but temp was not rechecked after triage. Checked at home and was 99.1°F (high for me as I don&#39;t get fevers). This broke overnight and did not have a recurrence of tachycardia episode. Continued tylenol for 3 more days, migraine was slowly lessening. As of today I still have a headache but it does not warrant tylenol.  I was treated at the ER by a Dr., who diagnosed me with a post-vaccination reaction and stated my POTS likely was why I had such a strong tachycardic response.

Then on Wednesday, the lightly tingly feeling is now both sides. My upper cheek areas are slightly swollen as well. I can still function, but I am concerned about this side effect to the vaccine as it wasn&#39;t documented. Or if it&#39;s an allergic reaction.

                                                That evening my arm swelled up and became very painful - not as much as the first vaccine. I had a hard time sleeping - nausea and headache throughout the  night. 4/3 - extremely tired; felt like I couldn&#39;t get enough air (shortness of breath) body aches and muscles aches - over all lethargic. 4/4 - I was dizzy, short of breath . Those two symptoms lasted along with fatigue - which lasted for two days. I almost passed out that day - everything went black and I had to be assisted to the couch to recover from that.  I used Tylenol for my symptoms when needed.   I still have ongoing headaches - three weeks ago (about a week after I got the vaccine) - I noticed I was having ongoing headaches and I still have these.  Pregnancy - 2nd pregnancy; 1st one was full term. Date of delivery expected - September 9, 2021.

I have had a green small bruise the whole week from the shot, but the red circles didn&#39;t show up until a week later. They only lasted for about 24 hours before they faded away. I also had some irritation in the arm pit area of the same arm I got the shot in during the week after getting the shot.

On the second day 5/11 I took the bandaid off and noticed that it was red underneath the bandaid. The soreness had gone down, but I noticed a new swelling, slight itchiness and heat coming from the spot. The swelling was bulbous and round around my shoulder muscle. If the swelling or soreness doesn&#39;t go down by tomorrow, I might make an appointment to see a doctor.

I experienced chills and hot flashes on and off. I also experienced fatigue and weakness. These symptoms persisted throughout Friday (my vaccine was Thursday).  Ibuprofen helped ease the symptoms. I felt mostly normal on Saturday, with some lingering back pain and fatigue.

                                                I didn?t mention a side effect from my first shot because I didn?t realize it at the time I filled out the survey. Immediately after my first shot I experienced distorted tastes and smells. Lots of food still (after 5 weeks) taste nasty to me. Meats, fruits, and more. Hard to describe the smell and taste, sometimes soapy. My reactions to the second shot similar to first. Cold chills achey, feel really hot, fever, tingly arm, etc.

                                                Nothing for the day after the injection. At night, started to have some chills, could not sleep.  I took a Paracetamol 500.  I am breastfeeding my 5 month old daughter, so sleep is already  broken up but I can normally sleep soundly between each feed.   In the middle of the night, i had a mild fever and troubles walking 5m.  In the morning (05/21/21), I took a paracetamol 500, still had fever, migraine, chills, and was generally very weak.  At 2pm, I took a paracetamol 1g and at 2.30pm, my temperature under the arm was 37.8°C.  Thanks to the paracetamol the fever went down but I still a a strong migraine.  8pm, temperature at 38.4 under the armpit, took paracetamol 1g.  Fever and chills went down,  still had the migraine and nausea.  05/22/21: 2am, chills and general pain, took a paracetamol 1g.  Could sleep 8am, no fever still headache.  Migraine and nausea all day.  10pm, no symptoms anymore except for the muscular pain in the right arm when the injection was done.  05/23/21. Only subsides the muscular pain in the right arm.

                                                It started out with vomiting and fever and then really bad stomach pains. Stomach pains after anything I ate or drank. That happened for a couple of days. Then I had blood in my stool and it was like diarrhea. So I went to the ER on 02/09/2021 and they gave me a CAT scan and said there might have been some kind of colitis. Referred me to a specialist. Right after I went home and two days later I went back to the ER with even worse pain. Had blood in my vomit and was kept there for a couple of hours. They again referred me to another gastro appointment. I wasn&#39;t able to get into a gastro appointment until 02/26/2021 I believe. When I saw the specialist they said that my symptoms had to do with Colitis. Symptoms worsened and I was admitted again. Became to weak and couldn&#39;t walk. I lost like 15lbs. Sched for 03/08/2021 was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. I was point on medication and put on medical leave for three weeks. I started mesalamine treatment. That didnt work so now im on a biological treatment for every 8 weeks or until further notice.  REMICADE is what I was prescribed. My iron levels had dropped and I had to get two iron treatments through I.V. as well. Seen hematologist

Patient describes her symptoms as if she is having a normal menstrual cycle.  This patient uses Nexplanon for contraception successfully without a menstrual cycle for the past 2 years.  Denies other urinary or vaginal symptoms, or possibility that she may be pregnant.  Although there is high suspicion that this is a COVID-19 vaccine side effect, I will evaluate for abnormal anovulatory uterine bleeding with labs and follow-up with ulatrasound if her symptoms do not resolve with time.    24yo female with left sided supraclavicular lymphadenopathy presenting within 24hrs of her 1st and 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Patient endorses waning symptoms after the first dose until she received the second dose at which point the lymph node came back.  Physical exam remarkable for one 1x1cm left sided supraclavicular lymph node tender to palpation.  Likely reactive lymphadenopathy.  I will treat with watchful waiting given reactive lymphadenopathy to include supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is a known side effect of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and that patient&#39;s young age and lack of risk factors.  If persistent over several months I will re-evaluate the lymph node with imaging.

I said, no and asked if she was ok. She said yes, but that she was really hot. I got a fan for her and had her sit infront of the fan for the rest of the 15 min. After 15 min, she said she was fine and felt fine to leave. I told her she could stay as long as she wanted to/needed to; but she said that wasn&#39;t necessary and she felt fine, and she left.

I heard my dead cat screaming for me, and then later I heard my mother panicked and calling for me to help her (when I went to the opposite side of the house where she lives, she was fast asleep and had not called for me); the next two days I was shivering the entire day, barely able to stand, and incredibly nauseated. My arm also hurt to the point that moving it caused me to cry out in pain. There was no noticeable swelling at the sight at any point.

                                                I was pregnant at the time of my first and second dose of the vaccine. My estimated due date was February 15th 2022. A half hour after my second dose I had a little bit of spotting and moderate to severe cramping. This was dismissed as gas pains. Later that night I went to the bathroom to find a substantial amount of blood in my underwear at which point I called a nurse line and was directed to go to the ER. They gave an ultrasound and ran blood work. Miscarriage was strongly suspected but not totally confirmed. I was also running a low fever and experiencing severe chills, muscle and joint pain and a severe headache. I was sent home and told to follow up with my doctor for more blood work to confirm the miscarriage. I continued to get severe cramping, bleeding and loss of uterine tissue vaginally. On Monday I saw my doctor had blood work and confirmed the miscarriage. I am still bleeding today.

The fever continued for several hours, breaking around 3 or 4 in the morning. I woke up at 6 am with a severe migraine and was very nauseated. I also had diarrhea throughout the morning. My arm was also extremely sore and sensitive. I took Excedrin for the migraine, and woke up at 10 am feeling somewhat better. I remained shaky and fatigued throughout the rest of the day. The next day I still felt fatigued with a slight headache.

                                                I had pain in my left arm, and within an hour or two I was pretty exhausted and out of it. I figured it would go away, it got worse the next day, and finally on Saturday when I woke up it was hard for me to breathe and I had pain/tightness in my chest. I went into the ER on Sunday morning and after a day of testing was diagnosed with: - Deep vein thrombosis of bilateral lower extremities - Pulmonary embolism, bilateral - DVT, bilateral lower limbs  I had at least 5 clots in my legs and several more in my lungs but they said there was no way to know the full amount. I had been on HRT for over two and a half years and had no problems, then 4 days after I received my first shot I was informed that I had almost died several times due to the clots. When I explained to my doctor that I thought the clots were related to my shot he shrugged it off, said it was impossible, told it was just my hormones, and said that &#34;Covid is no big deal and we&#39;re overexaggerating how bad it is compared to other things...&#34;. So I don&#39;t think any of this was reported.   Later I saw a blood specialist who told me it was impossible for hormones to do this much damage in the span of a few days without something else effecting it, and told me to cancel my next shot even after we learned I had APS. All and all I would really appreciate someone looking into this to at least make sure there isn&#39;t something else going on, as the timing of this is was too close and I know Covid shots have had the rare chance of causing the exact kind of thing I went through.

On the morning of 4/19, I woke up with sharp and stabbing chest pain which radiated to my back. I was unable to take full breaths. This chest pain continued for two weeks. In addition to the chest pain and inability to take a full breath, I also felt chest discomfort, like my chest was full of something. Wooziness (feeling like I?m going to faint), weakness, and heart palpitations also accompanied my symptoms. Sometimes, my heart palpitations s are so bad that it shocks my body. These symptoms are still here, 2 months after getting my first shot.

We gave her some water and she sat down for about 20 minutes, said she felt like she was going to faint. we sat her down in the back on the floor and her dad came to get her. They left and ended up going to the ER because the numbness started spreading to her leg and she said she had trouble walking.

By the time RPh grabbed the epi pen and was next to the pt, within 15 seconds since pt passed out, the pt was consious.  no epi pen was administed. pt reports having stress induced seizures from time to time and believes this is what happened. pt was placed into a chair about 2 minutes after passing out. pt reports she hit the back of her head and was given a cold pack. pt arranged for family to pick her up from store. does not appear to be caused by vaccine, pt may have been stressed by getting a vaccine and needles. no further issues or concerns arose.

It felt just like a cold. I got tested. I tested positive for COVID. I had a fever that whole night. The next day was the worse, super congested, headache, fever on and off the whole day. I was okay after a few days. I took Tylenol.

                                                A few moments after getting Moderna vaccination, patient reported not feeling well. After asking a few questions, patient stated that she had fainted after shots before and had a severe fear of needles. We recommended that she stay seated in the IMZ room rather than getting up to wait in the waiting area. Her hands began to quiver and her head started to slump. I held her shoulders so she would not fall and asked if she was ok. She said she wanted to lie down.  Her friend and I were able to gently lower her to the ground.  She appeared to pass out for a brief moment, then awoke and was able to answer questions but still did not feel well.  We raised her feet and offered to call 911 for evaluation. Patient felt continually better over the next 30 minutes.  We checked her blood pressure and it was low.  We rechecked about every 5-7 minutes and it was climbing.  After feeling better for awhile, we helped her into a chair to see if she was well enough to go home.  She mentioned that she had started feeling ill again.  We checked her blood pressure and it had dropped again.  She started feeling better within a few seconds and 5 minutes later her blood pressure was back up.  Eventually she felt well and headed home with her companion who was very attentive.

I am type 1 diabetic. So basically after getting my first dose of moderna my blood glucose has been really high. I am also very tired.

                                                A patient received a covid vaccination today and passed out. The technician had administered the vaccine and then had the patient meet another technician at the counseling window to schedule her second shot. As they were finishing up, she became lightheaded and fell. She hit her head on the floor and rolled over and had a seizure for a few seconds.  The pharmacist saw her fall and went out and tended to her. One technician called EMS and another got an ice pack and cold water for her. She came to fairly quick but was disoriented and didn&#39;t remember what happened. We advised she wait for EMS to check her out and she agreed. We had her wait in the room until they arrived.   She was checked out and signed a form as to not receive treatment. She told me she would follow up with her doctor and would also ask about her second shot. I informed her it might be advisable to receive in office.

This morning (next day) I am still having muscle soreness so I will probably take another 1 g of Tylenol.

Was evaluated by ED doctor and ED attending and was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Neurology consulted. Steroids were not recommended as it would make vaccine not effective. Lyme test was obtained (reported negative). Was discharged later on 1/5/2021 and was advised to follow up with OMS and neurology.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? The day I got the vaccine all that happened was a dead arm and then when I was driving home after the 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The next day my arm was sore to move, but not at the injection spot, if looking at my arm (someone else) it was down 3 inches and to the left about 1 inch. The next day that same spot was still sore but to the touch, then it went away.    What is more interesting and concerning is that on 1/6/2021 (a week after I got the shot), I noticed 3 little bumps on my arm (9:45pm), in that same location that was sore to move and touch on day 2 and 3 but they also were itchy. When I woke up the next morning (6:15 am) the area had spread to the size of my palm (3 inch by 3 inch roughly)  it was all red, hard to the touch,  stilly itchy and I had the feeling of a dead arm again. One of the nurses at my work drew a circle around the red spot so we could watch to see if it was still growing , by roughly 11:45 am it had grown an additional 2 inches.

I started to feel chills and back pain around 7 pm.  Throughout the night my arm was throbbing and I had a hard time sleeping. I woke up around 12 am to use the restroom. My body felt VERY heavy and weak. I woke up today (1 day after the shot) and felt better.  However, my arm still has severe pain and I experiencing fatigue. I also feel like the back pain goes in and out.

However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

Unsure of exact vaccination date and onset of symptoms.  really having to focus to place hands under water to wash them, walking through doors without bumping into them, turning on faucet, getting dressed; left hand is worse than right and not able to easily align things properly;  &#34;feels like her brain isn&#39;t doing what she&#39;s telling it to do&#34;.  Aunt said the symptoms are not improving. Patient had tested negative for Covid the day she got the vaccine.

The vaccine was administered to my left arm without complication at approximately 1:00pm (my scheduled appointment). I proceeded to the area designated for patients to be observed after receiving the vaccine and was asked to wait 15 minutes. I recall getting to the observation area then telling my spouse I felt unwell - after the event he notified me that I told him I was about to pass out and asked him to get medical help. I lost consciousness approximately 5-10 minutes following the vaccine. My husband reported that after losing consciousness I seemed to have a minor seizure, as evidenced by my head jerking and my arms and fingers &#34;tensing and curling up&#34;.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of my car at this time, so I suffered no fall or fall related injury. Public health officials and EMT responded. They indicated to my spouse that I had experienced a vasovagal syncope episode and that I had &#34;gone tonic&#34;/ had a &#34;tonic seizure&#34;.  They took my blood pressure, which was very low (I don&#39;t recall exactly but it was 80 over something). They also took my blood sugar among other things that I do not recall.  I was given oxygen and put into an ambulance. I was shaking, so they wrapped me in blankets. I believe they may have done an EKG and placed a blood pressure cuff while I was in the ambulance, but I do not recall any specifics about this. The EMT also drew my blood, placed an IV, and administered IV fluids while I was in the ambulance. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency department

                                                Arm became incredibly sore about 4 hours after injection.  The soreness was so intense that I felt nauseous when I moved my arm or bumped the injection site. About 11 hours after the injection a severe headache began. Roughly 19 hours after the injection muscle fatigue and overall tiredness began, headache remained as well as arm soreness. About 30 hours after the injection all the symptoms above were present in addition to a fever. Currently it is about 54 hours after the injection and only a slight headache and slight arm soreness remain.

                                                strong shivering occurred around 10:00pm at night. I got out of bed and felt very cold and began shivering. I went back into bed at about 10:40pm still shivering. When I woke up around 3 or 4  in the morning I was no longer experiencing the shivers.   The following day on Friday, I felt fatigued, but it was hard  to tell what from, because I was also experiencing the first day of my menses.  The fatigue felt different because it was my entire body as opposed to the fatigue I feel just in my legs during my menstruation.

By 11:30pm I could not move my arm and also could not pick my son up who  weighs 30 pounds. On the following day I continued with severe  body aches  and joint pain. I went to see a doctor about 10:00am who examined me and advised my to take Tylenol and Ibuprofen  for pain.  They did a Covid-19 swab which as negative.  My symptoms are improving and I can say that it took about 24 to 48 hours to recover from my right arm.

                                                Several minutes after the vaccine she became light headed, EMT evaluated her and stated she was tachycardic (did not give a pulse) and was initially unable to find a BP.  She appeared pale and was crying and hyperventilating.  She stated she had a funny feeling in her throat and numbness in her fingers.  We prepared to administer an epi-pen but she was increasingly anxious so we had to place her in a supine position first.  Immediately she started to feel better, her color was normal and her blood pressure was 110/70 with a pulse of 67.  Her throat no longer felt ?funny.?  We continued to monitor her and did NOT administer epinephrine.  An ambulance arrived and she was ambulatory and feeling normal so declined transport. Follow-up with patient 1/18/21, she states she is feeling good. She said she and her mother both have a history of passing out with any procedure involving needles and she does not feel her symptoms were caused by the vaccine itself. She plans to receive her scheduled 2nd dose from us.

                                                Upon receiving the vaccination the onset of nausea, migraine, and arm aches were experienced. Several hours later the aches moved to upper body aches causing pain breathing. Upon night, dizziness had set in. I fell unconscious hitting my head and received treatment for a concussion. I am currently pending a CT Scan to check for brain bleeding.

Pt then stated that both sides of her throat felt blocked and gave consent for epinephrine injection. RN administered 0.3 mg epinephrine and activated EMS. Vitals signs, breathing and circulation monitored closely until EMS arrival. Pt was transported by ambulance to the hospital emergency department for evaluation.

                                                About 30 min after the vaccination I felt dizzy. It felt almost like I had gotten up too quickly and felt dizzy, that kind of dizziness. Lots of soreness on the injection site the day of the vaccination and also going down the arm if I tried to lift my arm it was painful, everything else was fine until 4:30PM when I started feeling chills and feverish. Around 9PM the cold chills were so awful I started crying because it was so uncomfortable. I took some Tylenol and it knocked me out. I felt cold and hot during the night. About 7AM the next morning I had hives, on my chest, arms and legs (red itchy, swollen) the chills have gone away in the morning. I took an Allegra around 8AM and it did work after 30 min to an hour. Then I went to see my allergist around 11AM and  the itchiness and redness had gone down a lot but the itchiness was still there. The allergist told me to take some more Allegra that day and it ended up working.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

It was somewhat itchy for 2 days, and continue to grew in size for 4 days. The rash was improved by taking over the counter allergy medicine (Allegra 24 hour). It was slightly raised and swollen the first 2 days, but decreased over the following days although the rash itself got larger.  I did not seek medical attention because I did not have any other symptoms or side effects with the rash, and was able to self-treat with allergy meds.

BS was checked and was low so I was given crackers and a sprite. I was severly nauseaed and HR elevated to 150 with SOB associated and was like that off and on for about 30 minutes which prompted EMS to be called to come check me out and was transported to the ED.  I was given fluids and my lab work showed I was deydrated. UA neg, Triponin-neg, EKG-tackycardia and they symptoms deminished on its on after about 4-5 hours and I was released from the ED.

I took my temp and it was 100.3F . I starred with body aches and I took a Tylenol. My fever was gone about 3AM next morning and I was able to sleep the rest of the night and when I woke up I was very tired, no fever and just body aches. About 8 or 9PM the next day I was feeling normal again.

                                                The day after the vaccine I started spotting  and my back started getting numbness down my legs. I kept moving my legs because I was afraid I was going to lose feeling in them. I got an X-ray and it showed there is nothing wrong with my back and I concluded it has to be from the vaccine because it has resolved for the most part after 3 weeks. I was extremely fatigued for 3 days and my left cervical and right axillary lymph  nodes were swollen. I had a huge welt at the injection site for 2 weeks and now there?s still a bruise there. I am afraid to get my second vaccine because I don?t want to lose feeling in my legs. I need guidance from someone who knows a lot about this vaccine because no one is able to give me guidance.

Patient expressed no adverse effects when contacted two days post injection other than soreness of arms.

                                                I woke up at 8:30 am and had the sensation of floating and the world around me was spinning. I went back to sleep and did not awake until noon. When I got up, I felt very weak and my head was foggy. I also kept stumbling when I walked. I drank plenty of water in case I was dehydrated and ate protein, but these symptoms lasted the entire day. The next morning I woke up with a mild headache but mostly felt normal.

                                                Approximately five minutes after receiving the shot, I began to feel a burst of pain rush through my entire left arm. A few seconds afterwards, I started to feel nauseated. Immediately, I felt weak, light-headed, and tired. I began to sweat profusely, as well. I could barely move my arm to flag down one of attendants who was monitoring us. She asked me what was wrong, and I tried to describe what was going on, but I could barely talk or keep my eyes open. She radioed for help and the paramedics came over to me. They wanted to move me to a private room and asked if I could walk. I tried to walk there, but I started to fall so one of the paramedics hoisted me up to help me. They asked me some questions will they were waiting for a stretcher, all of which I could hear and understand, but I was unable to response to. The stretcher came and I laid down, but I was already starting to feel better by then. I was very out of it, but I think this entire process took maybe 10-15 minutes. I laid there for maybe another 15 minutes, and I began to be able to talk again and open my eyes. I tried sitting up and that went alright. I answered some questions for them while they took my blood pressure, monitored my pulse, and took my temperature. After another 15 minutes or so, I felt well enough to walk back to my office in the Health Department. I didn&#39;t have any other problems for the rest of the day.

                                                About one hour after injection: I had a burning sensation in chest and throat and swelling feeling; I felt a bit of throat swelling. I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

On 2/3 my arm felt very warm, so I looked at it in a mirror and found a large, round/hexagonal area of swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness. Today is 2/6 and it continues to spread the redness, swelling, and warmth down towards my elbow. It occasionally itches, but is usually painful and stings.

My 9pm I felt dizzy, had a headache, and started feeling nauseous  I took some Tylenol and ibuprofen and a snack (can?t take it on an empty stomach when nauseous  Was able to fall sleep but woke up at 2am very shaky, nauseous, and with extreme joint pain. I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 21 Jan 2021, approximately two hours prior to the start of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 032L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Approximately two hours after receiving the vaccine at 12:30 pm, the patient experienced heavy feeling in her neck and face area that hurt really bad. Later, she noticed numbness in her hands and feet. Slurred speech was reported from a bystander. By 3:30pm, the patient was completely paralyzed on her right side. She was taken to the hospital, and a code stroke was initiated; however, all labs were normal.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient was still paralyzed on her right side, unable to walk, had shooting pain feeling, and two fingers on her right hand were able to move but still felt tingly. The doctors planned to discharge her on the next day to a rehab center because she could not function alone.  Treatment for the event included pain medication and hospitalization.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly, unable to walk and shooting pain feelings were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 25-year-old, female, patient, who experienced heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly and shooting pain feelings. The events of heavy feeling in her neck and face area, numbness in her hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 032L20A, expiration date unknown). The events of inability to walk, had shooting pain feeling and two fingers on her right hand were able to move but still felt tingly occurred the following day after the vaccine administration. Treatment included pain medication and outcome is unknown. Based on the information provided, which indicates a strong temporal association between the reported events and administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine (onset latency of 2 hours), a causal association cannot be excluded.

                                                Arm pain developed throughout the day starting 4 hours post vaccination administration. That pain then spread to my upper back alongside a mild headache. I was otherwise well until 12.5 hours post the vaccine where I developed fever and debilitating chills which went on for the remainder of the night. I had full body aches and immense pain in my arm, and kind of a stiffness all over my body accompanied by fatigue which may just be due to the lack of restful sleep I obtained. I also had a loss of appetite. I took 2 advil the next moring and felt better within 2 hours and regained my appetite. The sweating from what I presume to be fever still hadn&#39;t subsided nor had the chills. I would say within 36 hours all that remains is mild arm pain.

My arm was very swollen, red, and painful. I also had a reaction to my first vaccine lot #011J20A where 8 days after the dose my arm had a red rash, very swollen, hot to the touch, and painful. This reaction took about 5 days to go away.

I was so light headed I thought I would pass out if I stood up. I went to ER - Dr thought it was  from my wearing personal protection equipment - mask and goggles for work after receiving the vaccine. He told me I was fine but I was so much in  pain that I was too out of it to ask for tests. I was in pain for two week. Chest was in pain.  I had to use my inhaler once a day at least - sometimes more.

                                                A few days after the shot I had a horrible headache behind the ear and right side of forehead that wouldn&#39;t go away with tylenol for about 3 days. 1 week after the vaccine I had routine blood drawn, afterwards ate breakfast and had jaw pain and couldn&#39;t open my mouth fully. Within a few hours my whole right side of my face was weak. I was able to get into the dr at 2 pm and was prescribed antiviral Valtrex and pregnozone for 1 week. Started taking them immediately and doing facial excersizes. No improvement so far.

She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

                                                My arm started hurting very bad after about 2-3 hours. At the 12 hour mark from my vaccine (11:30PM), I started to have chills, a fever, and feel nauseous. Around 1 AM I started to vomit and this occurred for about 15 minutes, and then repeated again about an hour later. By the morning of the day after I was no longer vomiting or had chills but still had a fever. The most prominent symptoms on the day after my vaccine were extreme body aches and horrible joint pain. My hands and feet felt swollen and stiff. I had terrible pains and aches in my whole entire body. I was also very tired and still had a low grade fever. On the second day after the vaccine I had bad chest and neck pain and started to have a mild cough. By the third day after the vaccine, the chest pain was gone but still had bad neck pain and a headache that radiated through my skull.

Once before bed, and once when I woke up.

I noticed swelling in my arm and began taking Ibuprofen.  Sometimes my arm would begin to &#34;wake up&#34; and my whole are would tingle. On 3/7/2021 I developed a red area around the injection site and my arm swelling was more pronounced.  My arm also feels hot somtimes.    I have continued to take Ibuprofen and place ice on my arm in the evening.  I continue to have the swelling, hot arm, red patch, and pain in my arm as of today.  The &#34;numb&#34; feeling is something that comes and goes.

                                                Initially sore arm and chills around 8pm. Around 2 am notes Fever, chills, body aches all over, a killer headache, nausea and I could not stay asleep. I took 2 extra strength Tylenol at that time, put an ice pack on my forehead, and drank a Pedialyte.   In addition to those, at about 4 I had ringing in my left ear and then lost the hearing in it. I just went to bed. When I woke up, around 10am on Friday, I could hear, but super dizzy. I couldn?t really walk without  feeling like I?m going to fall over, especially with turns. All symptoms continued throughout all of Friday.  I continued to take the Tylenol per the instructions on the bottle with my last dose around 5pm, I also drank 3 more pedialytes throughout the day in addition to plenty of other fluids. Took a warm shower around 7PM which seemed to help some with body aches and chills, however, dizziness/vertigo remained.  Saturday I woke up several times drenched in sweat. Around 9am my fever was gone. Still feeling a little ?off? in terms of balance/vertigo but nothing compared to Friday.  Slight body aches remain. Other symptoms gone.

                                                When originally obtaining the vaccine, I had little side effect; the only thing I noticed was a slight fever for a few hours and a sore arm for a few days. 8 days after the shot was given, I developed a small swollen welt at the site of injection. I thought it may have been a mosquito bite, as I had spent the evening outside. That evening, I kept an eye on the swelling, and it was about the size of a half-dollar coin by the time I went to bed. When I woke up throughout the night (this is normal, as my sleeping patterns are irregular) I noticed more soreness in my arm. When I awoke for the day, the swelling had grown to be about the size of my hand. It is now sorer, and somewhat itchy, but I am managing with ibuprofen.

                                                Around 6:00 pm on the day of vaccination I started to feel very fatigued and developed body aches - this felt similar to the beginning of developing Covid-19 symptoms. (I had Covid-19 back in November of 2020)   Around 8:00 pm I had developed some head congestion and swollen lymph nodes along with some throat pain and sinus congestion - again feeling very similar to Covid-19 symptoms.   Around 10:00 pm as I was heading to bed the symptoms became  a lot worse, I had pretty intense body aches and started to experience chills as well as a slight fever (around 99.5 in F). At this time the symptoms felt similar to how I had felt during the worst of my previous Covid-19 symptoms, very weak and achy, headache was very bad, and felt very uncomfortable overall.   Around 2:00 am on March 13 I woke up with a fever of 101.8. The previous symptoms had also gotten worse, I was having a hard time getting out of bed because things were very uncomfortable, I drank a lot of water and took some ibuprofen to combat the fever, about an hour after this the fever had come down to about 99.9 and I was able to fall asleep, but before taking the medication I couldn&#39;t have fallen asleep because of the discomfort of the aches, chills, and fever.   Throughout the following day I was unable to complete many of my day to day activities without taking a daytime cold and flu medication. With the medication I still felt sick but was able to walk around and complete some simple household chores, this carried through into the evening, when the medication wore off the chills and aches and headache were much worse and I still had a fever around 99-100. That night I was able to sleep with the cold and flu medication taken right before bed.  Upon waking up the next morning (March 14) I still had some congestion, headache, and general discomfort but the worst of the aches were gone and I no longer had a fever, these symptoms continued to diminish throughout the day.   On March 15 and March 16th I have had a slight lingering congestion headache, this also feels really similar to the lingering headache I had upon recovering from Covid-19. It is not debilitating and is continuing to improve. Otherwise I am feeling healthy again and have been able to complete my usual activities and even exercise.   Overall the symptoms felt like a couple days of having Covid-19 again, but recovery was much faster, and it was definitely worth receiving that first dose of the vaccine and getting started with the process of doing my part to reduce community spread.

                                                Pt received 2nd COVID vaccination at 1024. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have dropped her water bottle and become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, she was noted to have moderate pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted. Her head was aligned/adjusted to maintain an open airway. Pt noted to have some muscular rigidity and not verbally responsive. Another provider advised to call 911 due to unresponsiveness and seizure-like activity. 911 called @1027, meanwhile pt lifted and placed into a wheelchair and moved to treatment area where vitals were obtained, patient became verbally responsive @1034, responses/speech was clear but slow, pt was oriented to self, place, time and situation. Oxygen applied via facemask @4L. Pt provided staff with phone number to call her mother who was notified of daughter&#39;s condition @1032. FD Engine arrival @1033 report given and pt also became more responsive, eyes opened and stated clearly that she was feeling better. Pt color also improved. Pt denied any allergies, PMH or hx of seizure activity. Pt only reported a syncope many years ago. Ambulance arrival @1036, report provided to emergency staff and pt taken to ambulance for further evaluation @1039. Pt returned to vaccine clinic @1052, having declined ambulance transport. When asked about events, pt stated that upon sitting down she felt a sudden onset of moderate nausea and reached for her water bottle in her bookbag, pt states she could not recall or hear anything until she was moved to wheelchair, and did not recall how she came to be in the observation area (based on this information, suspected time unconscious was approx 6-12 seconds). Pt was educated regarding the many causes of syncope and the neccesity for further evaluation in the Emergency department. Pt discouraged from driving herself from the clinic and was able to obtain ride from her roommate. Pt urged again to obtain a ride to the hospital for further evaluation, understanding verbalized and agreed with plan of care.

General malaise, low grade fever. Site reaction spread down arm, went to urgent care &amp; was told it may be cellulitis &amp; was given antibiotics &amp; told to go to ER if it continued to spread. It spread outside of line that was drawn the next day so I went to ER. They did nothing &amp; told me remain on antibiotics &amp; to see allergist &amp; PCP. Reaction continued to spread, arm/hand numbness &amp; general feeling of illness, slight fever continued for approx. 2 weeks following vaccine. Site reaction fully subsided visually by 1/26 (began 1/15). Allergist suggested it was severe immune reaction to vaccine. Felt generally unwell for approx. 5 weeks following vaccine. Was told I should not get second dose or any covid/flu vaccines in the future. I have history of poor reaction to vaccines/site reactions.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I noticed extreme tiredness and light headedness. I got up to notify staff and my vision went and I began to feel nauseated. They helped me to a seat and I began sweating profusely and the nausea intensified. After several minutes the nausea and vision changes subsided and I continued to feel extremely tired and light headed.  The staff put a heart rate monitor on me and I saw that my heart rate was sitting around 38-42. I felt like I just wanted to close my eyes but the staff kept asking me questions. After several more minutes a cop arrived. Later on an ambulance arrived and when they put the blood pressure cuff on I noticed tingling in my hand from it. I continued to feel light headed and extremely tired through arriving at the hospital via ambulance around 10:30am. These symptoms gradually subsided throughout the afternoon leaving me with light headedness  only when walking or moving around. While at the hospital they did an EKG which showed inverted T waves (from what I remember of the PA&#39;s description) and so admitted me for observation and performed an echo which came back normal. I was discharged around 10pm on the same night.

                                                Fever, aches: began at 10 pm the same day of vaccination. The fever and aches responded well to Tylenol. Fever lasted from about 10 pm to 3 pm the following day and then stopped, without the use of medicine. However, the fever and aches later came back that night (3/20, the day after vaccination) at around 10 pm.  Vomiting: Certainly the effect that caught me most off guard. Vomiting lasted from 4:30 pm on 3/20 (day after vaccination) until 7:30 pm that same day. I vomited 5 times in this time span, and was quite nauseous for about an hour or two before the vomiting began. No medicine relieved this effect.  Headache: Came and went with the fever. Not too terrible.  Sore arm: lasted for about 30 hours after the injection.

Helped her to safety without any injury and observed until symptoms resolved in a few minutes. By the time 911 crew arrived, she was doing good and feeling much better. She did not lose consciousness at any time during the adverse event and after 911 crew arrived. she informed she does not have any chest pain and she was doing well and does not need to be referred to a hospital or her PCP. 911 crew left without any treatment. I called the patient today again at 07:45 PM and she stated she is perfectly fine.

I was tired. I got a really bad headache that evening and I took Tylenol for it. When I went to sleep, I didn&#39;t have a temperature - at one point - it was 96. something. All night I felt hot and feverish internally. I had body aches, groggy, tired and my muscles hurt like I&#39;d worked out - for the next three days. I felt feverish randomly for the next couple of days as well. The facial numbness only lasted about an hour. Still am  experiencing irritation under my axilla from the first reaction to the vaccine.

                                                I felt arm pain in my left arm Around 4:00 pm, I started reaching for my face but I could not feel my face - it felt numb and tingly. That went on for two hours. There was no other droopiness juts facial numbness. My arm pain lasted for a good three weeks. It caused the lymph nodes under my armpit to swell. The pain went from my axilla Lymph nodes down to my left breast.  I got a pinkish, reddish, itchy rash at the spot on the injection about a week later. I don&#39;t recall the date for the doctor visits - one telehealth and one in person. They wanted me to use Primrose oil to massage the oil. They told me to keep an eye on it. I still continue to get the pain under my arm pit from time to time. I have still been seeing physician about that.

                                                Almost immediately felt warm sensation in left forearm near the elbow that started to become itchy. Then, a day later I noticed my arm was swelling about 3-5 inches from the injection site. Where it was swelling it became red, hard, and warm to the touch. My arm continued to itch in the said area and the size and symptoms persisted for about 2 weeks. I started doing cold compresses and taking Tylenol after week 2, the symptoms seemed to slowly subside over about 3-4 days. I total it took about 2 and a half weeks to rid of the side effects.

Spoke to Shelly at IDPH, she stated let the client know, report as a vaccine error, and do not give her the 2nd Moderna vaccine, she is considered &#34;complete.&#34;  I let the client know, she was fine with this.

                                                I got my period out of the blue the following morning. It was the worst period / PMS of my life. I was having full blown contractions, waves of pain and heat so much that I was throwing up. I also had diarrhea and very heavy bleeding. Once I was able to keep ibuprofen down I was absolutely fine and the symptoms dissipated. In total this pain, vomiting and diarrhea, unable to think or drink water or communicate lasted about 2 hours.

It felt like my heart was beating irregular, vision went blury, full body flush, skin was hot,  my chest was heavy and I had shortness of breath. I told the staff that I was having a reaction so they had me sit in a private room and watched me. After sitting for a few minutes the feeling went away. I have not had any side effects since.

                                                These were symptoms after 2nd shot.  I started with a mild headache and sore arm. Then things got worse. At night on Wednesday, 24th, I got a severe headache that was at the back of my neck and could feel in the back of my head. Then I became so achy. My bones and joints hurt so much. It hurt to sit or lay down. All I could feel is the pain in my joints. I became so weak and so achy that I could barely get up and walk to the restroom. I could it stand for more than 2 minutes due to the pain. The subsided slightly on Thursday night, 25th, at 6pm. But then returned in another way. I became very nauseous and dizzy. My muscles instead of my bones began to hurt extremely. I could barely move. I broke down crying a couple of times due to the pain being so intense. Throughout this time, I did try to eat or snack and continue to drink water and Gatorade.  Then finally the pain just all of a sudden went away on Friday, 26th, at 1:00pm. I felt like a different person. The pain was gone. The only lingering effect was when I would get up from sitting down, I would be dizzy and my head would throb for a few seconds. That went away on Saturday night, 27th.  I will say if that type of pain had continued on much longer, I might have had my husband take me to the Emergency Room.

Her vision blurred; she felt dizzy; she had a hard time hearing herself, although she could hear me fine; and she felt faint.  We had her sit back down and got her some water, checking on her every 5 minutes or so.  She was still dizzy, but not as faint.  She also reported a cold sweat.  We got her some orange juice and continued checking on her.  She called her husband to come and get her.  She was able to get up and walk out of her own accord with her husband.  We will follow up with her tonight to see how she is doing.

                                                I got the shot and waited the 30 minutes since I tend to have adverse reactions, but nothing noticeable happened. I went to get a donut, drop something off with my partner&#39;s sister, then home to take a nap. All I had that day was a donut and water. When I woke up about 4-5 hours later my throat felt tight and like a more mild anaphylactic reaction than my really severe hospital one to triptans. I calmly went downstairs and took benadryl and waited around my partner a to see if it would improve which it did.  It ended up going away and I though nothing of it the rest of the day. I just had a sore arm for the next two days.  I also ate the rest of the donuts the following days and didn&#39;t have any reactions.

                                                Injection site immediately grew a red spot after vaccination. This spot turned into hard red bump with a hight temperature that was painful to the touch. Over the course of the next 10 days, the bump increased in size until it was about 5 inches in diameter. On day 9, the swelling and hardness went away but the arm became numb. On day 10, arm feels heavy and sluggish, but the spot has begun fading away from red but is showing a purplish tint growing in it&#39;s spot.

I decided to drink some orange juice and when I went to sit back down I started feeling extremely dizzy, I got a very bitter taste in my mouth, my whole body started tingling and my lips and tongue and hands especially started feeling numb.I managed to get to bathroom floor where I grabbed some water and wiped it over my neck but I continued to feel worse where I couldn?t even control what my body was doing and I had diarrhea. The ?snow? in front of my eyes got worse too where I couldn?t almost see anything for over probably 3 minutes and I broke in cold sweat.After the diarrhea I had a very sharp pain in my lower abdomen. That all lasted a few minutes and I didn?t have phone on me and I was alone so I helplessly sat on the floor through it all til I started feeling bit by bit better.The fever continued for 48 hours as well as extreme arm pain for 3 days where I got my vaccine.

                                                I received the injection in my shoulder joint and immediately I knew something was wrong. It was not in the deltoid and was extremely painful. It felt like someone was shoving a pencil in my arm. Since then, I have experienced a loss of ROM and severe pain (all over my upper arm constantly with a shooting pain if I try to move my arm). I am in extreme pain and still cannot move my arm.  I have tried doing some range of motion exercises, but it is not helping. The pain is keeping me from sleeping and working. I went to my primary care doctor and they said the symptoms would go away in a week, but I am very worried that it would be a SIRVA issue.

My muscles were weak and it was hard to move. I then vomited twice. This lasted until I fell asleep on the floor, perhaps 45 minutes. When I awoke 2 hours later, the dizziness and weakness subsided.

Around 5pm the day after my shot I had a 101 degree fever, a headache and still the severe back pain. I took Tylenol when I noticed I had a fever and went to sleep. I felt much better on Saturday the 10th, two days after my covid shot, but I did notice redness around the injection sight and still had a slight headache and fatigued.

                                                Pain throughout upper arm started within the hour. Chills and low grade fever started at 2am and lasted for about 4hrs. Felt fatigued throughout the day and slightly dizzy, but felt much better. At 4pm, the fatigue increased and the chills/fever/aches returned. Fever went up to 102.5 and came down slightly with ibuprofen. As of 8:30pm, still feverish, achy, and cold.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, the arm it was given to me in was basically dead - very weak, achy, hand couldn&#39;t really grip anything. About 3 minutes after, I was very dizzy and sweaty, and a bit nauseated. Felt like I might pass out.  Starting about 11 hours after the vaccine, and lasting almost 3 days, I had: Extreme body pain, much worse than usual (I have chronic illnesses and I&#39;m always in pain) and more widespread. Low fever. Tiredness.  The hand on the arm where I received dose one of the vaccine still doesn&#39;t have its strength back almost 4 weeks later - can&#39;t open bottles or spray hairspray.  Cannot consume things with bergamot anymore - 1 week following the vaccine I tried to drink a tea that I drink weekly that has bergamot in it. Became incredibly dizzy, there was nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating. Tried it again a week later and had the same reaction. Decided I&#39;d wait until a month after the SECOND dose before trying it again, so may still be sensitive.

Fever was gone by the morning but I had to take it around the clock for about 48 hours or else the body aches and chills would set back in.

                                                Fainted; Arm soreness; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of SYNCOPE (Fainted) in a 25-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 030M20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medical history reported.).    On 02-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm soreness). On 08-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Fainted) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 05-Apr-2021, PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm soreness) had resolved. At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (Fainted) outcome was unknown. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Blood test: normal.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  Treatment medication included Ibuprofen. On 08-APR-2021, patient fainted at the work place. Patient was seen by the HCP on the same day and they did some blood work and all the blood work reports came within normal limits. So the HCP mentioned that possibly it could be a delayed reaction to vaccine and suggested to call the manufacturer and report it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The headache felt like a migraine, but went away with the Tylenol. I could not think straight all day.; 24 hours later (Day 2, mid day): threw up once, felt like I could not walk 10 feet without overdoing it. Motion made the nausea worse.; 30 hours later (Day 2, afternoon): took pepto bismol for the nausea. This helped reduce the nausea, but I was still queasy; 32 hours later (Day 2, evening): headache came back. Took 2 extra strength Tylenol to treat. Still very fatigued. I did not feel like I could get out of bed.; 44 hours later(Day3, morning): woke up with a headache, fatigue, and nausea. At this point, I could keep down water, pedialyte, and saltine crackers. Took 2 extra strength Tylenol to treat the headache. Still could not think straight; (Day3, mid-day): Tired, nausea going away (Day4): Neck pain, could not think straight, tired, appetite coming back (Day5): Tired but mostly back to normal The arm pain was bad days 1-2 but got better on day 3. This was way worse than any time I have ever had the flu or pneumonia. I have never been so fatigued that I felt like I could not walk anywhere. The nausea and fatigue were inhibiting to daily activities.

                                                I received my vaccine in the evening and felt alright until I woke up the next morning. I typically do chores first thing on Saturdays, so I got up to do my chores and recognized that I needed to lay down less than 10 minutes into cleaning the kitchen. I felt weak, slightly dizzy, achy, and had a mild headache. I laid there from 7:30am-6:30pm only getting up to potty. I drank 100&#43; oz of water and a large energy drink while in bed. Over the course of the day, the headache is what became unbearable. My sinuses filled up and it turned into a migraine around 3pm. I had rice around 10am so my partner made me soup with a baguette at 6:30. I ended up calling my dad at 6:30, a 30&#43; year Hospital CEO, to confirm that taking a tylenol would be okay. He said it would be fine. When I took it, I felt better within 20 minutes. Within an hour I felt like I only had allergies. I was eating and watching TV. However, I was tired and wouldn&#39;t have walked far. The next morning I woke up with a severe enough headache that I took a tylenol and drank a coffee (I hear caffeine expedites medication) and by 10am I was at a hardware store buying stuff for house projects.

The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was on an unknown date and the estimated date of delivery was 15-Nov-2021. On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant). 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MALAISE (General sick and tired feeling), FEELING ABNORMAL (Did not want to get out of bed), FATIGUE (Pretty tired) and HEADACHE (Headache). On 22-Mar-2021, the patient experienced VAGINAL HAEMORRHAGE (Menstrual bleeding). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FOETAL GROWTH ABNORMALITY (Baby had not grown). On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarried) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FOETAL HEART RATE ABNORMAL (No fetal heartbeat.) and HEREDITARY DISORDER (Genetic issue). On 12-Mar-2021, EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant) had resolved. On 09-Apr-2021, ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarried), FOETAL GROWTH ABNORMALITY (Baby had not grown) and FOETAL HEART RATE ABNORMAL (No fetal heartbeat.) had resolved. At the time of the report, VAGINAL HAEMORRHAGE (Menstrual bleeding), MALAISE (General sick and tired feeling), FEELING ABNORMAL (Did not want to get out of bed), HEREDITARY DISORDER (Genetic issue), FATIGUE (Pretty tired) and HEADACHE (Headache) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, Ultrasound foetal abnormal: abnormal (abnormal) Had some bleeding and found out it was subchorionic hemorrhage. Bleeding is in another part of the uterus where is baby is not. On 01-Apr-2021, Ultrasound scan: abnormal (abnormal) Saw baby heartbeat but was informed baby had not grown.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment information provided mentioned ultrasound and cytotec.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable as patient took both doses of the vaccine. Patient reported that she does not blame Moderna, as her OB feels the miscarriage was related to a &#34;genetic issue.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-060699 (Patient Link).   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 13-Apr-2021: Patient updated AE and mentions fetal complications resulting in miscarriage. Events and outcome of case thus updated with new information.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the temporal association between the product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The area was swollen, as well as the under arm (lymph node?). Red mark has gotten larger over the course of the day, still swollen, tender, and hot to the touch. No other side effects, other than neck and hip pain the Monday after, but I am unsure it is related. The neck pain limited movement when trying to turn my chin over my right shoulder. The joint pain has gone away.

I went to work and later started feeling pain under my eyes in my sinuses where I also noticed swelling. It is now the next day (2 days after the vaccine) and the pain and swelling has not gone away.

                                                Arm pain, arm swelling, bruising at the site of the injection, loss of grip strength in injection arm, all within 10 minutes of vaccination. Within a few hours, tiredness set in, additional loss of grip strength in both hands, but especially in the arm that received the vaccination. 9 hours after the shot, severe fatigue set in, as well as hot and cold flashes, switching between fever and chills, headache, excessive sweating, weakness, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, body aches, skin pain, and flare-ups of old injuries. I woke with tremendous, debilitating neck pain as well, which was the site of previous whiplash injuries, in both my neck and lower back, and my knees hurt as well. Woke every hour or so throughout the night, severe symptoms. By the next morning after the shot, the fever and chills had stopped, as well as the nausea and vomiting. Fatigue remained, headache on and off, and body aches. By day 3 most symptoms had gone away except for tiredness. By day 4 I started to notice sun sensitivity, and on day 6 have developed what seems to be a heat rash? My forearms are hot, red, sensitive, and reactive as well. Every day since the shot I have gotten tired in the afternoon as well, even if earlier in the day I felt OK. Have had mild shortness of breath in addition, but nothing that has stopped me from regular activity. As a 25 year old, I experienced incredibly severe symptoms, and this was my first shot of Moderna. No known previous exposure to Covid, either. Noticed that symptoms started worsening rapidly around 6 p.m. the day of my shot after taking my borth control pill as well. Wondering if related, or possibly coincidence.

Symptoms included dizziness  with the feeling of loss of balance while seated. I felt weak and couldn&#39;t lift my hand up. Fast heart rate: it felt like my heart was beating in my mouth. My throat (underneath the chin area) felt hot and later elevated to a burning sensation under my skin. Symptoms lasted for 30 seconds to less than a minute. Symptoms gradually reduced and once past the 15 minutes observation window, I mentioned these symptoms and asked if I was free to go. Since I felt alright and didn&#39;t need EMS to check with me, they let me drive back home. I have not experienced any other side effect post this event.

This  joint pain then resulted in tingling in my hands, which made my arm feel weird. Almost numb. Sometimes my face feels a bit numb too. My heart rate was elevated.

                                                4/19 I developed severe hives/rash all over my skin and inside my throat. I felt weak and tired. My throat was also swollen. This reaction is still continuing today 4/30, and I do  not know when it will end. I have been to urgent care twice for steroids, I have taken Benadryl, and Zyrtec but nothing will fully get rid of the reaction. I visited an allergist on 4/29 and she believes that I am having an adverse reaction to the vaccine. She prescribed several antihistamines to counter my reaction to the vaccine, including bendaryl, famotidine, fexofenadine, zyrtec, and an epipen incase my throat starts to close.

She went on to have typical side effects (fever, muscle pain, injection site reaction) over the past 3 days, However today when she presented at the pharmacy she said the reaction in her left arm where the vaccine was given had continued to grow worse. She described it as hot, painful and hard to the touch, She also relayed she had been experiencing significant muscle pain only in that arm (the entire arm) as well as some numbness in her left hand and wrist. She did indicate she had previously had an issue with numbness that had since resolved and could not say definitely it was related to the vaccination.

We gave her 50mg of Benadryl and sat her down to observe her. She said that her symptoms somewhat resembled what she experiences in an episode of POTS but she never had the tongue numbness or chest pain before.  When talking to us she could not make eye contact and her responses were slow but clear. Within the next 15 minutes her symptoms did not improve and she stated her right hand felt numb. We called 911. The EMTs said all her vitals were good but they took her to the closest ER.

Patient noticed central chest pain on the second night after the vaccine as well as vague flu like symptoms, bone pain, fatigue and stomach ache. Symptoms all resolved shortly after 2am and have not returned today. Patient recently had covid back in March. Suspect over-reaction to vaccination due to remaining antibodies from recent covid infection. Chest pain likely pleurisy due to location indicated and stable vital signs and no cardiac risk.

                                                Last Friday I started feeling a burning sensation on the lateral side of my right breast, the opposite side of my injection site. The next day I had what looked like a mosquito bite on the right side of my back, in the next couple of days it spread along my back all the way to the side of my breast and into my sternum all on the right side of my body. The rash now small blisters are painful and itchy.

                                                Confusion/inability to complete tasks: within 20 minutes of getting my vaccine, I was unsafe to drive (drove on the wrong side of the road). Within 2 hours, I could no longer focus enough to work (I&#39;m an engineer). It&#39;s been 6 days since my shot and I&#39;m still confused, forgetful, unable to focus, and unsafe to drive. I forget steps during work tasks, and forget what I&#39;m doing while I&#39;m doing it. It&#39;s like a short term/prospective memory issue. Lack of coordination: 5 days after shot, could not navigate stairs without assistance. Could not remember ADL (did I get mail, did I eat, did I shower, day of week...) Fatigue: Slept/ rested all day for 2 days after the shot. It&#39;s now 6 days after the shot and I&#39;m still unusually tired, needing 2-6 extra hours of rest a day. It&#39;s tiring to walk short distances, to focus/converse, to work. Sore arm: my arm was very sore for 2 days after the shot (painful at rest, worse if touched, like a bruise). By 4 days after the shot, it was not sore even if pressed/hugged. I do not have any headache.

                                                Patient is a 25 year old female. She presented to the clinic for her second dose of Moderna LOT #003C21A.  According to patient&#39;s husband she has no significant past medical history but has ?passed out? with vaccines.  No reaction noted with her first COVID vaccine.  Approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection today she told her husband that she wasn?t feeling well.  She said was light headed and nauseated.  Patient then proceeded to become nonresponsive.  Her eyes deviated upward and her whole body became stiff.  Her skin had notable pallor.  She was lowered to the ground by staff, myself, and her husband, and put in a supine position with her legs elevated.  911 was called. This episode lasted approximately 40-60 seconds when she became responsive and cried out for husband.  Her muscles relaxed and she became notably upset.  She kept saying she wasn?t able to see or feel her extremities.  Her lack of vision resolved within 10-15 seconds. She had weakness in her arms and legs but was able to squeeze her hands on command.  She was alert and oriented X3.  BP was 130/90.  The patient was stable when the ambulance arrived to transport her to Hospital.

                                                After the 2nd dose on Day 2 I had a fever for about 3 hours before I took more medication. I took acetaminophen round the clock but still felt uncomfortably hot all day.  I had severe fatigue most of the day and slept or laid in bed. My body ached especially at the injection site and at times it felt like my hand was in pain on that arm. I had brain fog as well.   Today is Day 3 and I have so much pain at injection site it was sometimes hard to sleep. It feels almost intramuscular and my pain from the first dose went away after Day 2 and the site mostly just felt sore.  I have also experience nausea and drainage in my nose. I?m tired today but less so than Day 2. I am still a little foggy in my brain and my neck hurts quite a bit.

                                                I had the Moderna vaccine at 6:35 PM on June 21st, 2021. Pins and needles/tingling on the left side of my face began the following morning at 10 AM on June 22nd, 2021. The tingling goes from in front of my left ear, along my cheek and jaw into my bottom lip. The pins and needles on the left side of my face has been constant since it began, and has NOT resolved as of 06/25/21.  Occasionally tingling is felt on right side of face and down into both of my arms/hands. I had aching/tenderness down the left side of my neck/throat, down into my left shoulder blade on 06/24/21, but no injection site pain.  I had a doctors appointment on 06/23/21 and they were unable to diagnose me, but told me to follow up if the problem persists which it has. I had no pre-existing health conditions and am an active healthy woman.

I then went to the hospital to see what was going on.

                                                Roughly an hour after my first vaccine, I nearly passed out and felt incredibly weak. I could not walk or speak, I could only moan and I ran a fever of around 100 for about twelve hours. A few days later, I started my period a couple weeks earlier than usual but it was incredibly light and was only for two days. Then when I was supposed to get my period I never did, then I never got my next period that following month. I have had my period consistently since I was eleven years old. This is the first time I?ve skipped and nothing has changed, I am not sexually active or on any contraception and never have been.  After my second dose of the vaccine, about an hour after I received the last shot, I began to get a headache and layer down. I woke up in the morning and was shaking, sweating, I could not move due to a burning and tingling pain throughout my body, and I had a terrible headache. I could not take a deep breath without feeling tight in my chest and a sharp pain shooting from chest around to my back and up my neck. My heart has been feeling like it is bubbling and racing. The slightest raising of my voice or active movement causes me to lose my breath and the pain gets worse. This has been going on since receiving my last does and it is currently about three days later.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event.    On 25-Jun-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 25-Jun-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (Convulsions) (seriousness criterion medically significant). 25-Jun-2021, the patient experienced VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Patient is experiencing a possible vaccine reaction). The patient was treated with LORAZEPAM (ATIVAN) 25-Jun-2021 for Convulsion, at a dose of 2 mg. At the time of the report, SEIZURE (Convulsions) was resolving and VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Patient is experiencing a possible vaccine reaction) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant product use was not provided. Lab Data: results pending. It was reported that in the emergency room they have treated the patient with 2mg of Ativan, with improving results, from convulsing to subtle shakes.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

After both my first and second dose, I started my period on the same day that I received the vaccine. My period was on time but, different. The colour of blood seemed off, looked diluted in a way, and I had EXTREME cramping which is abnormal for me. At one point I felt as if I was having contractions. The extreme cramping occured the following day after receiving my vaccines. It has been 36 hours since my second dose and the symptoms are subsiding.

                                                Two minutes after the participant got the vaccine, she began coughing and complaining of tightness of the throat and numbness and tingling on the face. She was then given 15mg of Benadryl intramuscular injection. She was monitored, but her symptoms didn&#39;t improve; even after 10 minutes, she still had tightness of the throat and numbness and tingling on the face. She then began having chills, shivering, nausea, vomiting, and overall weakness. 911 was called, and the paramedics came and transferred the participant to the ER. The staff were told that she was being sent to the Medical Center, but they aren&#39;t sure if that&#39;s the case.

The brain fog also started the next morning after the vaccine again. It hasn&#39;t resolved yet. I have been out of work since May 10th. That is when I started with it being a significant problem. I lost my job due to it sort of.  I started going to Psychiatrist - and have had lab work - my primary care - Anxiety. My Psychiatrist - COVID vaccine and some of my anxiety as well. I started anew job now but it&#39;s been hard. I&#39;m pushing through . We have done around 11 medication changes with my psychiatrist to see if anything will help and nothing has helped the brain fog symptoms to improve. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve had any cognitive side affects. It is almost a disassociation that my mind and body isn&#39;t working together. It&#39;s almost like I have put on the wrong prescription glasses on. I can function. But I still feel impairment from it and it invokes a lot of anxiety because it&#39;s not a normal feeling. I am currently on treatment and  have changed all the meds. 75 mg of Wellbutrin ER. in the AM and I&#39;m doing 0.25 of Xanax ER in the morning. My vitamins are the same. Before bed 0.5 mg of Xanax extended release. As needed 0.5 immediate release of Xanax during the day. Have been seeing a chiropractor as well for treatment.
