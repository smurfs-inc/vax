Patient is 16 and received Moderna vaccine. Both state&#39;s current guidance and my correspondence with CDC indicate that she should receive 2nd dose of Moderna and not change to Pfizer. Patient does have a history of Rett Syndrome (rare neurologic genetic defect). Parents report 1 week after receiving Moderna vaccination, she experience her first seizure and was transported and treated at Hospital. Seizures can be a feature of this disorder but the patient had not experienced one in the past. Her parents report that her Neurologist does not believe the seizure to be related to vaccination. I informed parents I would search the VAERS system for similar reports. They were not enrolled in V-Safe, but I encouraged them to do so and gave them a link to the CDC site for registration. Correspondence with CDC (via email): &#34;If the Moderna vaccine is inadvertently administered to patients 16 or 17 years old instead of Pfizer-BioNTech as the first dose, CDC currently recommends that the Moderna vaccine may be administered as the second dose (as off-label use). The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible, 28 days for the Moderna vaccine. Additional information regarding administration errors and deviations can be found in CDC?s current interim clinical considerations regarding mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

                                                This event was not an adverse event, however, it was an invalid dose because the patient was less than 18 years of age when she received her first dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine. Patient did state she experienced some light dizziness about 5 minutes after she was given the vaccine and that this has happened before with the influenza vaccine. She also stated that she did not have anything to eat or drink at all that morning so she may have been experiencing weakness from that as well.  It resolved within 10-15 minutes and patient was fine to go home per other healthcare providers.

                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                I got the vaccine sometime in the afternoon and felt fine for the 15 minutes after the time of injection. I returned to work afterwards, and later that evening I started to feel chills, but it wasn&#39;t severe to the point where I went home. When I returned home from work, the chills remained but I also felt extremely exhausted which was unusual for me. I also had a bit of a headache/felt lightheaded. I took Tylenol which somewhat helped the symptoms. I felt fine after going to bed.

When RN and I reached patient she was very weak, she was sitting in a chair. I instructed her colleauges to call 911 immediately. Patient was having a little trouble breathing. I think she was scared. I gave her 10 mlL of benedryl and RN administered a 0.5 mL dose of epinephine in her left arm. Patient was helped to the  floor and her feet were elevated.  RN put on a blood pressure cuff. Before she could get a reading, the paramedics were there and took over. Patient was transported to Hospital.

                                                My arm became incredibly sore within an hour. I woke up in the middle of the night aching like I had the flu. The body aches were so intense I couldn?t dress myself in the morning. All of my lymph nodes in my neck, ribs, and collar bones were incredibly swollen and hurt when touched. I rotated Tylenol and Advil with no relief. My fatigue was like no other. My headache wouldn?t go away either. 48 hours after the vaccine, I still had body aches and swollen lymph nodes in my neck to the point of pain when turning my neck.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

Patient presents on 1/27/2021 after onset of pain, decreased ROM ongoing since administration.  I was able to visualize ecchymotic area where vaccine was administered and patient has photo evidence.  The physician responsible for the vaccine administration needs to be retrained on where to give deltoid muscle IM injections and to avoid the extremities where recent surgeries occurred (patient had right shoulder labrum repair in October 2020)

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

                                                On 12/31/2020 I had a headache and I was tired.  Over then next two days my arm was very sore.  That subsided by 1/02/21.  On 1/07/21 I woke up around 8 AM with my arm being sore again and at ejection site I had a red circle. The ejection site was also swollen. I took a benedryl and the pain subsided but the red circle continued to grow.  On 1/08/21 the circle got even bigger (even with taking two 25 mg tablets of benedryl before bed) and it?s warm to the touch.    Also on 1/07/2021 at around 6 pm I began menstrual spotting (this would be in the dead middle of my usual cycle). It continued into today ,1/08/2021. This is unusual for me as I have never experienced spotting in the middle of my cycle.   Also on today 1/08/2021 my arm soreness has returned as the red circle is  growing bigger around the ejection site (approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 inches). I?m also experiencing extra tiredness and a headache.

I could not life my arm past my chest because it was so swollen and sore. I stayed at home and skipped new year&#39;s, going back to sleep around 1030pm. It was not fun

I had had a sore arm all day which I expected, but after trying to sleep it off I woke up around 2am shivering and sweating through my shirt at the same time, and had a 98.7 temperature (normally I am 97.2 so that&#39;s high for me). My arm started to have some swelling at the site, but I woke up this morning and the fever, chills, and nausea are still very much present about 24 hours after receiving the first dose.

The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

                                                I got up to use the bathroom at 4:30 this morning. I was extremely shaky but made it. I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

                                                The first two days after injection it was painful to lift arm above 30 degrees and hurt upon palpation and I had an overall tiredness. A week after the injection on 1/13/2021 I developed a raised, red rash surrounding the injection site (2in x 4 in). The skin that was inflamed was 101.2 degrees fahrenheit.  The intense rash lasted around 24 hours and subsided after 3 treatments of Benadryl cream and one dose of oral Benadryl. The skin is still slightly raised and has a slight redness to it today (1/15/2021) but is much better than before.

Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 2/10/21 and had a large, red, inflamed area on her arm at the injection site for a few days, but otherwise tolerated vaccine well. She received the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/10/21 and the next day (3/11/21) developed fatigue and lightheadedness while exercising, which continued for the next few days. She developed acute onset, sharp chest pain on 3/13/21 AM which did not resolve so she presented to an ED. Vitals were normal but labs notable for troponin I which peaked at 4.36, CK 758, d-dimer 640. CBC/CMP and EKG were unremarkable and initial TTE with EF ~45%. Repeat TTE obtained a few days later with normal LV and RV size/function without any wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac MRI obtained with normal LV function (EF 64%) but late gadolinium enhancement in a subepicardial distribution within the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle at the base most compatible with myocarditis. ESR and CRP were normal. Further workup to determine etiology of myocarditis was negative (ANA, ANCA, RF, hepatitis panel, HIV, full respiratory viral panel, COVID-19 PCR). She was placed on metoprolol succinate 12.5mg XL daily and will follow up with a cardiologist as an outpatient. Family concerned that COVID-19 vaccine was the trigger/underlying etiology of her myocarditis.

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

The next morning 12/29/2020 I woke up with a migraine and still had severe pain in my arm. That night (12/29/2020) I began feeling aches and pains throughout my body and felt that into the next morning (12/30/2020). The evening of 12/30/2020 I noticed a dollar coin sized red spot on my arm that was warm to the touch and was slightly raised. (By this time my arm pain had decreased but was still present.) The red spot had grown slightly by 12/31/2020 but not much. Friday 01/01/2021 I hadn&#39;t payed much attention to the spot but it looked the same. The morning of 01/02/2021 I woke up and had noticed that the spot had taken over a large portion of the outer bicep on my right arm.

At 10:28PM my temperature went up to 101.5. Took Tylenol and fell asleep woke up at 3AM fever of 102.3 . Fell asleep and woke up again with a fever of 102.6. I had chills nausea weakness body aches headache. Took Tylenol again and fell asleep only to wake up again at 6:30Am  still with a fever of 102. Nothing was making it go away I had no appetite extremely fatigued and nauseous it felt like I had covid again. I also felt swollen lymph nodes under my arm. By Sunday I was feeling way better and my fever was gone. Monday my ear popped again lasting a minute that?s never happened before. Monday today 01-05 still having headaches and now chest pain. I felt so bad I wanted to go to the hospital but did not it really did feel like I had covid all over again I would not want to put my self through that again.  Also I did have covid back in October I believe just wanted to put that out there.

It&#39;s been two days already, and I&#39;m still down with a fever, bad headaches, dizziness, and a sore shoulder - I put ice pack, which didn&#39;t really work. Whenever I stand, I feel like I&#39;m gonna pass out. I&#39;ve been in bed for the past two days, and I can&#39;t work.

On 12/28/2020 noticed the pain was back and I now have a medium sized lump in my armpit that was causing pain. On 12/31/2020 began to have a rash around the injection site that was increasing in size and limiting arm mobility. PCH EH sent CG to WorkMed and CG was given Rx for Keflex which was completed on 01/07/2021--CG stated symptoms are greatly improve.

I had some minor swelling and soreness the first couple days after receiving the vaccine, but these symptoms both went away after a couple of days. A week later on 1/5, I noticed that the area where I had been injected was very swollen, red and itchy. It was localized to this year. There was some slight bruising around the top of where the swelling started. The area was not sore. There is still some redness and itching on 1/7 but the swelling has mostly gone down. I work in a community health center and had a PA I work with look at the reaction. I took some Benadryl as directed on 1/5 but have not treated the symptoms further.

                                                Less than 24 hours after receiving the vaccine (Jan 7), I started experiencing bad stomach pain, which a family friend had also experienced after she received the vaccine (also ~24 hours later). It did not subside with time, and became feeling like a shooting pain that was coming and going in waves, and I could not sleep that night. I was nauseous at one point, and threw up. I drank water throughout the night, which seemed to help a little bit and was taking an NSAID. The following day (Jan 8), the shooting pain continued, and I was in bed all day. I became nauseous at one point during the day, when attempting to move a piece of furniture, but did not throw up. I continued taking NSAIDs, which did not help. I was able to sleep through the night after taking melatonin, but was in discomfort. The following day (Jan 9), I woke up, and the shooting stomach pain had radiated to my chest, and had not subsided. I called my PCP, who I was unable to see due to timing/distance from the office, and she recommended I go to an ED if I did not feel better. As the pain was in my chest, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it had radiated there or was cardiac related, I had a friend drive me to the ED. My results came back normal at the ED, and the PA was only able to tell me that it was GI related, due to the pain in my stomach/esophagus. She was unsure if it&#39;s GERD, gas trapped, or some other GI issue. I am still experiencing this pain (Jan 11), but have somewhat managed it by taking Tums and eating alkaline foods.

My chest felt heavy and I was having labored breathing, My heart was racing at 160bpm and my blood pressure was 180/90, both of which are very high and abnormal for me.  I had severe joint and muscle pain. I had the chills and could not stop shaking.  I was very weak and could not even move out of bed, Leading to me calling 911 for an ambulance at 10:21pm. They kept me in the Emergency department until 5:30am because they could not get my heart rate to stay down. Stony Brook nurse told me it was okay to get vaccine even though I was infected with COVID-19 ON 12/15/2020.

On the way, the patient began to black out to the point where she had to lay down on the floor and could not regain strength for a few minutes and would have fallen over if sitting down and then laying down did not occur. A few minutes were spent laying down and then the episode went away and she was able to get up. She then walked back to her bed and did began to feel light headed, dizzy, and began blacking out again. The patient layed down in bed and waited for the episode to pass again.

                                                I recieved the first dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/5/21 and did not experience any adverse reactions in the days following. Then, on 1/13/21 (8 days post vaccine) I noticed hives covering most of my body. My face was tingling and my lips were swollen. I took an antihistamine that evening hoping it would go away. The day after 1/14/21 I woke up with the hives all over my body, especially on my face. They were very severe and itchy. I went to my dermatologist and they recommended a steroid cream and oral antihistamine to help reduce the itching. It is now 1/15/20, and the hives are still covering most of my body with severe hives on my face.

Left after sitting for 20 minutes because I thought the &#34;anxiety&#34; would resolve best at home. Arrived home at 10:25 AM. My lips started itching, and then swelled along with my tongue. My throat felt tight and I tried to take an oral Benadryl. It got stuck in my throat and I was unable to swallow the pill. It was also difficult to swallow water. I arrived at the ED by 10:40 AM, where I was treated with IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol. I remained swollen all over, especially in my fingers, for the next 4 days. I gained 12 pounds, either from the reaction or the steroids. My airway did not fully close.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

Body hurt a lot, fever of 100.7, arm is hard, hot, and red. Spot around injection site is growing. Took too Tylenol around 10am to make it possible for me to work. Chills became mild and temp dropped to 99.6 for most of the time I was taking Tylenol. 24 hours after the symptoms started they went from severe to moderate (without the use of Tylenol).

The patient also noted &#34;tingling&#34; in her right arm where she received the vaccine.  In addition, there was localized erythema at the injection site with about 5 cm in diameter.  I gave the patient 37 mg of Benadryl and the edema immediately was reduced in addition to the erythema resolved.  She had no more tingling.  I observed her for 30 minutes and all was fine with the patient.  I then checked on her 1 hour later and all was good.

I took benadryl, and was relieved of these symptoms. Then, around 9pm that night, I developed a fever. The highest temperature I recorded was 101.9. I took Ibuprofen around 11pm, and was afebrile by 3am. I have not had any fevers since, and I did have to call off work New Year&#39;s day. I have had an intermittent, mild headache since receiving the vaccine as well,  but overall I feel fine.

                                                I had awful migraines that did NOT improve with Tylenol or Ibprophen.  My migraines had an aura to them on the 1/1/2021.  I was also nauseous and had a difficult time keeping food down.  I was also very tired and slept longer than I normally do.  I had my vaccine done on 12/30/2020 and the symptoms did not occur until 1/01/2021. An hour or so after the injection, my arm started to become sore. It was very sore until 1/3/2021. They lasted until 1/3/2021. Now I feel fine.

                                                Fast Heart rate after an hour and half of injection and shortness of breath . Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

I woke up a little before 1030PM shaking with chills and nauseated. I couldn&#39;t sleep the whole night, going between sweating and shaking. The next day 1/6/21 I was still unwell, didn&#39;t go into work, felt weak and sore the whole day and noticed my underarm of the arm I received the shot was swollen and painful,. Today 1/7/21, my underarm is still painful and swollen, but the nausea has subsided. Still slightly going between sweating and being chilled.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

                                                I had head pressure that felt like a headache In my temples and the back of my skull around 9-10 hours after the vaccine. Left arm pain starting about 11 hours after shot. Difficult to move arm without intense pain and intense pain at the slightest touch of the arm on or around the vaccination spot. Starting the morning after the vaccination, my glands in my neck were tender and aching like they do when I?m fighting off a cold, I had body aches that you would get if you had a fever for the entire day all over my body. I took ibuprofen that night and they started to go away and I felt hot like I was breaking a fever. I woke up the next morning which is 2 days after the vaccination and felt completely back to normal besides residual arm pain. This pain is bearable and I can move my arm with only a dull pain and I can touch the spot without intense pain however it is still painful.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, January 5th at 9:00 AM. I felt fine immediately following the vaccine but quickly felt worse throughout the day. I developed a fever of 101.4F with medicine, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and general malaise. I know these are all common symptoms, so I didn&#39;t worry too much. However, my fever has persisted. I stayed home from work Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday due to not feeling well and still having a fever. Thursday, I also developed pain in my armpit with movement and palpation. I am guessing that pain in related to swollen lymph nodes. Friday, the pain in my armpit seemed to spread into my arm. Most of my armpit and the upper inside of my bicep is extremely tender to movement and touch. Today, I still have some tenderness in my arm and my fever is still present. Throughout this week, my fever has remained around 100F, even with Tylenol and ibuprofen.   I contacted my PCP yesterday about my concern for my persistent fever and arm pain. They believe that because I tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020, that I am reacting to the first dose of the vaccine as if I am receiving the second dose of the vaccine. They advised me to continue taking ibuprofen and Tylenol. I am worried that if I receive the second dose of the vaccine, I will be sick for longer.

                                                On 1/4/2020 at roughly 07:00 PM, a dull ache started in my right arm where the vaccine was injected, it radiated from my right shoulder, to my right shoulder blade. My arm felt very heavy. There was also a small hard lump beginning to form with a little heat at the injection site. I had difficulty sleeping due to the aching pain. On 1/5/2020, I woke up at 06:30 AM, the lump had grown in size, and was much more red and hot to the touch, in an oval shape. By roughly 11:30 AM same day, it began to itch, I had checked it and the lump had raised significantly. Hot to the touch. The dull ache had begun radiating into my right armpit as well as down to my right elbow. By 06:00 PM, same day, the aching had continued,  the lump was still very raised, itchy, red, and hot. It looked like a large hive. By 06:30 AM on 1/6/2020, the dull ache had mostly subsided, my shoulder blade still felt uncomfortable. The itching continued. The redness spread in size, however the swelling of the lump had gone down slightly. By 06:30 AM on 1/7/2020, the lump had mostly gone down in size significantly, the dull ache had subsided completely, the redness had gone away. By 1/8/2020, 10:00 PM, the lump and swelling are gone, no ache, no itch, still a slight discoloration where lump was.

                                                Patient reported feeling like her tongue was tingling and felt larger than normal. She did not report having any difficulty breathing.  25mg of Benadryl was given orally.  After 10 minutes she thought she was feeling a bit better, but then continued to say that she was having tingling and not &#34;feeling normal&#34;.  We decided to administer epinephrine instead of waiting for her to continue to get worse.  I administered an epi-pen (0.3mg) about 30 minutes after she took the Benadryl and a nurse from the SNF called 911.  Paramedics arrived and evaluated her.  Her breathing sounded okay via the paramedic&#39;s stethoscope.  Because she was still not reporting feeling &#34;back to normal&#34; and because she had epinephrine administered, she was transported via ambulance to the ER for continued monitoring.

                                                Starting around 8 pm on 1/6 I developed a headache and body aches. I took Tylenol which seemed to help my symptoms. At 2:30 AM (1/7) I was awoken with shivering chills, likely a fever. Fever was not confirmed until 8 AM (1/7) when my temperature was taken - 101.3F. I alternated Advil and Tylenol with minimal improvement. At 2 PM (1/7)  my temperature was still elevated at 100.8 F. Overall I was very fatigued and had a pounding headache in addition to chills. My fever broke around 7 PM (1/7), at which point my headache and chills were improving. By the next morning, my symptoms were mostly resolved, except for a mild headache which persisted throughout the day (1/8) but resolved by evening time.

                                                Gradual onset of soreness beginning about an hour post-vaccine and worsening throughout day. By the evening, left arm pain was too uncomfortable to wash dishes and lift household objects. Pain woke me up at 3am that night and I could not push the covers off of me, dress or undress, and I experienced severe pain with slight movement (7/10). Nausea and cold sweats began around 5am and lasted for 45min. I contacted the nurse via messaging system and was told to take OTC nausea medicine and Tylenol. I took the maximum dosage for Tylenol that day but could not do my normal school functions. The next day I was still limited by pain but did not require medication to cope. By day three, I had full range of motion back and minimal pain. Day four I am back to exercising normally.

I went to the Emergency Department and got Prednisone, Pepcid, and Benadryl.  The next day, I started to experience tremors, mostly in my right hand.   Two days later, I was so dizzy that the room was spinning and I could hardly stand up. Did not receive treatment for it.

Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

The welt is very firm and slightly tender to the touch, blanches when pressure is applied, and occasionally itchy. My arm is also sore I am still experience extreme fatigue. No treatment or medications have been taken to alleviate these symptoms at the time of this report submission.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, I had redness around the injection site and a sore arm for about 2-3 days. I received the shot on a Tuesday, and by the weekend my arm felt fine. One week later (Monday 25th), I felt like I had a light fever. My temperature was 99.1F. Tuesday, my left arm where I received the injection was SO SUPER itchy. When I looked at it, there was a huge, red, swollen, bump. The area was about the size of a credit card. The area was also HOT to the touch even though the rest of my arm felt like a normal temperature. From Tuesday 26th through Wednesday 27th (time of reporting), I still have the big, red, hot bump at the injection site, and my fever fluctuates in between 99.1-100.4F. I contacted my doctor who believes it is most likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He has advised me to take benadryl and tylenol, and if I still have the fever tomorrow, he will test me for strep, flu, and COVID. I have not taken the benadryl and tylenol long enough to see if there is any sort of impact. I should also mention that I get tested weekly for COVID at work, and my test from Monday January 25 has come back as negative.

Severe headache, throat sore with swollen glands, could barely walk/move or get out of bed. Also experienced nausea. Took tylenol around 1:00am and again at 5:00am.  Could not move from bed on Wednesday and had to call out of work Thursday with a bad headache, weakness, and overall body pain/discomfort. It is now Friday and I am still having very bad joint and muscle pain when I walk and move and still have a headache and fatigue/weakness.

At about 30 minutes post injection, she stated she had small bumps on her bilateral arms. They were hard for me to discern but she also claimed the bumps were painful.  I asked about any labored breathing or chest tightening and she denied both. After about ~45-50, she still stated the same itchiness and pain. Visually there was no change in my opinion. Patient then conferred with  supervisors at her employment about her next steps. Her PCP was closed and she was deciding if she wanted to go to urgent care. That&#39;s the last interaction I had.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

Around lunch today (01/04/21) I was moving my neck around and when I move it to the left it rolls over something. I began to feel around the area and noticed that where the sore area is I have a rather large knot. It is a hard knot that is very tender and sore. No other signs and symptoms present. I have not been to a doctor or clinic regarding the issue. I was unsure if this issue was directly related with the vaccine or not.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  Approximately 24 hours following the vaccination I began to feel light headed and extremely fatigued. I began to have a small rash around my hair-line that spread to my chest and arms. I self-medicated with diphenhydramine and recovered by the end of the day.

The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

                                                awoke at 2 am  with nausea, chills, generalized pain. Immediately felt myself start to pass out or have a seizure- I am not sure which. Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

                                                Almost 48 hours after the vaccine I woke up with hives flush to my skin along my R&amp;L arms, under my arms, on my left hand, insides of both thighs, and around my ankles. My skin felt hot but minimally itchy. The insides of my hands and burn when I wash them and they feel really sore. The bottoms of my feet also felt like they were burning when I took a shower. Nothing in my diet or hygiene products have changes. I took a half dose of Benadryl at 11am today and the hives are still there along with the pain in my hands when washing them. I coordinated with my PCP and they recommended self monitoring and Benadryl.

We transported her via gurney to our observation area. She looked sleepy and had trouble arousing her. Blood pressure is 140/80, heart rate was in the 90s to 100s. Breath sound decreased bilaterally. No lip swelling. No rash. She noted throat felt uncomfortable.

Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

Hurt to raise above my shoulder. This went on till about 1/9/21. Then it went away nothing at my infection site then it came back which is what my concern is same as 1/7/21 itchy, swollen, red and bruised. Why I?m reporting is I?m wondering if I should take my 2nd dose or not from these reactions just at the injection site and only fatigue. This is Day 10. I also took pictures 1/8/21 and 1/15/21

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

The following day I noticed half of my face was paralyzed and I went to urgent care. The Dr. diagnosed me with Bells Palsy and put me on antibiotics for 10days. I asked for more because it wasn&#39;t healing, but hey didn&#39;t me anymore. Maybe a week after I did a phone visit and asked If I should get more medicine and they said no. Maybe a week ago from today 1/27/21 I seen my PCP and she contacted the Neurology department at medical center regarding  my situation. After about 3 weeks of having this im about 90% better.

Flu like symptoms starting that evening (unsure what time, as I was trying to sleep). Arm soreness where I received the vaccine, muscle aches that kept waking me up throughout the night, headache, fever, slight congestion, chills and sweating, nausea, dizziness when I stand up, fatigue. As of 4:00 PM on 1/29 (the day after the vaccine) I am still experiencing this list of flu-like symptoms.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? The day I got the vaccine all that happened was a dead arm and then when I was driving home after the 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The next day my arm was sore to move, but not at the injection spot, if looking at my arm (someone else) it was down 3 inches and to the left about 1 inch. The next day that same spot was still sore but to the touch, then it went away.    What is more interesting and concerning is that on 1/6/2021 (a week after I got the shot), I noticed 3 little bumps on my arm (9:45pm), in that same location that was sore to move and touch on day 2 and 3 but they also were itchy. When I woke up the next morning (6:15 am) the area had spread to the size of my palm (3 inch by 3 inch roughly)  it was all red, hard to the touch,  stilly itchy and I had the feeling of a dead arm again. One of the nurses at my work drew a circle around the red spot so we could watch to see if it was still growing , by roughly 11:45 am it had grown an additional 2 inches.

I also have moderate left arm pain where I received the vaccine. It is now 3:00pm 1/7/20 and the fever, chills, nausea, and body aches have subsided, however the fatigue and left arm pain still persists.

I started to feel chills and back pain around 7 pm.  Throughout the night my arm was throbbing and I had a hard time sleeping. I woke up around 12 am to use the restroom. My body felt VERY heavy and weak. I woke up today (1 day after the shot) and felt better.  However, my arm still has severe pain and I experiencing fatigue. I also feel like the back pain goes in and out.

However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

                                                Starting at 9pm, I experienced chills, shaking, headache, wide spread muscle soreness, fast heart rate, and nausea. My temperature was 99.5 consistently throughout the night but did not exceed this number. I took Advil twice throughout the night which relieved some of the headache. My symptoms stopped about 12/13 hours later.  Symptoms felt very similar to the flu.

They do improve greatly with ibuprofen at home.

I then began feeling lightheaded and dizzy about 2 hours after vaccination. Shortly after I became feverish with chills. I then took 2 Ibuprofen and fever/chills subsided, however lightheadedness continued but improved slightly.

Post vaccination she was seated in the passenger seat in vaccine pod observation lot and felt like she &#34;was going to pass out&#34;. Her husband got the attention of the paramedic overseeing the area. She did not become unresponsive at any time but became very pale. Her BP was 80/40 when initially checked. EMS was call and she was shortly thereafter taken to a local ED via non emergent transport. Her husband had driven her to the pod site and did not receive a vaccination.  She was discharged home yesterday.

                                                I received my vaccine around 12:45pm. They had me go to waiting room and wait for 10 mins. I sat down and was waiting for a few minutes when I started to get dizzy. I looked up and told the lady checking people in ?hey I?m getting really dizzy can I lay down? she said yes come in the room. When I stood up my heart started beating really fast. I sat on the table and my chest started feeling tight and heavy. There were 2 ladies in the room at this point so I asked one of them if they had an epipen on hand just in case. My throat wasn?t swelling but it was getting harder to breath from the tightness in my chest. She said they didn?t have an epipen and would have to call emergency services if I needed one. I told her I didn?t know what was going on, that I didn?t need one yet but she should probably call emergency services if they can?t do anything to help me. (ER is right across the street) my symptoms went away shortly after they called. But came on a couple more times but much milder over the next 30 minutes or so. The EMT gave me Benadryl and the ER ran some tests.

The vaccine was administered to my left arm without complication at approximately 1:00pm (my scheduled appointment). I proceeded to the area designated for patients to be observed after receiving the vaccine and was asked to wait 15 minutes. I recall getting to the observation area then telling my spouse I felt unwell - after the event he notified me that I told him I was about to pass out and asked him to get medical help. I lost consciousness approximately 5-10 minutes following the vaccine. My husband reported that after losing consciousness I seemed to have a minor seizure, as evidenced by my head jerking and my arms and fingers &#34;tensing and curling up&#34;.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of my car at this time, so I suffered no fall or fall related injury. Public health officials and EMT responded. They indicated to my spouse that I had experienced a vasovagal syncope episode and that I had &#34;gone tonic&#34;/ had a &#34;tonic seizure&#34;.  They took my blood pressure, which was very low (I don&#39;t recall exactly but it was 80 over something). They also took my blood sugar among other things that I do not recall.  I was given oxygen and put into an ambulance. I was shaking, so they wrapped me in blankets. I believe they may have done an EKG and placed a blood pressure cuff while I was in the ambulance, but I do not recall any specifics about this. The EMT also drew my blood, placed an IV, and administered IV fluids while I was in the ambulance. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency department

                                                Arm became incredibly sore about 4 hours after injection.  The soreness was so intense that I felt nauseous when I moved my arm or bumped the injection site. About 11 hours after the injection a severe headache began. Roughly 19 hours after the injection muscle fatigue and overall tiredness began, headache remained as well as arm soreness. About 30 hours after the injection all the symptoms above were present in addition to a fever. Currently it is about 54 hours after the injection and only a slight headache and slight arm soreness remain.

                                                Several minutes after the vaccine she became light headed, EMT evaluated her and stated she was tachycardic (did not give a pulse) and was initially unable to find a BP.  She appeared pale and was crying and hyperventilating.  She stated she had a funny feeling in her throat and numbness in her fingers.  We prepared to administer an epi-pen but she was increasingly anxious so we had to place her in a supine position first.  Immediately she started to feel better, her color was normal and her blood pressure was 110/70 with a pulse of 67.  Her throat no longer felt ?funny.?  We continued to monitor her and did NOT administer epinephrine.  An ambulance arrived and she was ambulatory and feeling normal so declined transport. Follow-up with patient 1/18/21, she states she is feeling good. She said she and her mother both have a history of passing out with any procedure involving needles and she does not feel her symptoms were caused by the vaccine itself. She plans to receive her scheduled 2nd dose from us.

Vitals signs, breathing and circulation monitored closely until EMS arrival. Pt was transported by ambulance to the hospital emergency department for evaluation.

                                                Starting 01/16/2021, there was itchiness and a cluster of red papules/wheals that showed up on my right back. The rash continued to spread the next few days with increasing papules and itchiness. The rash is localized to my torso. Most are on my right abdomen and right back but is now spreading to my left side and upper back. There are also a few under and on my right breast and below both my armpit areas. The rash is still erythematous, with some that are papular and some appearing like vesicles. There is still itchiness and some stinging sensation. I am currently on Hydroxyzine 25MG at night and Zyrtec OTC during day but it has only been 2 days since I started the meds. The itch does wake me up at night time. So far the antihistamines have helped a bit with the itch. At the same time, I appear to have a sore throat though it feels more like a mild swelling of my throat as whenever I swallow it feels sore.

                                                The staff from another of our own company facility had come for getting vaccinated at this Clinic. After around 15 minutes or so after vaccination, she was feeling little light headed, and nauseating and tried throwing up during the observation period as per protocol after vaccination. We advised her to stay longer and  as precaution, we reached out to our facility, who advised to observe her for some more time and if she does not feel better, she can go to Urgent care accompanied by someone. We gave her Gatorade and after around 40-45 minutes she was feeling better and someone from her family came to pick her up. She did not wanted to go to Urgent Care at that time but we advised her if she does not feel good, she should go to Urgent Care.

                                                I got the vaccination 1/23/21 and after 15 minutes I left. Later that night I was feeling a little off and thought it wasn&#39;t a big deal. Went to sleep woke up with 101 fever, body ached pain, and chills. Took ibuprofen and felt a little better. Then noticed the spot on arm got bigger and mother drew border, then this morning no fever but feeling uncomfortable joint pain and now the spot is bigger than the border. I went to the urgent care today 1/25/2021 after reading CDC recommendation and was diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed penicillin.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

                                                Woke up around 5AM with a severe headache and tenderness at injection site. Throat was also very dry. Was not able to go back to sleep due to pain. Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

I had severe chills, severe body aches, a mild fever, and extreme redness and swelling at the injection site. The side effects kept me out of work for one shift. The chills, body aches, and fever subsided within 36 hours, the severe redness and swelling at the injection site has continued to persist. I took Tylenol 1g q8hr for the side effects.

Patient expressed no adverse effects when contacted two days post injection other than soreness of arms.

                                                The day after the vaccine I started spotting  and my back started getting numbness down my legs. I kept moving my legs because I was afraid I was going to lose feeling in them. I got an X-ray and it showed there is nothing wrong with my back and I concluded it has to be from the vaccine because it has resolved for the most part after 3 weeks. I was extremely fatigued for 3 days and my left cervical and right axillary lymph  nodes were swollen. I had a huge welt at the injection site for 2 weeks and now there?s still a bruise there. I am afraid to get my second vaccine because I don?t want to lose feeling in my legs. I need guidance from someone who knows a lot about this vaccine because no one is able to give me guidance.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I noticed extreme tiredness and light headedness. I got up to notify staff and my vision went and I began to feel nauseated. They helped me to a seat and I began sweating profusely and the nausea intensified. After several minutes the nausea and vision changes subsided and I continued to feel extremely tired and light headed.  The staff put a heart rate monitor on me and I saw that my heart rate was sitting around 38-42. I felt like I just wanted to close my eyes but the staff kept asking me questions. After several more minutes a cop arrived. Later on an ambulance arrived and when they put the blood pressure cuff on I noticed tingling in my hand from it. I continued to feel light headed and extremely tired through arriving at the hospital via ambulance around 10:30am. These symptoms gradually subsided throughout the afternoon leaving me with light headedness  only when walking or moving around. While at the hospital they did an EKG which showed inverted T waves (from what I remember of the PA&#39;s description) and so admitted me for observation and performed an echo which came back normal. I was discharged around 10pm on the same night.
