Another staff member had checked the online appointments the day before and did not see any discrepancies in the ages of our appointments.This client was 16. Client had made the appointment after her checking this. Client was shown to the registration desk where they are told it is Moderna  vaccine. It is advertised we have Moderna. Father was present the whole time and did not get vaccinated. Client had no adverse effects after getting vaccine, nor in the observation area. We caught the error when it could not be entered into the system. I called the client on MondayJanuary 25. Client said she only had a sore arm. I explained what happened and that her second dose would not be Moderna. Client called me later in the day and was asking more questions about what will happen when her second dose comes up. Then she said she has a lawyer and to whom should see address it to.

Patient is 16 and received Moderna vaccine. Both state&#39;s current guidance and my correspondence with CDC indicate that she should receive 2nd dose of Moderna and not change to Pfizer. Patient does have a history of Rett Syndrome (rare neurologic genetic defect). Parents report 1 week after receiving Moderna vaccination, she experience her first seizure and was transported and treated at Hospital. Seizures can be a feature of this disorder but the patient had not experienced one in the past. Her parents report that her Neurologist does not believe the seizure to be related to vaccination. I informed parents I would search the VAERS system for similar reports. They were not enrolled in V-Safe, but I encouraged them to do so and gave them a link to the CDC site for registration. Correspondence with CDC (via email): &#34;If the Moderna vaccine is inadvertently administered to patients 16 or 17 years old instead of Pfizer-BioNTech as the first dose, CDC currently recommends that the Moderna vaccine may be administered as the second dose (as off-label use). The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible, 28 days for the Moderna vaccine. Additional information regarding administration errors and deviations can be found in CDC?s current interim clinical considerations regarding mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                For my first dose, I had quite mild symptoms. I woke up with a migraine the next morning and some soreness at the injection site. Both of these lasted a couple of days and were able to be treated with over-the-counter pain medicine. My second dose, however, provided much worse flu-like symptoms. About 12 hours after I received the injection, I was woken with a migraine much worse than the first, nausea, chills, joint pain, sore throat, and fatigue. While the chills and nausea subsided, the other symptoms persisted until the next day. As of today (2/4/21), all symptoms are gone except for soreness at the injection site.

When RN and I reached patient she was very weak, she was sitting in a chair. I instructed her colleauges to call 911 immediately. Patient was having a little trouble breathing. I think she was scared. I gave her 10 mlL of benedryl and RN administered a 0.5 mL dose of epinephine in her left arm. Patient was helped to the  floor and her feet were elevated.  RN put on a blood pressure cuff. Before she could get a reading, the paramedics were there and took over. Patient was transported to Hospital.

The body aches were so intense I couldn?t dress myself in the morning. All of my lymph nodes in my neck, ribs, and collar bones were incredibly swollen and hurt when touched. I rotated Tylenol and Advil with no relief. My fatigue was like no other. My headache wouldn?t go away either. 48 hours after the vaccine, I still had body aches and swollen lymph nodes in my neck to the point of pain when turning my neck.

One week from the date of my vaccine, I woke up with a swollen and red arm below the injection site. It was itchy and painful. This has persisted for two days and I saw a physician for it. We are currently monitoring the site for possible cellulitis.

                                                One week after the shot  (1-14-2021) Patient (19 y.o.)reported side pain and appeared constipated, Laxatives given along with Tylenol, on further assessment  Patient was noted to have left leg redness and abdominal fullness.   Dr. was updated  and we had orders for close monitoring, the next day when she got up, her leg appeared better, and she had passed a small BM, but by lunch she had developed significant pain and edema in her left leg, and the color of her leg was reddened again.  She was sent to the emergency room with  her symptoms.   She was admitted back to our facility  yesterday, her diagnoses included Acute provoked left external illiac, femoral, popliteal, and peroneal DVT.  Elevated Factor II levels, Elevated APC resistant, May-Thurner Syndrome, history of developmental disabilities, fecal impaction and urinary retention - suspected related to her fecal impaction.  Vascular surgery was consulted,  and pt. was  started on a heparin drip, and mechanical thrombectomy was needed for both legs due to multiple clots.  She was started on Eliquis and Plavix, and thigh high compression stockings were ordered, ace wraps being used until these are supplied.  Her Fecal impaction was addressed also and the urinary retention resolved.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

Patient presents on 1/27/2021 after onset of pain, decreased ROM ongoing since administration.  I was able to visualize ecchymotic area where vaccine was administered and patient has photo evidence.  The physician responsible for the vaccine administration needs to be retrained on where to give deltoid muscle IM injections and to avoid the extremities where recent surgeries occurred (patient had right shoulder labrum repair in October 2020)

She cam back in side the room and we had a nurse assess her, her BP and heart rate were a  little elevated. We gave her some water and had her sit for some extra time while we talked to her. She has a child hood trauma regarding vaccine and had just had a major panic attack before and during her vaccination. We were all  pretty sure she had just worked her self up and was not feeling well because of that and she said as much herself. After about 15-20 more minutes her BP and heart rate were back to normal and although still feeling a little weak she was ready to go home with her mother.

                                                My fever was through the roof. My body ached so bad I couldn?t walk. I was on fire all over. Then came the adverse event- uncontrollable shaking. This was not a side effect written on the moderna sheet of risks. I was shaking so bad I thought I may have a seizure. I finally settled down and fell asleep. About an hour later, I woke up shaking out of control. I was going to call 911 but my partner was able to grab some NyQuil for me and knocked me out. It was the most terrifying experience of my life and I will not be getting the second shot because of it.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I became extremely dizzy, nauseous, my lips went numb, shortness of breath, weakness, slow reaction times, the inability to operate at my normal speed in thought and action, and I became very lethargic.  I received the vaccine during a shift at work, and I was unable to complete the shift at my normal efficiency or concentration. To my coworkers, I described the feeling as being intoxicated, but not slurring my words. This feeling decreased enough by 9pm where I felt safe to drive home, but it was not completely gone until  approximately 11pm.

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

Next day I had chills, nausea, headache, sore throat, and  shakes. Started the afternoon of the next day.  My arm has been red and itchy since the day, but it is increasing becoming warmed, bigger, and itchier every day since.

                                                On 12/31/2020 I had a headache and I was tired.  Over then next two days my arm was very sore.  That subsided by 1/02/21.  On 1/07/21 I woke up around 8 AM with my arm being sore again and at ejection site I had a red circle. The ejection site was also swollen. I took a benedryl and the pain subsided but the red circle continued to grow.  On 1/08/21 the circle got even bigger (even with taking two 25 mg tablets of benedryl before bed) and it?s warm to the touch.    Also on 1/07/2021 at around 6 pm I began menstrual spotting (this would be in the dead middle of my usual cycle). It continued into today ,1/08/2021. This is unusual for me as I have never experienced spotting in the middle of my cycle.   Also on today 1/08/2021 my arm soreness has returned as the red circle is  growing bigger around the ejection site (approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 inches). I?m also experiencing extra tiredness and a headache.

I left work at 10:30 after realizing how bad I felt and went home. I slept for roughly five hours, from 11am to 3:30ish and then continued to throw up. I could not life my arm past my chest because it was so swollen and sore. I stayed at home and skipped new year&#39;s, going back to sleep around 1030pm. It was not fun

My arm started to have some swelling at the site, but I woke up this morning and the fever, chills, and nausea are still very much present about 24 hours after receiving the first dose.

This headache went away when I woke up the following day.  On Saturday, January 9 I experienced chills, nausea, body aches, and a stiff neck, along with pain in my left arm. The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

                                                The first two days after injection it was painful to lift arm above 30 degrees and hurt upon palpation and I had an overall tiredness. A week after the injection on 1/13/2021 I developed a raised, red rash surrounding the injection site (2in x 4 in). The skin that was inflamed was 101.2 degrees fahrenheit.  The intense rash lasted around 24 hours and subsided after 3 treatments of Benadryl cream and one dose of oral Benadryl. The skin is still slightly raised and has a slight redness to it today (1/15/2021) but is much better than before.

I was barely able to speak, calling out for my brothers to get my mom. I was continuing gasping for air while they called an ambulance. The paramedics arrived and checked my lungs and oxygen. By the time they arrived I was back to normal. I didn?t go to the hospital as they didn?t seem it was necessary and I was feeling okay. Later on in the day I just had some slight chest pain and some shortness of breath but it was gone by the end of the night. I?m completely fine now. I had no other symptoms or side effects.

Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

                                                Immediate burning in arm right after receiving shot. 15 minutes after receiving shot began to feel tired and got a headache. Later on in the evening I had discomfort in my chest and had to use my inhaler. Pain in arm worsened over night; couldn&#39;t move arm at all. Pains spread into armpit and back. Got up at 3am to my body shivering, thinking I was running a fever I checked my temperature and it was normal but upon standing I had extreme dizziness to the point of almost passing&#39;s out, I had to sit down right away. Had nausea and whole body felt very sore an achey. The morning after my shot I woke with a headache, extreme pain in my arm and armpit, soreness all over my body, stomach pains, and my heart rate was high. Throughout the day my symptoms got worse I ran a fever of 102.7 which broke but then came back later on in the evening.  The following day my symptoms started to diminish, no fever and body was feeling better, arm pain and headache continued. Now I am on day 4 still experiencing pain in my arm and armpit, slight headache, but chest pains have started. It feels as if there is a brick on my chest, almost like a burning sensation with occasional pains in left breast as well as tightness in the left side of my neck.

I went back into the room and still couldn&#39;t breathe so they sat me down and told me my whole body was bright red and they stuck me with an epipen. The whole reaction probably lasted a  little less than a minute from the time it happened to when they stuck me with the epipen.

It lasted the night, and then I took ibuprofen 200mg in the morning and throughout the day it got better, but around 3pm, it started to come back, so I took another 200mg ibuprofen. I also didn?t eat anything for fear I would throw it up. Later that evening, it got worse and I became extremely fatigued. I was able to eat some soup and crackers. I took another ibuprofen and couldn?t go to sleep until 4am. The next morning I felt better, with only residual side effects. My left arm was also extremely sore and tender from the time of administration until Feb. 6.

I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

                                                I received the Moderna Vaccine on 12/28/2020. I had no immediate reactions. By 6-7pm that night I started having severe pain in my right arm. The next morning 12/29/2020 I woke up with a migraine and still had severe pain in my arm. That night (12/29/2020) I began feeling aches and pains throughout my body and felt that into the next morning (12/30/2020). The evening of 12/30/2020 I noticed a dollar coin sized red spot on my arm that was warm to the touch and was slightly raised. (By this time my arm pain had decreased but was still present.) The red spot had grown slightly by 12/31/2020 but not much. Friday 01/01/2021 I hadn&#39;t payed much attention to the spot but it looked the same. The morning of 01/02/2021 I woke up and had noticed that the spot had taken over a large portion of the outer bicep on my right arm.

On 12/28/2020 noticed the pain was back and I now have a medium sized lump in my armpit that was causing pain. On 12/31/2020 began to have a rash around the injection site that was increasing in size and limiting arm mobility. PCH EH sent CG to WorkMed and CG was given Rx for Keflex which was completed on 01/07/2021--CG stated symptoms are greatly improve.

                                                Less than 24 hours after receiving the vaccine (Jan 7), I started experiencing bad stomach pain, which a family friend had also experienced after she received the vaccine (also ~24 hours later). It did not subside with time, and became feeling like a shooting pain that was coming and going in waves, and I could not sleep that night. I was nauseous at one point, and threw up. I drank water throughout the night, which seemed to help a little bit and was taking an NSAID. The following day (Jan 8), the shooting pain continued, and I was in bed all day. I became nauseous at one point during the day, when attempting to move a piece of furniture, but did not throw up. I continued taking NSAIDs, which did not help. I was able to sleep through the night after taking melatonin, but was in discomfort. The following day (Jan 9), I woke up, and the shooting stomach pain had radiated to my chest, and had not subsided. I called my PCP, who I was unable to see due to timing/distance from the office, and she recommended I go to an ED if I did not feel better. As the pain was in my chest, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it had radiated there or was cardiac related, I had a friend drive me to the ED. My results came back normal at the ED, and the PA was only able to tell me that it was GI related, due to the pain in my stomach/esophagus. She was unsure if it&#39;s GERD, gas trapped, or some other GI issue. I am still experiencing this pain (Jan 11), but have somewhat managed it by taking Tums and eating alkaline foods.

I had severe joint and muscle pain. I had the chills and could not stop shaking.  I was very weak and could not even move out of bed, Leading to me calling 911 for an ambulance at 10:21pm. They kept me in the Emergency department until 5:30am because they could not get my heart rate to stay down. Stony Brook nurse told me it was okay to get vaccine even though I was infected with COVID-19 ON 12/15/2020.

                                                I recieved the first dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/5/21 and did not experience any adverse reactions in the days following. Then, on 1/13/21 (8 days post vaccine) I noticed hives covering most of my body. My face was tingling and my lips were swollen. I took an antihistamine that evening hoping it would go away. The day after 1/14/21 I woke up with the hives all over my body, especially on my face. They were very severe and itchy. I went to my dermatologist and they recommended a steroid cream and oral antihistamine to help reduce the itching. It is now 1/15/20, and the hives are still covering most of my body with severe hives on my face.

This continued but then completely stopped 2 hours later, weirdly it returned exactly 24 hours later only not as extreme. I feel fine now but I also felt the need to call 911 during this episode.

I got back in bed and my arm was 8/10 pain so I also thought faintness could possibly due to pain.  7:15am I got up to go to work and quickly felt very warm and my vision started to go black. I laid back down for a few minutes until this resolved. I took my temperature and it was 99.0. I got up again and started to get ready but began feeling light headed again. I ended up getting ready while sitting down because I kept feeling too much like I was going to pass out. I ate breakfast and felt fine. 8:00am I left for work and after driving for about 5 minutes I felt myself getting very warm again and light-headed. I ended up pulling over and calling for someone to come pick me up.  9:00am My temperature was 99.5. My blood pressure laying down was 110/74 and HR was 74. After standing for 5 minutes my BP was 90/70 and my HR was 92. During this 5 minutes of standing I felt myself getting warm again but my vision did not start to go black and I was able to stand for the full 5 minutes.  At various times throughout the day I would feel faint if I was standing or sitting upright for too long. The last time I felt this was was probably 11:30pm on 1/15/21. 1/16/21 - No light-headedness or warmth. Did feel some slight chest pressure, but nothing crazy and it only lasted maybe half of the day.

She reported the itching resolved after the medications and then she is still complaining of breast pain.  She noticed 2 drops of fluid out of her right nipple.  I do not necessarily know that this is an allergic reaction I am just not sure what to make of the coincidence with the Covid immunization it could be entirely unrelated.  Advised follow-up with her PCP regarding these issues.  Return precautions discussed.  She verbalized agreement and understanding with plan of care.  Sent home from ED.

                                                Right after the injection, I had minor arm soreness which increased as the day went on. Approximately 12 hours after the injection I started feeling very tired and achy. My arm hurt very badly and I started getting chills. About an hour later I had a 101.1 degree fever. I also experienced very slight shortness of breath which went away when I used my albuterol inhaler. My shoulder where I got the injection hurt so badly that I could like raise it, lie on it or touch it really.   The fever continued into the night but was gone by around 9am.   I continued to feel tired and achy all day the next day, with occasional shooting headache pains. I did feel better and better as the day went on though.   Question: I take a daily supplement of 6g of marine collagen. I happened to take the marine collagen 1 hour before the onset of chills and fever - could there be a correlation between the collagen and the worsening symptoms? I have never had any type of reaction to the collagen before and have been taking it for about 3 weeks.

It went away and I had body aches later that day and the next day. Thursday I had a red spot on my arm below the injection site. The following week my whole upper arm  was swollen and I couldn&#39;t lift it , I went to the urgent care, they gave me antibiotics 500 mg 4x daily. The meds made me really sick and I quit taking it. and I started feeling better

                                                I received my vaccine while I was at work around 1400. Around midnight I woke up shivering and could not get warm. My heart rate was elevated but that could have been related to my anxiety. I layered clothing on and finally managed to sleep. Upon waking up around 6 the next morning, I had a temperature of 102, a sore throat, throbbing headache, and was vomiting. My arm was so sore and swollen that I could hardly touch it. After rest, Tylenol, and fluids, I felt better around 8 that evening.

                                                28 hours post vaccine I noticed a rash on my chest and upper back.   The rash was not raised and did not itch, but there was a mild tingling sensation to it.  40 hours post vaccine the rash  included my neck, stomach, upper back, and chest.   The rash was not raised and did not itch, but there was a mild tingling sensation to it.  The rash seemed to be the most intense between 40 to 44 hours post vaccine.  Following 44 hours post vaccine the rash began to gradually lighten and the tingling disappeared.  At 52 hours post vaccine the rash was barely noticeable in color with no tingling.

On top of that my armpit area was severely sore . Soreness and pain from the arm continued 2 weeks later.

At work (noon), suddenly became very lightheaded, cold, sweaty,  experienced blackout vision around periphery and felt faint and nauseous. Threw up. Went home and had extreme chills and could not get warm. Nausea subsided around 6:00pm 1/27. Headache and neck soreness continues still today (1/30). Headache feels like pressure inside my head, pushing and causing dull pain at the base of my skull and top of neck.

My arm hurt and swelled up for a few days with a large red bump. After a few days the bump went away. Im still having headaches, ive had diarrhea from day 1. I already struggle with my bowels and go to the bathroom way to much already and after given the vaccine those next days and still days continuing after I cant stay out of the bathroom. In 6 hours i had over 7 to 10 bowel movements and I hadnt ate a thing. As i thought I was getting better I woke uo the next day with my throat swelled up and i was all congested like a cold my body is very tired very sore a very light cough formed as well too my breathing is ok so far, my body on the inside feels like its on fire but im cold on the outside, one minute i was cold them im burning up. Its making me very overwhelmed and my nerves are all over the place.

He had given it to me in my SUV. My arm was so sore for 2 days to where I could barley even lift it. I struggled so hard to do basic things and had to rest my arm and switch between hot and cold treatments for those 2 days. Still nothing really helped. I couldnt even lift my arm above my head without using my other arm to help support it. Even when i did that, it still was so painful.  The night of getting the second shot, I had body aches and a fever that reached 100.2.  As the days went  one i was able to move my arm more and more but i still have pain when  i move my shoulder a certain way.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

The patient also noted &#34;tingling&#34; in her right arm where she received the vaccine.  In addition, there was localized erythema at the injection site with about 5 cm in diameter.  I gave the patient 37 mg of Benadryl and the edema immediately was reduced in addition to the erythema resolved.  She had no more tingling.  I observed her for 30 minutes and all was fine with the patient.  I then checked on her 1 hour later and all was good.

I was also nauseous and had a difficult time keeping food down.  I was also very tired and slept longer than I normally do.  I had my vaccine done on 12/30/2020 and the symptoms did not occur until 1/01/2021. An hour or so after the injection, my arm started to become sore. It was very sore until 1/3/2021. They lasted until 1/3/2021. Now I feel fine.

I woke up a little before 1030PM shaking with chills and nauseated. I couldn&#39;t sleep the whole night, going between sweating and shaking. The next day 1/6/21 I was still unwell, didn&#39;t go into work, felt weak and sore the whole day and noticed my underarm of the arm I received the shot was swollen and painful,. Today 1/7/21, my underarm is still painful and swollen, but the nausea has subsided. Still slightly going between sweating and being chilled.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

                                                From 8am till about 10am I felt shaky after the injection. I dint feel like chills, had no temperature. I could not stop shaking, felt like a deep muscle shake.  I felt shaky and jittery from 8am till 11am. I had a cup of tea where I was able to fall asleep.  I had a telemedicine call and I spoke to a NP and she recommended to go to an ER but I did not go. I just felt very anxious.

                                                I had head pressure that felt like a headache In my temples and the back of my skull around 9-10 hours after the vaccine. Left arm pain starting about 11 hours after shot. Difficult to move arm without intense pain and intense pain at the slightest touch of the arm on or around the vaccination spot. Starting the morning after the vaccination, my glands in my neck were tender and aching like they do when I?m fighting off a cold, I had body aches that you would get if you had a fever for the entire day all over my body. I took ibuprofen that night and they started to go away and I felt hot like I was breaking a fever. I woke up the next morning which is 2 days after the vaccination and felt completely back to normal besides residual arm pain. This pain is bearable and I can move my arm with only a dull pain and I can touch the spot without intense pain however it is still painful.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, January 5th at 9:00 AM. I felt fine immediately following the vaccine but quickly felt worse throughout the day. I developed a fever of 101.4F with medicine, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and general malaise. I know these are all common symptoms, so I didn&#39;t worry too much. However, my fever has persisted. I stayed home from work Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday due to not feeling well and still having a fever. Thursday, I also developed pain in my armpit with movement and palpation. I am guessing that pain in related to swollen lymph nodes. Friday, the pain in my armpit seemed to spread into my arm. Most of my armpit and the upper inside of my bicep is extremely tender to movement and touch. Today, I still have some tenderness in my arm and my fever is still present. Throughout this week, my fever has remained around 100F, even with Tylenol and ibuprofen.   I contacted my PCP yesterday about my concern for my persistent fever and arm pain. They believe that because I tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020, that I am reacting to the first dose of the vaccine as if I am receiving the second dose of the vaccine. They advised me to continue taking ibuprofen and Tylenol. I am worried that if I receive the second dose of the vaccine, I will be sick for longer.

                                                Patient reported feeling like her tongue was tingling and felt larger than normal. She did not report having any difficulty breathing.  25mg of Benadryl was given orally.  After 10 minutes she thought she was feeling a bit better, but then continued to say that she was having tingling and not &#34;feeling normal&#34;.  We decided to administer epinephrine instead of waiting for her to continue to get worse.  I administered an epi-pen (0.3mg) about 30 minutes after she took the Benadryl and a nurse from the SNF called 911.  Paramedics arrived and evaluated her.  Her breathing sounded okay via the paramedic&#39;s stethoscope.  Because she was still not reporting feeling &#34;back to normal&#34; and because she had epinephrine administered, she was transported via ambulance to the ER for continued monitoring.

                                                Gradual onset of soreness beginning about an hour post-vaccine and worsening throughout day. By the evening, left arm pain was too uncomfortable to wash dishes and lift household objects. Pain woke me up at 3am that night and I could not push the covers off of me, dress or undress, and I experienced severe pain with slight movement (7/10). Nausea and cold sweats began around 5am and lasted for 45min. I contacted the nurse via messaging system and was told to take OTC nausea medicine and Tylenol. I took the maximum dosage for Tylenol that day but could not do my normal school functions. The next day I was still limited by pain but did not require medication to cope. By day three, I had full range of motion back and minimal pain. Day four I am back to exercising normally.

It became very painful by the time I went to bed. 10x worse than a flu shot Next morning at 8am, got up and almost passed out. Went back to bed. Got up at 10. Arm was painful to move.  Began fever at 12 noon.  Highest was 102. Terrible chills and aches and pains throughout entire body... lasted through bedtime. Tylenol did not  manage the symptoms. Day 3 I was much better. I did experience fatigue, but arm pain was wearing off quickly.

I went to the Emergency Department and got Prednisone, Pepcid, and Benadryl.  The next day, I started to experience tremors, mostly in my right hand.   Two days later, I was so dizzy that the room was spinning and I could hardly stand up. Did not receive treatment for it.

                                                A few hours after receiving the vaccine I had muscle soreness onset in L deltoid near site of injection. A few hours after that I had moderate soreness in L deltoid, down L arm (bicep/tricep), and up into L pec and trap. I had difficulty abducting L arm to 90 deg but was not hindered in normal movements. Approaching midnight that day the soreness was improving and by mid next day it was limited to L deltoid upon palpation. After 2-3 days soreness resolved. No other adverse effects noted.   I have had very minor muscle soreness to a few vaccinations before, but not this bad. In those cases it has been limited to site of injection (deltoid) and less severe. Usually I don&#39;t notice anything after injections and I&#39;ve never had any other adverse effects.

                                                Patient only had muffin and coffee that day early in am. Had some arm pain after shot no other reaction.  Did go home felt some nausea . Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

                                                Following the second phase around 5pm the intense feeling being extremely cold and despite being under 4 covers and a heated blanket I did not find relief. At this time the injection site was inflamed and painful to the slightest touch and beginning to experience a severe headache   I took Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL and ibuprofen 800. 5am I am waking up with a fever of 101.7, stiff hands, and a continuation of the headache and body aches from the night. I again took ibuprofen 800, and 2 Tylenols extra strength (as needed) every 4 hours,  and Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL in the morning and evening.  My body temperature seemed to have fluctuated every hour being unbearably cold to blood boiling hot with every move I make painful to the point of being bed ridden and needing assistance to get up to go to the restroom.  My injection site has grown from the size of a quarter on Friday Morning 1/22 to  about the size of grapefruit by Sunday 1/24 . I have pictures documenting its growth.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

                                                Approximately 9 days following vaccine administration  raised red,  itchy  bumps appeared on the backs of hands, wrists, and elbows. The following day my fingers were sore. Three hours later red bumps erupted on my fingers and palms. Three days following the initial bumps, more bumps appeared on the bottom and tops of toes. Hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl provide minimal relief. The bumps continue to appear 16 days following  administration. The bumps are comparable to the bumps I experience when taking amoxicillin following Epstein Barr virus.

                                                Approximately a week after my first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, I developed a red welt at and around the site of injection on my left arm. The welt is very firm and slightly tender to the touch, blanches when pressure is applied, and occasionally itchy. My arm is also sore I am still experience extreme fatigue. No treatment or medications have been taken to alleviate these symptoms at the time of this report submission.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, I had redness around the injection site and a sore arm for about 2-3 days. I received the shot on a Tuesday, and by the weekend my arm felt fine. One week later (Monday 25th), I felt like I had a light fever. My temperature was 99.1F. Tuesday, my left arm where I received the injection was SO SUPER itchy. When I looked at it, there was a huge, red, swollen, bump. The area was about the size of a credit card. The area was also HOT to the touch even though the rest of my arm felt like a normal temperature. From Tuesday 26th through Wednesday 27th (time of reporting), I still have the big, red, hot bump at the injection site, and my fever fluctuates in between 99.1-100.4F. I contacted my doctor who believes it is most likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He has advised me to take benadryl and tylenol, and if I still have the fever tomorrow, he will test me for strep, flu, and COVID. I have not taken the benadryl and tylenol long enough to see if there is any sort of impact. I should also mention that I get tested weekly for COVID at work, and my test from Monday January 25 has come back as negative.

                                                Within about 20 minutes post injection, patient stated she felt &#34;itchy&#34;. I gave her diphenhydramine and she swallowed it. At about 30 minutes post injection, she stated she had small bumps on her bilateral arms. They were hard for me to discern but she also claimed the bumps were painful.  I asked about any labored breathing or chest tightening and she denied both. After about ~45-50, she still stated the same itchiness and pain. Visually there was no change in my opinion. Patient then conferred with  supervisors at her employment about her next steps. Her PCP was closed and she was deciding if she wanted to go to urgent care. That&#39;s the last interaction I had.

Immunizing pharmacist yelled out for Rapid Response from the ER.  Emergency room staff was on scene within 1 minute.  They measured patients pulse and BP and took her to the emergency room for monitoring.  Patient was gone from immunizing area for 30 minutes.  She came back to see us, looking much better and said that she faints all the time.  She remarked she was glad she was seated because when she faints when she stands and hits her head she has a sore head for days.  She proceeded to schedule her second vaccination utilizing the QR reader we had provided to all patients.  Although she didn&#39;t tell us beforehand, afterward she told us she faints all the time, that it isn&#39;t unusual, and that she had deliberately eaten food and drank plenty of liquids before she came so that it wouldn&#39;t be a problem.  Patient stated that she was fine and fit to drive and unconcerned about the reaction.

Around lunch today (01/04/21) I was moving my neck around and when I move it to the left it rolls over something. I began to feel around the area and noticed that where the sore area is I have a rather large knot. It is a hard knot that is very tender and sore. No other signs and symptoms present. I have not been to a doctor or clinic regarding the issue. I was unsure if this issue was directly related with the vaccine or not.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA; On 12/30/2020 I began experiencing soreness in my left arm along with a short period of chills and body aches. The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

                                                awoke at 2 am  with nausea, chills, generalized pain. Immediately felt myself start to pass out or have a seizure- I am not sure which. Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

                                                After receiving the vaccine i just felt pain on my right arm. Took 600mg of ibuprofen around 8:30pm and went to bed. Upon waking up the next morning (today) at 7am, I felt very weak. I ate breakfast by 8am and head to work. The weakness persisted, by 10am when I went to the restroom I felt as if i was going to collapse from how weak I felt while standing.  Felt some chills as if my chest was breathing in cold air. By 10:40am I was home in bed resting. Had a moderate headache and chills, weakness persisted. At 12:50pm I had  a fever of 100.9 F. I drank water, took 600mg ibuprofen and ate an orange. Around 2pm I felt strong enough to get up and take a short walk. At 3:00pm my temperature was 99.8 F, chills were gone. Weakness had improved. No more headache.  At 4:45pm temperature at 99.2 F. And feeling better. I took lunch around 3pm

                                                Almost 48 hours after the vaccine I woke up with hives flush to my skin along my R&amp;L arms, under my arms, on my left hand, insides of both thighs, and around my ankles. My skin felt hot but minimally itchy. The insides of my hands and burn when I wash them and they feel really sore. The bottoms of my feet also felt like they were burning when I took a shower. Nothing in my diet or hygiene products have changes. I took a half dose of Benadryl at 11am today and the hives are still there along with the pain in my hands when washing them. I coordinated with my PCP and they recommended self monitoring and Benadryl.

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

                                                Shot given at noon- at 3:30PM I started having nausea, vomiting, headache, vertigo, muscle aches and feeling very tired. These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

                                                A few hours after the first dose (1/15), a welt grew around the injection site about the size of a silver dollar.  This went away after three days. Arm was sore for the first two days.  One week later (1/22), injection site became itchy, red and was very warm to the touch.  A welt formed as well. It started out the size of a silver dollar, and over the course of  48 hours the welt, itchiness, and redness grew to  the size of a large russet potato (Friday 1/22- Saturday1/23).  It was the most red around the injection site, with the most red being about the size of a silver dollar.  After 48 hours, it remained itchy, red, and had a welt  for the next 24 hours  (Sunday 1/24). The next morning (Monday 1/25) redness and swelling were gone but site was still a little itchy.  Site was only slightly tender throughout these three days but not painful. No other side effects were noticed i.e. fever, chills, chest pain.  Slight dizziness was felt if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything.

                                                When I was eating chips I wanted to lick my fingers and my mouth felt funny. I looked in the mirror and my face looked fine. The following day I noticed half of my face was paralyzed and I went to urgent care. The Dr. diagnosed me with Bells Palsy and put me on antibiotics for 10days. I asked for more because it wasn&#39;t healing, but hey didn&#39;t me anymore. Maybe a week after I did a phone visit and asked If I should get more medicine and they said no. Maybe a week ago from today 1/27/21 I seen my PCP and she contacted the Neurology department at medical center regarding  my situation. After about 3 weeks of having this im about 90% better.

Sudden confusion, burning heat and hives and burning red rash spreading from injection site, up neck and throat and down arm to hand. 5 days after the injection, a severe allergic reaction occurred where my entire body broke into hives and a red burning rash, again starting at the injection site. Throat tightness, itchiness in scalp and groin, and difficulty concentrating (all my usual symptoms of anaphylaxis) occurred. Advised by health care provider to take Benadryl immediately and to have epi-pens on hand. Loratadine was prescribed.

Flu like symptoms starting that evening (unsure what time, as I was trying to sleep). Arm soreness where I received the vaccine, muscle aches that kept waking me up throughout the night, headache, fever, slight congestion, chills and sweating, nausea, dizziness when I stand up, fatigue. As of 4:00 PM on 1/29 (the day after the vaccine) I am still experiencing this list of flu-like symptoms.

I couldn&#39;t; I was stuck in the state of my body shaking and unable to see anything. After the two times, I had the shakes.

                                                I received my vaccine at 9 am 02/01/21 and felt exhausted that evening. My arm of injection, was extremely sore and it was hard to sleep. I had chills and night sweats and woke up with my heart racing at 150 bpm. My resting heart rate is usually 90-100. When I finally got up to go to work, I felt dizzy and completely off balance, bumping into walls.  I  feel extremely nauseous, weak and have a migraine.

                                                Monday morning woke up with arm soreness, headache, fatigue and feeling slightly warm. After a few hours, and a nap, I had a fever of 101.9 along with chills, severe fatigue and severe nausea.  After a 2 more hours my fever raised to 103.3, I had muscle cramping in my legs, nausea, headache and fatigue.  All of those symptoms lasted until 9pm that night when the fever resolved.  The following day I still had slight warmness, a temperature of 99 and headache, chills and fatigue/weakness.  All of those symptoms, continued until Thursday evening.  On Friday morning I woke up with no headache (only mild intermittent head pains), mild fatigue and arm soreness.  Every day this week my heartrate has been higher than normal with the average rate around 120-130BPM. This was at rest, without any caffeine or other stimulants.  I took alternating tylenol (1000mg) and ibuprofen (800mg) all 4 days.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                Starting around 9AM I began noticing a high heart rate while inactive. My heart rate was at 140 bpm (measured manually and with Watch). Normal for me is between 80-100 bpm. My heart rate remained high (between 120-140 bpm) for about 6 hours. I did not notice it go down to 100bpm until the next day. The high heart rate was never provoked by any physical activity. I rested in bed or in a chair all day and drank lots of water. Throughout the day I had fluctuating periods of feeling very hot and very cold. I took 1000mg of Tylenol every 4 hours throughout the day.  I also experienced expected side effects (chills, joint aches, muscle aches, nausea, headache, fever (100F w/ Tylenol)).

Had patient wait to get vaccine until end of day at  Living Center which has a connecting hall to ER. Gave vaccine and began monitoring patient for signs of reaction.

She was told that she had an overheating reaction to the vaccine and sent home an hour later. The day after, patient complained of mild flu like symptoms but felt fine otherwise.

I woke up at 1am with a temp of 102.7, drenched in sweat, and shaking so badly my partner thought I was having a seizure. I did not seek treatment, because I was able to sleep after taking Tylenol and having my partner use cold washcloths and ice packs on my neck, forehead, back, and chest. I also attempted to take a shower, but I was so weak I required assistance to walk to the bathroom. I had similar side effects the next night although less intense.

                                                I had no immediate reactions to the vaccine. About an hour after my injection I developed a low grade headache. The next day, 2/26, I woke at 7am with a headache still. The headache and fatigue worsened through the day (2/26/21).  Around 3:00pm I started experiencing waves of dizziness. By 4pm I had begun experiencing temporary loss of feeling in  various body parts. Each part&#39;s loss of feeling came and went separately and lasted about 2-5 minutes each. I experienced this in my left facial cheek, both wrists and hands, and my right hip. I had a coworker drive me home and by 5pm I had a migraine with severe sinus/head pressure and a fever of 99.4. My average resting body temperature is 97.4. I slept from 6:00pm friday till 10:30am on Saturday (2/27). When I woke I still had a headache, but no longer a migraine.  I spent 2/27 dizzy, weak, and achy but no more episodes of lack of feeling in body parts or a fever.  I have not experienced soreness in the arm I got my injection in, but I noticed on Tuesday March 2nd that I my injection site is very swollen, red and itchy. The swelling and redness (to my knowledge) has not gotten worse or better since then, but the itching has gotten worse and the actual puncture wound is now visible since yesterday (3/4) whereas it was not visible anytime  before  that.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? The day I got the vaccine all that happened was a dead arm and then when I was driving home after the 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The next day my arm was sore to move, but not at the injection spot, if looking at my arm (someone else) it was down 3 inches and to the left about 1 inch. The next day that same spot was still sore but to the touch, then it went away.    What is more interesting and concerning is that on 1/6/2021 (a week after I got the shot), I noticed 3 little bumps on my arm (9:45pm), in that same location that was sore to move and touch on day 2 and 3 but they also were itchy. When I woke up the next morning (6:15 am) the area had spread to the size of my palm (3 inch by 3 inch roughly)  it was all red, hard to the touch,  stilly itchy and I had the feeling of a dead arm again. One of the nurses at my work drew a circle around the red spot so we could watch to see if it was still growing , by roughly 11:45 am it had grown an additional 2 inches.

I started to feel chills and back pain around 7 pm.  Throughout the night my arm was throbbing and I had a hard time sleeping. I woke up around 12 am to use the restroom. My body felt VERY heavy and weak. I woke up today (1 day after the shot) and felt better.  However, my arm still has severe pain and I experiencing fatigue. I also feel like the back pain goes in and out.

However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

The vaccine was administered to my left arm without complication at approximately 1:00pm (my scheduled appointment). I proceeded to the area designated for patients to be observed after receiving the vaccine and was asked to wait 15 minutes. I recall getting to the observation area then telling my spouse I felt unwell - after the event he notified me that I told him I was about to pass out and asked him to get medical help. I lost consciousness approximately 5-10 minutes following the vaccine. My husband reported that after losing consciousness I seemed to have a minor seizure, as evidenced by my head jerking and my arms and fingers &#34;tensing and curling up&#34;.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of my car at this time, so I suffered no fall or fall related injury. Public health officials and EMT responded. They indicated to my spouse that I had experienced a vasovagal syncope episode and that I had &#34;gone tonic&#34;/ had a &#34;tonic seizure&#34;.  They took my blood pressure, which was very low (I don&#39;t recall exactly but it was 80 over something). They also took my blood sugar among other things that I do not recall.  I was given oxygen and put into an ambulance. I was shaking, so they wrapped me in blankets. I believe they may have done an EKG and placed a blood pressure cuff while I was in the ambulance, but I do not recall any specifics about this. The EMT also drew my blood, placed an IV, and administered IV fluids while I was in the ambulance. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency department

The soreness was so intense that I felt nauseous when I moved my arm or bumped the injection site. About 11 hours after the injection a severe headache began. Roughly 19 hours after the injection muscle fatigue and overall tiredness began, headache remained as well as arm soreness. About 30 hours after the injection all the symptoms above were present in addition to a fever. Currently it is about 54 hours after the injection and only a slight headache and slight arm soreness remain.

Elaboration: the pain in my body was global and severe. At a time I could not move because my spine and neck felt like they were in fire. I also felt like vomiting, but could not. These symptoms continued through the night and into the next day with periods of feeling extremely hot and sweating and having chills like ice and sweating.

By 11:30pm I could not move my arm and also could not pick my son up who  weighs 30 pounds. On the following day I continued with severe  body aches  and joint pain. I went to see a doctor about 10:00am who examined me and advised my to take Tylenol and Ibuprofen  for pain.  They did a Covid-19 swab which as negative.  My symptoms are improving and I can say that it took about 24 to 48 hours to recover from my right arm.

                                                Several minutes after the vaccine she became light headed, EMT evaluated her and stated she was tachycardic (did not give a pulse) and was initially unable to find a BP.  She appeared pale and was crying and hyperventilating.  She stated she had a funny feeling in her throat and numbness in her fingers.  We prepared to administer an epi-pen but she was increasingly anxious so we had to place her in a supine position first.  Immediately she started to feel better, her color was normal and her blood pressure was 110/70 with a pulse of 67.  Her throat no longer felt ?funny.?  We continued to monitor her and did NOT administer epinephrine.  An ambulance arrived and she was ambulatory and feeling normal so declined transport. Follow-up with patient 1/18/21, she states she is feeling good. She said she and her mother both have a history of passing out with any procedure involving needles and she does not feel her symptoms were caused by the vaccine itself. She plans to receive her scheduled 2nd dose from us.

                                                strong shivering occurred around 10:00pm at night. I got out of bed and felt very cold and began shivering. I went back into bed at about 10:40pm still shivering. When I woke up around 3 or 4  in the morning I was no longer experiencing the shivers.   The following day on Friday, I felt fatigued, but it was hard  to tell what from, because I was also experiencing the first day of my menses.  The fatigue felt different because it was my entire body as opposed to the fatigue I feel just in my legs during my menstruation.

I am currently pending a CT Scan to check for brain bleeding.

                                                About 30 min after the vaccination I felt dizzy. It felt almost like I had gotten up too quickly and felt dizzy, that kind of dizziness. Lots of soreness on the injection site the day of the vaccination and also going down the arm if I tried to lift my arm it was painful, everything else was fine until 4:30PM when I started feeling chills and feverish. Around 9PM the cold chills were so awful I started crying because it was so uncomfortable. I took some Tylenol and it knocked me out. I felt cold and hot during the night. About 7AM the next morning I had hives, on my chest, arms and legs (red itchy, swollen) the chills have gone away in the morning. I took an Allegra around 8AM and it did work after 30 min to an hour. Then I went to see my allergist around 11AM and  the itchiness and redness had gone down a lot but the itchiness was still there. The allergist told me to take some more Allegra that day and it ended up working.

BS was checked and was low so I was given crackers and a sprite. I was severly nauseaed and HR elevated to 150 with SOB associated and was like that off and on for about 30 minutes which prompted EMS to be called to come check me out and was transported to the ED.  I was given fluids and my lab work showed I was deydrated. UA neg, Triponin-neg, EKG-tackycardia and they symptoms deminished on its on after about 4-5 hours and I was released from the ED.

                                                At the time of the vaccination, I experienced a sore arm for about 48 hours, and muscle aches and chills for about 12 hours.   7 days after receiving the vaccination, I noticed a rash at the injection site. It was somewhat itchy for 2 days, and continue to grew in size for 4 days. The rash was improved by taking over the counter allergy medicine (Allegra 24 hour). It was slightly raised and swollen the first 2 days, but decreased over the following days although the rash itself got larger.  I did not seek medical attention because I did not have any other symptoms or side effects with the rash, and was able to self-treat with allergy meds.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

And I also had it on my right side not so strong as the left side.

After discussion with physician on site it was decided a full dose to right arm would be provided as it was unclear how much vaccine patient received appropriately. Patient expressed no adverse effects when contacted two days post injection other than soreness of arms. Syringe which was used to give first dose to left arm was not retrievable, injection technique appeared standard, no other event reported during vaccination clinic

                                                The day after the vaccine I started spotting  and my back started getting numbness down my legs. I kept moving my legs because I was afraid I was going to lose feeling in them. I got an X-ray and it showed there is nothing wrong with my back and I concluded it has to be from the vaccine because it has resolved for the most part after 3 weeks. I was extremely fatigued for 3 days and my left cervical and right axillary lymph  nodes were swollen. I had a huge welt at the injection site for 2 weeks and now there?s still a bruise there. I am afraid to get my second vaccine because I don?t want to lose feeling in my legs. I need guidance from someone who knows a lot about this vaccine because no one is able to give me guidance.

                                                Approximately five minutes after receiving the shot, I began to feel a burst of pain rush through my entire left arm. A few seconds afterwards, I started to feel nauseated. Immediately, I felt weak, light-headed, and tired. I began to sweat profusely, as well. I could barely move my arm to flag down one of attendants who was monitoring us. She asked me what was wrong, and I tried to describe what was going on, but I could barely talk or keep my eyes open. She radioed for help and the paramedics came over to me. They wanted to move me to a private room and asked if I could walk. I tried to walk there, but I started to fall so one of the paramedics hoisted me up to help me. They asked me some questions will they were waiting for a stretcher, all of which I could hear and understand, but I was unable to response to. The stretcher came and I laid down, but I was already starting to feel better by then. I was very out of it, but I think this entire process took maybe 10-15 minutes. I laid there for maybe another 15 minutes, and I began to be able to talk again and open my eyes. I tried sitting up and that went alright. I answered some questions for them while they took my blood pressure, monitored my pulse, and took my temperature. After another 15 minutes or so, I felt well enough to walk back to my office in the Health Department. I didn&#39;t have any other problems for the rest of the day.

                                                About one hour after injection: I had a burning sensation in chest and throat and swelling feeling; I felt a bit of throat swelling. I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

On 2/3 my arm felt very warm, so I looked at it in a mirror and found a large, round/hexagonal area of swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness. Today is 2/6 and it continues to spread the redness, swelling, and warmth down towards my elbow. It occasionally itches, but is usually painful and stings.

My 9pm I felt dizzy, had a headache, and started feeling nauseous  I took some Tylenol and ibuprofen and a snack (can?t take it on an empty stomach when nauseous  Was able to fall sleep but woke up at 2am very shaky, nauseous, and with extreme joint pain. I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

On 26 Jan 2021, the patient was still paralyzed on her right side, unable to walk, had shooting pain feeling, and two fingers on her right hand were able to move but still felt tingly. The doctors planned to discharge her on the next day to a rehab center because she could not function alone.  Treatment for the event included pain medication and hospitalization.

                                                I was hurting a lot. 8 out of 10 - the pain. My arm was so but my chest was in pain. I couldn&#39;t breathe. I was so light headed I thought I would pass out if I stood up. I went to ER - Dr thought it was  from my wearing personal protection equipment - mask and goggles for work after receiving the vaccine. He told me I was fine but I was so much in  pain that I was too out of it to ask for tests. I was in pain for two week. Chest was in pain.  I had to use my inhaler once a day at least - sometimes more.

Pain went down the back/side of both arms and into my hands (chilled hands, electric shock feeling, tingling and pain). Now on gabapentin 2x/day, nerve pain is still there (one month later) but much better than it was.

She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I noticed extreme tiredness and light headedness. I got up to notify staff and my vision went and I began to feel nauseated. They helped me to a seat and I began sweating profusely and the nausea intensified. After several minutes the nausea and vision changes subsided and I continued to feel extremely tired and light headed.  The staff put a heart rate monitor on me and I saw that my heart rate was sitting around 38-42. I felt like I just wanted to close my eyes but the staff kept asking me questions. After several more minutes a cop arrived. Later on an ambulance arrived and when they put the blood pressure cuff on I noticed tingling in my hand from it. I continued to feel light headed and extremely tired through arriving at the hospital via ambulance around 10:30am. These symptoms gradually subsided throughout the afternoon leaving me with light headedness  only when walking or moving around. While at the hospital they did an EKG which showed inverted T waves (from what I remember of the PA&#39;s description) and so admitted me for observation and performed an echo which came back normal. I was discharged around 10pm on the same night.
