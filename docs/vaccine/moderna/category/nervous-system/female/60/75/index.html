Was discharged after receiving IV fluids, lab tests, EKG.  About 5 hours later, I developed a low grade fever of 99.7, blood pressure 142/92, chills,  general malaise and body aches.  Symptoms started dissipating later in the evening.  Started feeling better as the day progressed the next day.

When I woke up a few hours later, I noticed that I had a very bad headache and all-over body aches, and I felt like I had the flu.  Weak, nauseous and extremely tired.  I went to bed and slept through the night, when my alarm woke me at 7:00 am on Tuesday, January 5, I got up to use the bathroom and felt all the same symptoms from the night before, only worse.  I noticed that I had a rash on my left arm below the injection site.  I called in sick and went back to bed.  I slept from approximately 7:30 to 2:00 pm on January 5.  I felt a little better upon awakening, but had a very bad headache and no appetite.  The other body aches seemed better.

                                                Severe arm pain at the site of the injection  which started 24 hours after injection and persisting through today - day 9  postvaccine. The pain is lateral upper right arm and descends inferiorly toward the elbow. No redness or swelling at the site.  I&#39;m having great difficulty with sleep because of the pain.  The pain is aggravated by  motion.  The pain is helped somewhat with ibuprofen 200 mg every 6-8 hours.

At times my face still feels funny and I have had a headache every day for the past 6 days.

                                                First, let me say that I had a diagnosed case of Coronavirus in April of 2020 last year.  I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

                                                1-8-2021:  9:25 body shaking, nostrils constricting, throat tightening and legs weak.  Happen while I was heading home.  Returned to HD.  EMT administered 50ml benedryl and pushed 125ml saline.  No response.  Throat felt tight, not closed but tight.  Offered EpiPen .3 agreed.  Body reaction - shaking.  Went to Hospital ER via ambulance (~11am).  ER administered 50mg steroid and had 2 puffs of albuterol inhaler twice.  Became very tired but felt heart raced - assumed reaction to steroid/albuterol.  2:30pm started to finally feel relief.  Discharged 4pm with rx for prednisone 50mg 1/day-10 days and benedryl 25mg for that night and am/pm next day.  O2 dropped to 94 that evening.  Administered 3 rounds of 2 liters/minute before saturation held at 97. 1-9-2021:  9am took benedryl and prednisone doses.  10am both nostrils still feel &#34;swollen,&#34; legs are weak and very tired (benedryl?).  Oxygen saturation is good - 97.  Starting to feel slight sensitivity at injection site.  4pm able to shower and move around.  Breathing is better.  Elected not to take benedryl as I&#39;m not getting an positive response from it, only fatigue.  Nostrils still feel swollen - tried lubricated nasal spray, not much help. 1-10-2021:  8:30 prednisone dose  Oxygen saturation good - 98% pulse 72.  Nostrils still feel swollen.  Injected site sore,  Started around 4pm (similar to shingles vaccine - expected).

                                                A couple of days after the injection I had  a rash below the area of the shot. The rash was 4 inches by 2.5 inches and itches. Now at day 12 I still have a faint rash with itching.  I also had a fever (100.1) and body aches for the first 2 days. Then later began coughing and still have the cough. I am not sure if the cough is related to the vaccine or if it may be a virus that I may have picked up. I have been treating the symptoms using OTC cough syrup, Tesslon Pearls and albuterol inhaler if I get wheezy.

Second dose, severe pain in arm, headache, back ache (lower, in proximity of kidneys), extreme tiredness, temperature over 99 degrees. This began approximately 18 hours after second dose. When the symptoms were at their worse, I went to bed and slept for over 4 hours. I felt better after I woke, however, the symptoms did not completely subside for an additional 6 hours.

                                                I feel issue is more related to injection error, Injection site was above the deltoid. I have had steroid injections in other shoulder and this is the sensation I felt during injection. The rn also told me &#34; You have tough skin&#34; after the intense pressure started. I worked the night before injection. I went home to sleep. woke around 2pm with intense pain in my left arm, I could not shift position or move my arm. with out excruciating pain. I used heat, aleve,  tylenol &amp; biofreeze. By saturday,  i could easily move left arm from elbow down, but extremely limited from shoulder. today i have most of my range of motion, but still have dull ache and pain restrictions. This pain is in my shoulder, not my arm or deltoid. . On thursday, pain was constant, roaring throb 7/10  shoulder to shoulder blade, almost to spine in back and down to elbow , then 9/10 with any movement.   Today is ache 2/10 just in my shoulder, with 5/10 with some movement. I had to call into work 1/7. I am scheduled tonight. I am an ICU RN.

The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

                                                I had the vaccine on January 5 and I was fine the whole day.  For the next two days my arm was sore from my elbow to my shoulder.  the third day my whole upper right side was crippled were as my shoulder neck and arm was almost paralyzed and I couldn&#39;t really move without severe pain.  A few hours later, my legs felt like noodles like I would fall over; I ended up leaving work early that day incase I couldn&#39;t get home.  The next morning I went to work.  the pain moved to my left side, same areas and creeped around my left rib cage.  This has been going on since.  I had off January 11 and 12 for my weekend.  I haven&#39;t been back to work since January 13.  I have had severe pain in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage, elbow, and now my left wrist and at times, my left hand feels numb.  Also, the within the last 24-48 hours my breasts have been tender.  I&#39;ve been lethargic since yesterday and now my vision is blurry.  My nurse keeps telling me to rotate between ibuprofen and tylenol, it&#39;s not helping at all, I am extremely uncomfortable and in pain.  In fact, when I take the ibuprofen, it causes more pain.  I&#39;ve been trying to reach the on call doctor for pain medication and no one is calling me back.   The only relief I have is when i hold my arm above my head.  I am groggy and I am feeling emotional.   I&#39;ve missed a week of work and I&#39;m nervous about getting my second vaccine, but I will get it. Oh, and I&#39;m not sleeping well.

                                                8 days after injection, right arm started to get red, swollen and hot at injection site.  This spread around upper arm area through the day.  Overnight I experienced body aches and chills.  Those flu like symptoms lasted just under 24 hours.  The arm was still swollen and red and hot for the next two days.  All those symptoms decreased.  The swelling and hotness disappeared completely.  The arm is still red in some areas and it is itchy sometimes.  Today one week after the delayed reaction, my arm still has red areas and its very itchy today.

It has continued through today (the swelling is about 4 inches by 3 inches, over my left deltoid). i just took Benadryl. i am now on day 9 post vaccination.

                                                Starting on Day 9 post injection I awoke with severe flu like symptoms:  severe headache, body aches, joint aches, fatigue, inability to get out of bed. Once I did get up I noted a severe red rash covering chest and extending up anterior neck (looked like a radiation burn). Symptoms lasted all day and made work or ADLs impossible. Felt about 75% better next day then symptoms returned the following day. Rash began peeling and appeared to look like a 2nd degree burn. Symptoms resolved by Day 4.

                                                Within a few minutes of injection had tingling sensation in tongue, followed by a couple days of increased stomach gas, tons of burping, some reflux, took Prevacid. Tongue seemed to affected during the first several days, especially along the sides, red. Didn&#39;t get concerned at first.  The common sore arm, cleared up within a few days. On about day 10 noticed large area on arm where injection given, warm red area about 4 inches by 3 inches, itchy, resolved on own by day 14 or 15.  The next week (third week) mouth seemed to be getting more sore, swallowing harder, took prevacid. Today, day 27, mouth is sore, especially noticeable along sides where there are circle looking ulcerations where surface tissue seems to be missing. Very discouraged. Doubt I feel able to receive second dose which has been postponed, by myself, until day 30. Seeing primary doctor on day 30.

On  1/22/21 I went to a walk in clinic and was told to take Benadryl.  Currently it is still swollen, not so red with slight tenderness.

Continued, along with itching, for 2-3 days, then was mostly gone except a warmth and slight discoloration (pink, not red). Began to feel fatigue within the next week. Then, around 1/17 or 18, the heat, pain, itching, and redness returned, along with a painful swelling on the left side  bottom of my mouth, and on the left side bottom of my tongue.  I&#39;d been told someone I knew had pain as well, and was prescribed Benadryl, so I took the over-the-counter type as directed, and within the second dose (after 4 hours), the pain and swelling receded in my mouth and on my arm. Within a day, I had no more mouth pain, and the arm feels better, although it&#39;s still pink, itchy, and warm.

I developed a large erythemic swelling at the site of inoculation and a rash which is about 6 inches in length by 4 inches in width.

She states these symptoms ceased and than around day 7 she developed left arm injection site redness, swelling, and pain that radiated into her elbow. With ibuprofen and ice this seemed to alleviate the symptoms. The past 24 hours the redness and swelling surrounding injection site is back; deep aching  from shoulder into her elbow. The swelling is very localized.

                                                About 3 PM she received her second vaccination for Covid.  She states that she has a history of adverse reactions to flu vaccines that are anaphylactic like in the past.  She usually premedicates with Benadryl and steroids.  Today she did take 100 mg of Benadryl prior to her vaccination.  Shortly after receiving the vaccine, she did feel like her throat was getting a little bit tight but she did not feel like it was true anaphylaxis.  However she then felt very off.  After this vaccine her throat started to feel tight, and she stated she did not feel well overall.  She did have some tunnel vision and was shaky. At about 1730 her heart rate drops to the 30s, she started feeling itchy, and then she went into a coughing fit and started to feel her throat close. She received 0.3 mg IM epinephrine, 20 mg IV famotidine, 125 mg IV methylprednisone, 0.5 mL of nebulized racepinephrine, and 500 mL NS bolus. She has since recovered and is stable on room air.

                                                Five days following the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed diffuse body pain, beginning in the right shoulder (for which she received a steroid injection), but then spreading to the entire body. This pain became so severe that she presented to the hospital via EMS, and was found to have a platelet count of 41 (9 days following the vaccine). No baseline platelet count is available prior to the vaccine (most recent was from 2019). Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is being considered, and the patient has been placed on IVIG and steroids. It is now 4 days into the patient&#39;s admission, and platelets continue to fall (currently 26). Hemoglobin appears normal at the time and there is no sign of active bleeding. Of note, the patient also has positive blood cultures, so thrombocytopenia as a result of sepsis is also a possibility.

                                                30 min after the injection I developed arm pain and a headache. Over the next 36 hours I developed a migraine, extreme body aches and severe arm pain. This was distinctly different arm and body pain compared to the first dose. I now understand the intractable headache after the first dose was a migraine. It was a horrible experience!!!!!!!. I laid down with ice on my body and finally took Tylenol after 24 hours. I was not able to get out of bed without pain; my life ceased for the duration. It was as it an alarm was set because ~ 6:00 a.m. Monday the 15th I woke up afraid to move only to learn that my body has reset and the pain was gone. I had returned to myself with only residual right arm pain.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

                                                Immediately after the injection - fever within 24 hours, chills, achy, fatigue. Fever for 4 day and  fatigue and achy/joint pain lasted for at least a couple weeks.  On February 11/12, 2021 started with double vision, progressively getting worse and constant starting on 2/17.  Sought medical treatment on 2/18 with emergent MRI ordered and completed on 2/18.  MRI results showed swelling/inflammation in the brain, specifically on the left side.  Treatment thus far has been antiviral medication, seeing specialists - Ophthalmologist and Neurologist on 2/24 and 2/25 respectively. Further treatment is ongoing but will include ongoing lab work, IVIG infusions starting 3/1 for 3 consecutive days, repeat MRI, potential LP and Quarantine for a minimum of 30 days following the first IVIG treatment.  Neurologist diagnosis is ADEM at this time.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful.

I took my temperature and headed to bed to rest, feel asleep and work up for another call and felt like my fever had broken with a sweat feeling. I felt much better and finished my night on call and home on holiday at 1 pm.

They gave me water and crackers and said try to eat something for second shot. After 30 mins I felt OK to leave. During the rest of the day I had a headache which worsen and next day (1/6/) the same and had that weird out of body sensation off and on. I also had mild achy feeling, fatigue and both hips and shoulders mild pain. I did take this day off from work. These symptoms resolved towards the end of that night. Doing much better today (1/8/21). I aslo had mild swelling and sore at the injection site which I expected like a flu shot. I have not had any reaction to any vaccination prior years.

                                                started with metallic taste in mouth, progressed rapidly to clammy, light headed, elevated BP and HR. All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

Husband came in and grabbed her, to get her back into bed. she could not stand. Went to ER at  Hospital. Had CT scan, blood work , EKG, chest xray. Was still kind of out of it but was able to communicate with nurses. Face is still black and blue. Last night got up at 4:00 a.m. something was wrong with her throat. Felt like a walnut was in her throat. Went to doctor this morning. They said it was a reaction from the shot. Got an EpiPen, prednisone. Call them in 2 days to let them know how she&#39;s doing and also wear a heart monitor because they do not know how to take care of her, Has had vision blurriness in both eyes. Has not felt well at all.

Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

It was difficult to take deep breath?s. It felt like I had pulled a muscle there. Moving positions from sitting to standing or raising my right arm to scratch or reach for something caused the muscle pain to occur. After taking ibuprofen, water and rest the pain subsided a lot, but still continues. There was no increase in my temperature.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  At about 9pm on 1/11/21 (i.e. approximately 5 hours after I received the vaccine), my left shoulder started to hurt.  When I woke up the next morning it was even more sore.  It wasn&#39;t bad when my arm was at my side, but it increasingly hurt as I rotated my arm upwards.   I would describe it as about twice as sore as I&#39;ve experienced in the past after a flu vaccine.   This continued that entire day (1/12/21).  By the next morning (1/13/21), the pain was starting to subside and by 9pm that night, it was gone.  As the pain level was relatively minor (approx. 3/10), I didn&#39;t treat it with anything.

                                                On 1.7.21 my arm began to hurt by that evening my arm began to swell.  On 1.8.21 it had swollen significantly and had extreme pain. About day six it started to feel a bit better.  A week and a half later it still had a large hard knot at the injection site by 1.16.21 it started to itch. On 1.17.21 it began to itch really bad and swell  and get hard again, that evening I used topical Benadryl and hydrocortisone which made the itch dissipate slightly.   On 1.20. the swelling is noticeable from six feet away and can be seen popping up under my shirt sleeve.  I made an appointment with a doctor for 1.21.21.

                                                About 14 hours after injection I awoke suddenly with severe joint pain in both knees, (8 on pain scale of 1-10) muscle aches in quadriceps and calves, as well as chills. Had a fever of 101 degrees.  As the hours passed, the joint pain spread to both hips  and ankles. Alternated Motrin and Tylenol with fever reduced to 100 degrees. All muscle aches, joint pain and chills continued for the next 2 days. Finally by day 3 the fever was down to 99.  Experienced fatigue, followed by severe vertigo by day 3.  Although muscle aches and joint pain slowly decreased over time, the vertigo has persisted and at times is accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

She was risk stratified into the high risk (30 minute obsevation) category based on a previous anaphylactic response to shelffish requiring epinhephrine. She reported only a minor pruritis after the first dose of the vaccine. While in the observation area she reported auditory exclusion to her male partner, then reportedly went unconcsious immediately.  Employees working in the observation area were notified and summoned medical assistance. A medical provider (PA) arrived and found the pt supine in the passenger seat and unresponsive. Her pulse was weak and thready. One dose of 0.3mg epi autoinjector was administered to her R lateral thigh at 12:03p

Was noticeable for 2 days. Felt a little lethargic that day but not ill. No fever or pain. Did not see rash listed as a reportable event on VAERS site but was advised to report rash anyway.

                                                I received my first vaccination on 12/28/2020, given very high in my right arm.  I noticed a tingling in my left arm within the first 15 minutes of the injection.  As I worked the rest of my evening shift, the tingling continued.  The next morning, my left arm was numb from the shoulder to the fingertips.  I could move my fingers and arm, but could not feel pain, hot or cold.  I called the employee health nurse, who told me that most symptoms resolve in 24 hours.  I took a day off and rested the arm.  The feeling came back gradually in the afternoon.  However, my hand was numb the following two mornings.  The symptoms resolved in 72 hours.

                                                On  January 16, the day after being vaccinated (1/15/21),  I woke up with my arms, hands, legs and feet tingling and numb all over and it lasted on and off all day January 16 and on and off all day January 17 and has persisted every day until Monday, January 26 when the symptoms became worse. Instead of tingling in all extremities (with some numbness)  the sensations changed to a pins and needles sensation with burning and random electrical shock sensations. I want to note that, yes, I have radiculopathies  - however, I have never had them change so suddenly and increase in intensity so fast. Also, the pins and needles sensation with burning and random electrical shocks are brand new symptoms for me (my radiculopathies have not presented this way before).  I reported these symptoms to my primary care provider today (1/29/21) and she instructed me to report my symptoms to VAERS and she is referring me to neurology. Note: I received my vaccination outside of my health care system and received it through the county because I could get the vaccination sooner that way.  I did not report these symptoms sooner because they were not listed as a possible adverse effect of getting the COVID19 Moderna  vaccination. However, as these symptoms have worsened over the past 2 weeks I have become concerned.  I have not added any OTC medications or supplements to the ones listed prior. I have gone to a chiropractor twice during this time for relief of my back pain with  no positive outcomes. Waiting to see the neurologist.

                                                Awakened by very painful left arm (7 on 1-10 scale), headache (3-4), general discomfort and restlessness.  Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

Increasing fatigue which maxed around 11am accompanied by  cold shivers and increased body temp . Fever picked at 5pm to 101.3F.  By 10pm fever and fatigue were gone! Day 2 after the vaccination: a red rash size 2 inch x 3 inch on the arm around the place of the injection, pain in the arm was nearly gone, no fever, no fatigue. Day 3 after the vaccination: red rash is gone. Back to normal.

On March 19, 2021 she was on the floor laying beside of the bed and my father noticed blood looking stuff on her shirt and bed covers. She was really confused and lethargic. She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

                                                Sore arm beginning in the evening which got progressively worse for a couple of days then subsided completely.  Some heart fluttering and some slight shortness of breath beginning a couple of days after.  More a nuisance.  No other symptoms I&#39;m aware of although every little thing I feel now I think may or may not be a symptom like slight head throb but not consistent pain.  Not sure because of vaccine.

                                                Started with body aches and lethargy at about 1800, then progressed to temperature sensitivity-felt cold. I went to bed but awoke hot, then alternated with cold frequently. I began having twitching in my hands which kept me awake.  These symptoms continued until morning. Toward the AM, about 0500, I had fluttering sensations in my body.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

I took Tylenol and Ibuprofen all night and all day and could not get relief.  I missed a day of work because of this. I am still with fever as of 5:55 pm and the body aches and migraine. This was not explained to me. I feel like I did when I had Corona on the worst days. I am really praying that this ends so that I can go back to work tomorrow.   I thought that someone was supposed to call and check on us each day....

The soreness lasted only one day and then no other symptoms until day 8.  On day 8, the injection site was red, itchy and raised.  Then yesterday, day 9 my are was tender to touch, VERY RED and HOT and expanding all over my arm, now in the back of my arm.  All the time remaining afebrile.  V-safe will only check in with me once a week from day 7, for 5 weeks, I am told so I wanted to report this.  I am waiting for a call from my PCP.  She is considering cellulitis, that is how red and hot it is but it is only tender, not hurting or requiring any pain medication.  I have good range of motion, too.

They continued like this but with fluctuating severity.  My calves and shin muscles began to be sore.  I sought out acupuncture and myofascia release work to help.  It did help temporarily.  I started to have left ankle pain, not like a sprain, like tendonitis or inflammation.  It continued to hurt to walk and the muscles more painful.  I started having darker urine about 4 days after the vaccine.  I drank cranberry juice and took a kidney/bladder supplement, increased fluids, but it continued dark.  I went to the Urgent Care on January 7th c/o muscle pain and dark urine.  My blood pressure was elevated, 179/100..unusual for me, and my urine was neg so it was sent for culture and blood was drawn for CBC and metabollic panel and Creatine Kinase

                                                Upon awakening the morning after the vaccination, I experienced swelling in my ankles, feet and fingers I also experienced swelling in my face where I had received filler injections six months ago. I also experienced feeling very spacey and foggy in addition to ringing in my ears, pins and needles all over my skin as well as a burning sensation on my upper back, buttocks and thighs.  Finally,  I felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.  I had no fever or headache but had soreness at the injection site.  I dosed with  600 mg of ibuprofen b.i.d. the first day as well as 50 mg of Benadryl at bedtime.  While I got some relief from these medications,  I still remain symptomatic on day two after receiving the vaccination.

Then progressed to whole body itching. Unable to sleep for two nights. Went to urgent care next morning. Was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg. Itching went away that night and was able to sleep. Next day bilateral hands had numbness and tingling and general dizziness so stopped taking hydroxyzine. Went to family practitioner and was prescribed methylprednisolone dose pack. After starting steroids, by 2nd day (today - 1-21-21), hands continued n/t. Bilateral feet developed n/t. Dizziness continues when standing but goes away when sitting. Balance and gait are unsteady. Difficulty walking from weakness, balance issues, and dizziness.

On day 8 after the vaccine my arm became red with an area the size of a silver dollar , below the injection site. My lymph nodes under my arm were swollen and sore and also lymph nodes above my clavicle on the right. I still feel fatigued and I have a full feeling around the area of my right upper abdomen ( liver), I dont have a gallbladder. Otherwise, I am OK. Just wondering about the 2nd dose. Lymph node still slightly swollen above clavicle.

BUT one week after that injection (Friday 1/22) I noticed my arm getting very sore, swollen and hot in the same injection site and several inches below?about the size of my palm. It continued to get more swollen and hotter for a couple of days, then a mild red rash appeared covering the whole affected skin surface by Sunday 1/24  &amp; then it all had slowly, basically, disappeared by Wed 1/27 night.

Finally went to Med-One walk-in-clinic on Saturday, January 30th (only one nearby with rapid response) and got and rapid response test for both COVID and the FLU.  Results were negative.  The APRN, at the clinic, asked me to report these symptoms to you.  I have no other health issues that could have caused this abnormality, as I am normally quite healthy.

On 01-30-2021, I felt very lethargic, I had headaches, and my fever spiked up to 100.8F and was drenched in sweat. I took Tylenol for the pain and body aches. On 01-31-2021, I started to feel a bit better and was little tired. I continued with left arm soreness at a pain level of 2.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 22 Dec 2020, about 4pm, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #011J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 22 Dec 2020, around 7pm, the patient experienced severe leg cramps.    On 23 Dec 2020, she experienced severe diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, shaking chills and bloody diarrhea. Treatment for nausea was ondansetron.    On 24 Dec 2020, the patient experienced terrible hemorrhoid pain and abdominal pain. On 25 Dec 2020, the patient went to the emergency room where she received a computed tomography scan. The computed tomography scan of  the lower abdomen showed that earlier diagnosis of diverticulitis 27 Nov 2020 &#34;inflammation&#34; had gotten better.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not reported.  The outcome for events, severe leg cramps, severe diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, shaking chills, bloody diarrhea and hemorrhoid pain, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62-year-old female patient with medical history of diverticulitis, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 011J20A), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of bloody diarrhea, the non-serious listed events of nausea and chills, and the non-serious unlisted events of severe leg cramps, severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hemorrhoid pain.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s history of diverticulitis is noted.

                                                My right arm was painful at the injection site for 3 days after the vaccination.  Then on Wednesday, February 3, 2021 about 3:45pm I experienced shortness of breath and some chest discomfort.  At approximately 6:00pm, I felt a strong pulsating at my left temple which continued through the night.  I took my blood pressure and it was 150/90 and pulse was 103 which is the highest reading I have ever had because I am on blood pressure medication.  I took 2 aspirin, my Proventil Inhaler, and another Losartan 50 mg even though I had already taken my daily dose in the morning.  I rested and continued to monitor my vitals.  At about 11:30pm, I took my blood pressure and it was 160/110 and pulse was 109.  I then took 2 more aspirin and my Clonazapem and fell asleep.  In the morning on February 4, 2021, I tried to get in to see my doctor, but she advised to go to the emergency room.  I went to an Urgent Care facility and the checked me and did an EKG and that was normal.  But they also advised me to go to the emergency room.  So I did go and they did another EKG, chest x-ray, and several blood tests.  They came back normal but they wanted me to stay overnight for observation.  On February 5, 2021 they did an echocardiogram and a stress test, which were normal.  I was released from the hospital that afternoon.  I have a follow up appointment with my Primary Care Physician on February 12, 2021.  My blood pressure and pulse continue to be a little higher than normal.  At this point, the pulsating, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort have improved.  On Saturday, February 6, 2021, I noticed felt itchiness, redness and swelling at the injection site on my right arm.  It is still itchy, red and swollen as of February 8, 2021.  I am putting hydrocortisone cream on it.

Then 7 days after the vaccine my injection site became very swollen, red, very hard in the injection area and itchy.  I also felt slightly achy and had a headache for 3 days before that. Now 2 days later the reddened area is larger and circular like a target. Skin is warm to the touch and itchy.  I?m no longer achy and no more headaches.  The swelling in the left arm has decreased slightly but the redness is bigger.

                                                I developed chills/shivering in the evening of the vaccination (2/19/21) but was not alarmed, just tried to stay warm.  I ate normally.   I awakened in the night with extreme chills and was shaking most of the night, unable to get warm.  I felt feverish and had body aches as well as nausea.  I threw up what I could to alleviate the feeling of nausea, about 2 a.m.   I slept restlessly until 9:00 am, then tried to take a hot shower.  Though the chills were gone, I felt weak and listless and went back to bed shortly after showering.  I slept for about 4 hours.  I had little/no appetite for most of the day after the vaccine.  By the second day I still had a headache but felt better, albeit weak.   I took Ibuprofen for the body/headaches with minimal success.

Tylenol did little to decrease this fever, motrin seemed to bring it down for about and hour then would go back up again. Temp stayed between 102 to 103 through Sunday 2/21/21. Temp 99-101 on Monday 2/22/21. Today as I report, temp is 99 and continue to feel very fatigued with no energy and poor appetite.

Had to sit down for a long time, couldn&#39;t really open my eyes. Bad head feeling. Eyes hurt, but were not swollen. No swelling, just that constant metallic overwhelming. Dizzy. Stayed at pharmacy for about 40 minutes. On drive home, hot face, metallic infusion, very warm. Fever at home,  achy all over, 99.8, very dizzy, brain fog, very weak, arm sore. Next morning, no better. Took a Nexium and immediately big hive popped up on my chest. Disappeared about an hour later. Took 3 days to feel like myself. Still concerned about allergic reaction. I&#39;m a little itchy, tingly. I&#39;m now terrified of getting that second shot.

I&#39;m pretty stubborn, and have continued to work despite sxs.  I missed last Friday 2/19 because the pain was so severe.

She denied recently starting any new medications/supplements, or recent change in her levothyroxine dose. There were no headaches, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, recent infectious illness or sick contacts. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto?s Disease over 10 years prior and had been on the same dose for more than 2 years.   VS were stable and within normal limits, physical exam was only remarkable for weakness on 4 extremities 4/5, lethargy, bradylalia, bilateral ptosis, no focal neurologic deficits, sensation intact. Laboratory workup revealed normal Hb 14.8, normal renal and kidney function, normal cortisol level, TSH normal 3.7, normal FT4: 1.2, normal CPK, negative tox screen. ESR and CRP were performed, and both were found to be elevated ESR 74, CRP 28, at that moment we decided to do immunologic workup showing high titers of ANA &gt;1:320 with a nuclear speckled pattern, and a positive rheumatoid factor 60. At this point a full rheumatologic panel was performed which was negative for anti-Ach receptor Abs, negative anti-CCP, anti- dsDNA, anti-smith, negative anti-Jo1, anti-RNP, negative anti-TPO, negative anti-SCL70, normal C4 and C3 however elevated total CH50 &gt; 60, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Her symptoms of severe fatigue persisted throughout her admission and it was decided to give her a course of prednisone 40mg for 5 days and follow up as outpatient with a Rheumatologist. Repeat workup 2 weeks after discharge showed still elevated ESR at 72, high CRP 17, rheum factor elevated again at 67.  At this point no clear cause was identified as she did not have any symptoms of Sjogren or anything else other than severe persisting fatigue.  Another course of steroids was given and 1 month later she stated that she was much improved and was able to go back to work. Stated that she would not take her second covid MODERNA vaccine dose due to fear of recurrence of symptoms. It appeared that this vaccine triggered a severe inflammatory and autoimmune reaction in this patient with history of Hashimoto?s disease. The association between MODERNA vaccine and development of autoimmunity and inflammatory reaction needs to be assessed.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No concomitant product use was reported.  On an unknown date the patient received her first dose of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) via unknown route at unknown anatomical location for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 24-Feb-2021, the patient received her second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly at unknown anatomical location for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 24-Feb-2021, the patient experienced severe pain in a few hours and was taken to the emergency room, then, discharged. The patient was taken back to the emergency room on 25-Feb-2021 (Thursday night), and on 26-Feb-2021 (Friday), she was paralyzed from the waist down, losing use of both arms. The patient was tested at the hospital for transverse myelitis, which was negative. Spinal tap for GBS (Guillan Barre Syndrome) was protein positive and she was given a definitive diagnosis of GBS. There was movement in fingers but could not pick up objects.     Seriousness criteria for the events of Gullian-Barre Syndrome and paralyzed from the waist down, lost use of both arms was medically significant.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to events was not applicable.  The outcome of all the events was unknown.  No further information was provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Death was pronounced a short time later.  Per her treating physician who signed the death certificate, the cause of death is felt to be probable myocardial infarction due to electrolyte abnormalities due to complications of her diabetes mellitus.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

                                                Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021 I felt a little strange.  Just not myself. A little dizzy.  Went to work overnight.  Got up at 5 am Friday, Jan 8, 2021.  Still felt odd.  Dizzy. Had to think before I did anything. I stood up from the bed and sat back down again as if I was dizzy and confused.  Drove myself home from work, fed the cats and went right to bed.  I felt very fatigued, had developed a monster headache.  Was dizzy, had chills, body aches, nausea.  I brought  water bottle over to the bed with me but after laying down just could not get myself up to get a drink.  Felt very fatigued.   Slept until 2 pm.  Took my temperature.  It was 101.5.  Had no energy, ate no food, took no meds, just went back to sleep.  Still nauseous, had headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Woke up at 5:00 pm to feed cats.  That?s all I did, and go to the bathroom.  Took my temperature again.  It was 100.9.  Still felt awful:  nauseous, headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Seemed like I could  not get warm.  Stayed in bed and slept.  Saturday, Jan.  9, 2021 I woke up around 7:30 to go to the bathroom.  I fed the cats also.  Still dizzy, moving slow.  My headache was gone, but still felt unsteady.  After feeding the cats,  I went back to bed.  Slept until 12:30 that afternoon.

Within 2 hours, I could not continue to work and went home. Took motrin at home and rested.  The following morning  the headache was mild but the injection site was very painful. No reddness or swelling, not firm but extremely tender to touch. Pain at injection site was present for 2 days then resolved slowly..

                                                After injection there was a large knot at the injection site and was very sore for a couple of days. Two weeks after vaccine I had an appointment with my dermatologist. She noticed there was still a large red area around the injection site. It is no longer tender and does not itch however she felt I should report it. As of today the large red area is still there.

                                                Approx. 12:30am I awoke to a leg cramp. I arose from bed and stood up till the cramping muscle relaxed.  Then I walked to the restroom and during the short distance,I felt a sudden &#34;flush&#34;.  Upon entering restroom, I felt I was getting faint.  Feeling that I was about ready to faint, I tried to easily lower myself to the floor without striking my head or body.  Feeling very dizzy and faint, my stomach instantly felt nauseous and then vomited.  After vomiting, I  suddenly started to &#34;shake very violently&#34; (chills?).  The shaking was uncontrollable and went on for approx. 10 -15 min.  I tried to relieve the violent shaking by covering up with bath towels, that I was able to reach from the floor, where I was still sitting; but that did not seem to help.  After I did not feel so faint, I called for help to have my husband help me back into bed to try to warm up.  By that time the shaking (chills) were no longer so severe, and I was gradually able to fall back to sleep with no further problems the remainder of the night.  The following morning, and ever since that night, I have had no other adverse reactions.   For many years, I have received the yearly flu vaccine and have never had any kind of reaction, accept some minor soreness at the injection site (muscle).

                                                About 14 hours after vaccination, I had a (really bad) pulsating headache in a band around my head, body aches (hip flexors, shoulders, back, neck), chills, fever/sweats, and nausea/vomiting (threw up twice, total, about an hour or two apart after not eating for 10 hours - small amount of liquid came up). The nausea/vomiting went away about 4 hours after onset while the other symptoms remained for an additional 42 hours. I also had sinus/eye pressure that began about 22 hours after vaccination and ended with the other symptoms. Could not sleep for the duration because of headache. Very tired/sleepy about 62 hours after injection and was able to nap since headache went away. I still have soreness at injection site about 72 hours after injection.  I would say the worst part of this was the headache because it was so bad, I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything while I had it - I had read that NSAIDs might reduce the uptake of the vaccine so didn&#39;t want to take any. Therefore, there was no way to get rid of the headache and it was very unpleasant for almost 3 days. The next worst was the nausea/vomiting, because, well, nausea/vomiting, and especially because there was nothing to bring up. And, unlike vomiting from bad food or something, you don&#39;t really feel better afterward, just still nauseated. The other symptoms were more bearable. Did not call or see doctor because I had read about these possible side effects and didn&#39;t think there was anything the doctor could do to alleviate them.

However 13th day after receiving injection  I developed severe fatigue, fevers as high as 101.9, shaking, nausea, severe itching.  overall feeling of sick.  3 days later it passed. Due to my preexisting conditions I have isolated myself for almost 1 year, followed all protocols, and very rarely out in public. I also recieved flu vaccine.  So doubt the symptoms I had could be contributed to flu bug. So since it seemed very odd I am reporting this to CDC. Note: I had 2nd dose 02/19/21. So far only reaction is sore injection site. Should I develop symptoms after several days like the ones I reported after 1st dose, I will report these to this site.

                                                At 11am on 2/16, my arm began to get sore.  I took Advil at 4pm and it wasn&#39;t so bad.  At about 10pm when I went to bed, I had issues falling asleep because my heart felt like it was pounding through my chest.   That pounding came off and on during the next day.  I woke up twice and my feet were ice cold and my body was very hot.  The second time I woke I thought I would take some tylenol and was extremely dizzy walking to the bathroom.  I was so weak I couldn&#39;t open the bottle.  I slept nine hours, very unusual.  I felt very under the weather all day until around 5pm.  I woke up the next morning feeling pretty normal.  The arm pain was completely gone by the 18th.

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

I sat down to tie my shoe and noted Pitting &#43; 3 or 4 edema to BIL Calves.  Redness , warmth in a few areas.  R leg 1&#34; larger than L.  Then  I mentioned it to another nurse and  she said it could be side affect of Norvasc.  I spoke with my PA about it on 2/12 she D&#39;C&#39;d Norvasc and perscribed  Nefidepine 30 mg ER. I have not taken it yet I am monitoring my BP and it is WNL.   The edema less in calves however continues in ankles.  I have gotten MULTIPLE broken capillaries all over my legs.          Long short it has to be a reaction to vaccine.  And it continues almost 2 months after injection.   I can&#39;t wear most of my socks.  It is BAD.

Hip to below knew, dull and numbish; from below knee thru toes, same tingling as fingers. Biggest concern was side of face and jaw; dull and numbish. All these reactions occurred on right side of body. Thursday late afternoon, the tingling and the dull and numbish diminishes but the arm aching along with inability to completely raise remains. Friday; arm remains the same Saturday; arm below injection site now feels only bruised NOTE: while I enjoy a strong immune system, by body is very sensitive to new medicines/tweaking medicines. Also applies to food.  APPROX 25 years ago, I believe I contracted Gullian Barre, where the immune system attacks nervous system. There was./is no test to confirm although I continue to endure some side effects. QUESTION- with all said is it advisable to receive the 2nd vaccine shot?   Please advise ASAP

Following day (appx 24 hours) following administration, patient was having fever and unresponsive.  Patient also had local, large, hard hematoma at injection site.  It is worth noting that the patient had recently completed CDC recommended isolation protocol, and was symptom free at time of administration - determining they were qualified to get vaccine.  The facility is also aware that the patient&#39;s present condition could be related to an active COVID 19 infection / relapse.

I was taken to a room and had vitals and was hypertensive and tachycardic with a worsening headache, I was given 50 mg Benadryl and put ice on my face and neck for about 20 minutes as I felt I was burning up. I remained at the clinic for an hour for monitoring. I never had difficulty breathing , and it was mostly resolved in about 45 minutes except for the mild headache and my face was still red and my eyes were swollen for at least an hour.

I spoke to the nurse who hooked me up to bp machine. O2 sat was fine at 98. BP was 158/110, pulse rate was 157. Normal values for me are bp 120/70, pulse 80. BP started to go down and several minutes later another flush happened and bp and pulse rate went back up. Dropped again then third flush with increased bp and pulse happened. After this vitals went back to normal and didn&#39;t happen again. I subsequently developed a pounding headache which lasted until the next morning. Arm was sore as expected. BP that night was normal and the next morning normal. No further adverse effects noted other than fatigue.

                                                I had soreness in the left arm for @ 2 days after the vaccination.  No redness, no swelling.   After that, no known problem.  Exactly one week after the injection, On the morning of Tuesday, January 5, 2021, I noticed soreness in my left arm similar to what I had right after the injection. It was painful to extend my arm over my head.  Later that day, I noticed a small 1 3/4&#34; x 1&#34; area of redness and warmth appearing at or right next to the area of the injection.  Over the next 24-48 hours, the area grew and became swollen, more red, and warmer.  The soreness in my arm didn&#39;t seem to change at all; it was painful to lift my arm overhead and to touch.  The area grew to approximately 3&#34; x 4&#34; during that time period.  On Thursday morning, 1/7/21, my PCP, inspected the area and felt the swelling and the warmth.  She believed that I had likely developed cellulitis in the arm and placed me on cephalexin 500 mg, one capsule tid.  I began taking that on Thursday afternoon, 1/7/21.   By Friday evening, the area was barely visible, but was still warm and a little swollen.  It was still slightly tender. Today, Saturday, 1/9/21, the area is still a little warm and slightly swollen, but not visible at all, and there is only tenderness if I press on the area.

                                                Initially after getting the vaccine I had mild to moderate soreness in my arm for about 1-2 days which then subsided.  Then on Jan.7 I began to have itching at the injection site and a 3x4 inch area of redness.  I applied some OTC 1% hydrocortisone cream which did lessen the itching but redness persisted.  Today, Jan.10 the redness measures approximately 3 1/2 x 4 1/2 inches, itching is present at times and area is warm to the touch.  I have no fever and arm feels only slightly tender right where needle was inserted.

After 24 hours, my right eye lid started to catch when I started to blink. I call it lid lag. It has persisted longer than 24 hours.  My eye lid does not blink the same as my left eye. It&#39;s like a brief before it returns to my regular eye lid. There has been no worsening,  and no improvement, it has remained the same.

It lasted overnight and into the following day until approximately 3pm when I was able to get out of bed and drink water.

Light adverse side effects right after the vaccine was administered. Remained under supervision for 45 minutes longer instead of 15 min. Within 5 mins, heat rose up to my head causing dizziness &amp; head spin. Then loss of smell lasting for 10 min or a bit longer, then tongue tied hard / swollen for 3 hrs and lasting mildly 1 day after. Severe dehydration. Did not monitor heart beat due to severe fatigue. Took blood pressure rising and falling like roller coaster 2x. I stop and learned to relax and sleep throughout the day to calm the nervous system and the slight fever. Other normal aching pains as pre-described side effects. No nausea, vomiting, no rash as of 1 day after and no difficult breathing. Occasional and short loss of smell carried after 1st day.

Severe headache, body aches, chills, fever, exhaustion and diarrhea, Slight chills and arm soreness at bedtime the evening of vaccine. Woke up the next morning after vaccine in complete body pain. Diarrhea began later in day. Exactly like my COVID experience! Slept all day except to take Tylenol and Imodium.  Woke second day after vaccine feeling improvement but still tired and weak. On couch most of day. Today, 3rd day after vaccine,  much improved but still not 100%.  Will never get the 2nd dose! Have heard it is usually worse and I would probably not be able to handle it

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At about 8 pm the day following my vaccination; I started to experience sharp needle-like pain at the site of injection (left arm).  It was brief.  Immediately following that pain, the fingers on my left hand went numb and I couldn&#39;t feel them -- particularly my pinky and ring fingers.  I could move my fingers but they were numb.  I did not have a fever. This lasted about 2 hours.  I iced the site of injection, kept my hand above my shoulder and massaged my fingers for the duration (about 2 hours).  When this first occurred my heart was racing -- but that might have been because it scared me.  I feel fine today.

                                                With 10 min of vaccination, Heaviness and numbness in arm, cool tingling going from top of both legs down to toes, warm rush and tingling starting at lower back and going up back and chest, nausea. The feeling in chest and back would last about 10 seconds, subside for a little while and then start again. This happened off and on for about an hour. The tingling in legs continued for about 2 hours. About 1 hour after I received vaccine I started having vision problems, blurriness, strange spots /lights , had trouble focusingnmyneyes. Then a terrible headache set in. I have had similar vision problems with a migraine headache in the past. Felt like it triggered a migraine. Vitals were normal. Checked out by EMS and went to local ER.

                                                After the vaccine on Jan 16, 2021, I had a sore arm with minor inflammation for 3 days.  This subsided without any over the counter medications.  Yesterday at about 5 pm, my arm started to itch slightly at the site of the shot.  Upon waking up this morning, my upper arm has a red circle and is inflamed and it hurts again.  I applied prescription cortisone and will continue to apply throughout the day.   The soreness seems about the same pain level as the first 3 days after receiving the shot.  There is no evidence of bug bite and it would be very strange if I got bit in the exact same location as the shot.

Approximately 12:30-1:00 AM on 01/09/2021 woke up, turned my head and experienced room spinning dizziness for about 2 minutes. Had to remain completely still to stop the room spinning.  For the next 2 days (until the morning of Monday 01/11/2021)  I experienced on and off room spinning dizziness at unpredictable intervals.  Usually didn&#39;t last longer than 2 minutes but had to remain completely still to stop the spinning.   Starting on Monday 01/11/2021 had &#34;normal&#34; dizziness along with some flu like symptoms,  headache, tiredness,  soreness/achiness and extreme soreness and pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine shot. I stayed out of work because of the on-going dizziness. These symptoms continued until Saturday 01/16/2021.  I took an antihistamine on Saturday night and finally woke up Sunday 01/17/2021 with no dizziness.

                                                -fever to 101 deg F; shaking chills; body aches; swelling and induration at the injection site.  Started about 24 hours after the shot.  Mostly resolved in about 14 hours.  I am a physician who runs an inpatient unit and virtually everyone who got the shot on my unit had the same symptoms - my APRN who is only 29 years old had a fever of 102 deg and had to stay home the day after his shot.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

I didnt have a fever but the chills went on for several hrs so I took 2 500mg tylenol and the chills ended around 5pm.  I developed a headache and still had to continue to drink plenty water because my mouth got that super dry feeling again.  I went home ate and relaxed until I fell asleep.  I had body aches and because my arm was hurting I couldnt lay on that side.  I took benedryl and tylenol before bed. Today I still feel very very tired, fatigued and my body still aches.  My arm is still really red, warm to the touch and has a nice knot at the injection site and the headache comes and goes.

Took tylenol before getting vaccine, and the next day around 4 in the morning started having malaise, pain, fever, chills. (fever around 102), and went 104 around midafternoon, and 106 around 10. Chills, pain, weakness. Next day I was feeling well. I started noticing small dots on knee and shoulder. And then I started noticing bruising on my hands and legs. Felt fine on Sunday. I started noticing the bruises were becoming more pronounced. On Monday when I woke up the bruises were worse, and I went to the ER. The doctor checked CBC and platelets count was low around 28 thousand and was admitted into the hospital and they treated me with solumedrol 100 mg. Platelets count went back up.

Was in so much pain that I took Oxycodone at 12:00 am, another at 3:00 am. TYLENOL with codeine at 5:00 am and another at 7 :00 am. Was not expecting so much pain. If I did not have the RXs, I would have to go to the emergency room. I still have pain and it goes down by arm. I have been told that the injection was given to high.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 039K20A) on 31 Dec 2020.  On 28 Jan 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 209K20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an undisclosed date the patient experienced injection site soreness, generalized body pain all over, chills, low grade fever and weakness.  She also went to the hospital because she had a platelet count of 28,000.   Treatment of these events was not provided.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events, platelet count of 28,000, generalized body pain all over, weakness, on and off chills, low grade fever, and vaccination site soreness, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I was awakened at 4;00 a.m. the next morning with a very stiff, sore, cramping arm.  I had the normal reactions: slight headache, low temp, itchy, swollen, hot red arm, but very stiff and sore. This lasted 3-4 days with the most noticeable reaction being the sore arm from shoulder to elbow.  On Feb 10, one week later, my arm started itching again in the afternoon and by evening was swollen, red, hot, and hurting  just like the first 3-4 days or slightly worse.  It gradually got better after 4-5 days, returning to normal by 2/20.  The only other symptom the second time were blisters on my left hand above my pointer finger and ring finger.  I&#39;m not sure if they were related or not since I walk outside or if I may have been exposed to poison ivy since the blisters looked similar.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA adverse event.   Approximately 7 hours after the 1st COVID vaccination on 2/22/2021, patient developed symptoms of fatigue, aches, chills &amp; fever. Her symptoms worsened into 2/23/21 with increasing shortness of breath. On arrival in the emergency center on 2/23/21,  she was hypoxic with  SpO2 81% on room air.  Oxygen supplement via nasal cannula was given which improved her oxygenation. Covid 19 test negative. Chest Xray shows pulmonary edema and CTA chest shows no PE.  She was admitted to the hospital and provided supportive care.   Pulmonary Edema and inflammatory process is likely associated with the vaccine. Patient appeared to be improving, however, on 2/26/21, she was working with Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy and had a pulse ox reading of 75% on room air. She was on 10 Liters of oxygen via nasal cannula by the time she make it back to bed and her pulse ox was 89%. Neurology exam shortly afterward the above event demonstrated an NIHSS of 21.  Patient became non-verbal and stat imaging revealed an acute hemorrhage in the left occipatal lobe likely representing a SAH.  Patient then transferred to another hospital that could provide neurosurgical intervention.

She said this lasted 5 minutes the first time and then it happened again when she laid down to go to sleep, lasting about 3 minutes. She noted these same symptoms last month approximately 2 weeks after her first covid vaccine. She was admitted for observation to the facility to rule out stroke/TIA and had negative tests across the board. Physician attributes symptoms to covid vaccine. Pt was discharged in stable condition.

It is my sense that I was improperly inoculated outside the deltoid muscle, hitting the axillary nerve. The symptoms came on almost immediately, though (since it&#39;s a while ago) I cannot be reliably sure of the time. The pharmacist injecting me was very scattered, in my opinion, and perhaps tired from a long day of immunization. My sense is that she failed to properly landmark my arm. I am a short-stature woman with good muscle tone, if that helps. I am seeking medical evaluation on 4/9 and, likely, will start physical therapy to regain range of motion, which is disabling.

                                                Injection was at 12:00 Pm on 12/29/2020. At 12:20 PM i started to feel faint, slightly nauseous . I layed down on my office floor, , my heart rate went up to 140 BPM and BP was around 140/76. My MA checked it . One of my physician colleague&#39;s that was nearby checked on me as well as the nurse that gave me the injections. it took about 30-40 minutes for the symptoms to subside. I was sent to our Urgent care dept in the same clinic by wheelchair at around 12:30-12:40 pm. I was evaluated and my symptoms subsided in 30-40 minutes. I was out of Urgent care at 1:25 pm, able to walk upstairs back to my office and felt okay and was seeing patients again at 1:30 PM.  This reaction was similar to getting a shot of Novocaine w/ epinephrine for a dental procedure I received a few years ago, so if I were to sum it up it was like getting a shot of epinephrine. it was not a vasovagal reaction as my BP was high. I have felt fine since. I plan to get the second vaccine. Any suggestions to avoid these symptoms w/ the second one would be appreciated.

                                                Started approx 80 minutes after injection with soft palate swelling and throat fullness, followed by change in voice, and chest tightness with paresthesias. Went directly to ED. Sats  were good, no wheeze, throat swelling was noted. BP initially 150/93, peaked at 189/93,. Was 148/67 at discharge. Received oral Benadryl and Zyrtec, IV dexamethasone and Pepcid. ECG was done, no other labs. Observed for approx 90 minutes with improvement of all symptoms. Did need to take additional Benadryl dose approx 5 hours after first dose for return of mild throat fullness and rising BP. Both resolved within 30 minutes of dose. No further throat symptoms, BP fluctuations for over 24 hours now

When I woke to get a shower around 5:30 am on 1/6/2021, I was extremely lightheaded and laid down on the bathroom floor to keep from passing out and falling. The lightheadedness did not improve and my husband was able to help me back to bed. I was unable to overcome the chills and lightheadedness even with lying down, until about 10 am. I am able to sit up but still some what lightheaded and chills are beginning to fade. I do not feel I would be able to walk more than a few feet or drive at this time due to ongoing symptoms.

                                                About five days after vaccine administration I noticed an inflammation of the area of the achilles tendon of left foot. Since I am not prone to inflammation of any sort nor did I have any strain or trauma, I took notice. I do not CHF (causing swelling of the ankles). The area of inflammation is tender, a bit red and a bit swollen. It is worrisome since I have never had anything like this in the past. I WILL NEED FOLLOW UP ON THIS. I AM UNSURE IF I SHOULD RECEIVE THE SECOND VACCINE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF SIMILAR INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES HAVE BEEN REPORTED, WHETHER IN ANKLE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE BODY.  I realize that this may not be a typical vaccine reaction BUT this is a brand new vaccine, has not been time-tested, is only permitted by the FDA to be administered under these emergency circumstances. SO all possible reactions must be taken seriously and recorded. We are the guinea pigs. Also. I was handed a packet of papers when I received the vaccine. To register for v-safe the only two options given for registration were smart phone browser or QR code. I do not have a cell phone. So this leaves me out of the loop, which I think is unfair and unwise. Why can computer registration not be made available, and if it can then why doesn&#39;t the instruction sheet tell of this? In rural areas not everyone has a cell phone nor is cell service available to all areas.

It took a couple of hours for it to come down to normal. Went to sleep and woke up BP normal and a slight headache.  My arm was sore lasting about 3 days.

                                                Arm soreness noted on Jan. 5. On Jan. 11 I was sneezing a lot with a runny nose. This last for 24 hrs. On the 12th I noticed a raised area in the injection site. I took an Advil .  On the 13th my arm started getting hard near the injection site with some redness. On that day I took a Benadryl once and Advil BID. Today the arm is very hard, red and is warm to the touch. My temp is 100.2. I took 80 mg ASA and a hour later took an Advil.  I reported all my Sx w/ Moderna. They recommended that I call my PMD for Tx. I contacted my PMD and the health department for treatment and they referred me to CDC. No treatment was suggested or given

The redness went down my arm to my inner elbow down my forearm to my wrist. The redness going down my arm was not as bad after I took the Allegra.  It was all extremely painful. I had to go see Dr. because the itching was so bad. Dr. prescribed medicine for the swelling/itching.  At times my throat was sore and my face was flushed and I had a tightness in my chest. But that did not last long.

Redness and tenderness went away after 3 days, however lump at injection site remained.  Redness and skin irritation suddenly appeared 2 weeks after injection along with slight chill sensation up and down arm.  Skin around injection site is very sensitive to touch.  I can see exactly where the injection was given 2 weeks ago as the needle entrance point is red.  I have applied Benadryl spray to the injection site and applied a bandage to prevent irritation from clothing rubbing site.

                                                I began to have fever and chills about 8 that night after I got home from work.  My fever and chills continued through the next day and night.  My highest temperature was102.3.  I also experienced fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and weakness and lightheadedness.  The fatigue, muscle aches, weakness/lightheadedness  is still there along with pain and swelling at the injection site.

Then, 7 days after the vax, started itching in the area of the injection site, which subsided with a Bendadryl overnight and next day.  In the evening of the 8th day after injection, began itching again and noticed large red patch, slightly swollen and a little warm.  Itching is mild, goes away with cortisone cream.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

I took some pain reliever and felt better about 24 hours after vaccine was administered. I did not go a doctor, as I felt much better the next day. This was at home and not at the facility.

Was 3 inches by two inches. The arm is now back to normal.  .2. Day 8.  Woke at roughly midnight with extreme heat and burning in all toes.  Quite painful.  Very unusual, as I have never experienced anything like this before.  When pain and burning became overwhelming I took Tylenol.  It helped and I was able to sleep.   The next morning the pain and burning were gone but my toes were, and continue to be quite numb, as is the area of my feet that surrounds my toes.  I can&#39;t fully feel my socks, shoes, sheets, etc.  It feel like I have cotton stuffed in my shoes.  It is hard for me to related the level of heat, burning and pain that happened.  I felt like I could melt a block of ice with my feet.  It was severe. I marked &#34;disability or permanent damage&#34; below because I don&#39;t know if the nerves in my feet will return to normal.

Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

Down the left side of back to center of back.  8 days later pain is still severe.   I have contacted VAERS (with no response), contacted CDC (no response) and revisited the vaccine clinic and they referred me to my primary doctor or ER.  Primary is not trained in covid=19 vaccine side effects.  Spent 6 hours in Emergency yesterday to no avail.  This is day 9 and I still have chronic nerve pain.

It only lasted a few minutes.   About after an hour of being home, I had an issue swallowing only once.   I don&#39;t know if adverse reaction, or panic attack.  I have my 2nd dose schedule for the beginning of Feb  I will let them know what happened.   Also, quarter size red spot on right arm.   It hurt when touched.   Lasted a couple days.

                                                Approximately 35 minutes post vaccine administration I noticed a tingling sensation in my left facial area from mycheek area to my temple.  Later the same evening the sensation included the area below my left cheek.  A few days later the affected area appeared to move closer to my nose. On 01/28/2021 I notified Dr office and was recommended to go to Urgent Care to be evaluated, which I did.  Urgent Care recommended I go to Emergency Department for a further evaluation, which I did.  I was given an EKG and a physical exam. Both were essentially normal and my final diagnosis was left facial numbness.

It was improving and for several days pain, itching and redness were gone.  A week after the injection I developed redness that has continued to spread down my arm with severe itching and pain where tissue is swelling, espcially just below my elbow.  Body aches especially in lower back area on right side at waist level  I was given Kevlex first, the vancomycin iintravenously in the ER, doxycylin at home, also taking benedryl at night.

                                                Initial normal redness and tenderness of injection site (about size of silver dollar) cleared after several days, but on evening of day 9 (1/25/21),  large round redness, with hardness and heat suddenly reappeared and expanded.  Given history of cellulitis, I consulted primary care physicians office and was seen 1/26/21.  Agreed to treat with antibiotic cephalexin if perimeter still expanding by morning of 1/17/21, which it was.  After 48 hours on antibiotic, looking much better, but itchy. Advised today to stop antibiotic as medical clinic has become aware of &#34;Covid Arm&#34; rash in USA Today article, and I was advised to report this event to VAERS.  Now suspecting this is delayed rash not cellulitis.  Will prep right arm for #2 vaccine on 2/13/21 with ChloraPrep and monitor.

I knew my mouth was hanging open and couldn&#39;t shut it. My husband took my blood pressure,  it was 61/50.  After a few minutes I was coming to, blood pressure began to come back up. My husband had called 911 when my blood pressure dropped so low.  By the time they arrived it was back up to normal.   I have never had any problems with blood pressure,  low or high. Or with dizziness,  fainting etc. I am very sure it was from the vaccine

                                                Patient had the first Moderna Covid vaccine on Thursday 1/21/2021.  She had a bit of sore arm on that day and the day after.  On Saturday 1/23/2021, she had a fever of 100.5 F (11AM), nausea, light headache and chills. The temperature went down after she took ibuprofen.  Patient&#39;s husband enrolled her to V-Safe to report all the adverse effects she experienced. On Sunday 1/24/2021, her temperature was 98.3F. She still had nausea and no appetite.  She and her husband watched a football game in their bedroom upstairs.  Husband noticed that his wife was pacing around the room many times. At 7Pm, Husband went downstairs for dinner but she refused to come down to eat. He went upstairs around 8pm, TV was still on. He turned off TV and went down stairs again thinking his wife felt as sleep while watching TV. He went back upstairs for bed around 10:30 PM. Husband said his wife had a deviated septum so she would snore very loudly when asleep.  He didn?t hear her snoring so he went to check on her and found her not responsive.  Husband called emergency services. Paramedic came at 10:45 and said patient was passed. Husband sent many texts to V-safe after that to report the incident. No response was received from V-safe. Patient?s doctor told her husband that she died due to cardiac arrest.

Did not call doctor because it was in the middle of the night and racing did stop.   Now, continue to feel weak and fatigued, 70 hours after shot.  Spoke to doctor&#39;s office this morning.  Advised me to keep hydrated and take Tylenol if needed.

This was  accompanied by a prickling sensations.  I got a sore inside my right nostril and a cold sore on right upper lip.  The mottling and vein prominence continue intermittently still.  Improving but not resolved entirely. Along with this, my eyes became intermittently  itchy as if I had an allergic irritation. This has also completely resolved.  I spoke with a relative who is a physician  and he felt that I may have had a hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis reaction.

This time had low grade fever (100.1), body aches, sore neck, joint aches in hands, minor headache, chills from fever.  Also injection site redness, which extended out for a few inches around the injection site itself.  This lasted about 3 or 4 days and was warm to the touch.  The fever etc. only lasted the one day (day after injection) and by day three I was fine.  Was not servere enough to keep me from working etc., but I did go to bed early that night.

                                                About 6 PM the day I received the vaccine, the arm started to become extremely sore. It was achy feeling and it radiated down to my wrist. This lasted until Sunday and it started to fade. Today it is just some soreness left at the injection site. I was taking OTC Acetaminophen 500MG between 100 MG for pain. It was difficult to sleep due to the pain. I was also putting cool compresses on it.  The pain worse when I was trying to clean my car and shovel the snow. However the cold compress and stretching did help with some of the pain. I also felt agitated for different periods times after vaccination, I felt like my hormones were out of whack and I wanted to &#34;bite someone&#39;s head off&#34; this lasted for about an 1 hour or so. I also had mild headaches.

It appears the name for that is now, Covid arm.  Today, 2/23/2021, the redness is fading and it is only slightly itchy.    Very mild tenderness when I touch it.  Checked my temp over the last few days and it was in the normal range 97.4-97.9 (for me).

I was sent to the emergency room where I was given an injection of Decadron and Pepcid and sent home with a prescription to take Prednisone for four days and Pepcid twice a day for 7 days.  The prickling decreased a little but has returned with tingling in the face, feet, legs and arms.

                                                Elevated blood pressure and heart rate. 163/116 HR 125. I got up at 9:00 am with elevated BP and HR. I had missed a dose of Metoprolol the previous evening. I felt shaky/jittery and checked my BP and HR. Called the doctor on call at my PCP&#39;s office and he stated it is probably rebound hypertension and elevated HR due to missing the dose of Metoprolol last night. His direction was to check in two hours, and if still elevated, take 1/2 tablet Metoprolol. Current readings at 2:00 pm are 129/97 HR 99. Unsure if related to Covid vaccine. MD recommended reporting to CDC

Rapid heart rate, nausea, felt like blood pressure was going up a lot.  Afraid I was on the verge of having a stroke. Symptoms hit abruptly with no warning. Were severe for about an hour and then started subsiding.  Gradually felt better over the course of a couple of hours. After about 6 hours, symptoms completely gone and I felt fine.

                                                Sharp, painful muscle cramps in both left and right feet and ankles, relieved by self-administered massage.   Cramping began when first lying down in bed, relieved by massage, then recurred about 20 minutes after falling asleep, and again relieved by self-administered massage.    Not persistent.   Did not recur after being relieved by self-administered massage the second time.   I was physically exhausted due to only 3 hours sleep the night before, so this may have been the result of exhaustion and not the vaccine, but has never happened before and seemed severe enough to file a report about it.  My arm was not particularly sore where vaccine administered and no other SE.

Lymph node is normal on January 9.

The following Saturday 1/30 the same area turned red again but this time very itchy and again swollen and soar.  Went to  but nurse practitioner was confused because  said injection is given higher on the arm in the muscle area.  Not sure if this is a reaction to the vaccine.  The confusions is because it?s the same arm after the vaccine was administered, so what else could it be from.

                                                I had been freezing all evening after the shot.  Went to bed as usual for the night.  Woke up about 1 am which is normal for me.  I was still freezing.  Got up to go to the bathroom as I normally do.  While sitting on the toilet, I started shaking violently - not just regular shivers.  This was scary.  Violent jerking from the waist up - head, arms, torso.  I could not control it.  Eventually it stopped.  I put on warmer clothes and climbed back into bed.  Eventually I warmed up and went to sleep.  Other minor side effects were same as the first vaccine - sore and tender around the injection sight and slight headache.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

                                                After receiving the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine the pt. (while walking around in the store with her husband) began to feel dizzy and weak. She came back to the pharmacy area and she was seated and had her blood pressure checked. It was high (194/84) but she reported that she does have high blood pressure and takes her med at night.  She was given a bottle of water, monitored and her blood pressure was checked twice again over the next 20 minutes. It read lower each time she was checked and when it read 156/84 she said she felt fine and was ready to leave with her husband. She also said she was diabetic and had eaten a small breakfast compared to normally. She will be contacted today to make sure she is still feeling ok.

                                                Monday 02/15/2021 a 3 inch egg shaped rash started appearing at injection site. No pain but itched. Started as a few red pimples but became red all over and swollen (possible hives?). Later in evening swollen lymph node (about 1)2 inch diameter) under chin near left ear. Felt very tender. Lymph node swelling reduced by next morning. Rash at injection remained. Has diminished in color but is still pink thru today 02/22/2021 and no more itch.  Took no action at all. Notified primary care physician Thurs 02/18/2021. Note that on Friday 02/12/2021 (prior to rash appearing) started prescription prilosec 40 mg 1 per day. Continued this thru Thurs 02/18/2021.  Discontinued prilosec after speaking with primary care physician. Don&#39;t know if this had anything to do with reaction.

                                                When I first got the vaccine I was fine but as the day went on I felt soreness in my left arm with some stiffness in my neck. Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

                                                Within 45 minutes of receiving the the Moderna injection I started with a headache and the beginning of hives. I took a Benadryl to stop the hives progression. I had to take antihistimes for several days.  The hives never popped up so the meds helped.  My head felt bruised and heated as if the blood was pumping around my skull.  The headaches are still intermittent 6 days later. I did not seek medical care.

Over next 36 hours fever was between 100-102. Nausea began 48 hours after injection.  It is now Tuesday, almost 4 days since injection and am still dizzy and weak.  Fever stopped yesterday and only light headache today.   My husband also had all my symptoms except a much lower fever.  We are wondering if we could have got a bad batch???  They said to expect 1-2 days of mild discomfort.  This was like the worst flu I&#39;ve ever had.

                                                The volunteer chose a landing mark for the needle which when stuck into my shoulder joint area, hit something, so he immediately withdrew that needle.  He then took a new second needle and chose a 2nd landing mark that was close to the first needle &#34;stick&#34; and delivered the vaccine.  I felt immediate burning  and that continued for much of the day.   The burning proceeded into intense pain.  I returned to the Senior Center at 7:30 a.m. the next morning and reported the error the volunteer made and showed the head nurse the bruise that was high - at my upper arm - and nearly on my shoulder.  The head nurse said it was &#34;high.&#34;   She asked me what I wanted her to do.  I responded that she should report the error and I would like it documented, as I was now afraid I might have endured a shoulder/joint injury.  I also called the health department and the Covid-19 Help Line  and reported the error.  I had two days of intense pain, where I could not physically, not just the excruciating pain, lift my arm.  I emailed an Orthopaedic doctor who specialized in shoulders and made an emergency apmt with him.  I also made an apmt with my primary.  My ortho doctor is treating me for SIVRA, I am on anti-inflammatories, I am having physical therapy on my left shoulder, as there is constant pain.  I am scheduled for return visits to my orthopaedic doctor and this appears to be a concern as far as damage, time course and outcome.  I hope the head nurse DID report the injury to my shoulder area.  She promised to record the event in &#34;my file,&#34;

Numbness/weakness in all fingertips and both legs to above the knees. The symptoms continued to increase and at 11:30 pm I was taken to ER. Was transported by ambulance to Hospital. Was admitted to the ICU. Lumbar puncture was done on 03/13/21 to rule out Guillain Barre. Neurologist determined it was a neurological reaction to the COVID vaccine shot. Was released from the hospital 03/15/21. Legs continue to be numb/weak, but I am able to walk carefully unassisted.

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

                                                I received the vaccine yesterday 1/6/21.  Today, 1/7/21, I went for my walk this morning and felt off balance/swayed to the right a bit at one point. I don&#39;t think lightheadedness precipitated this, but it unnerved me.  I steadied myself and finished the walk without a problem. I checked and surface/pavement was uneven. My temp is 97.5 and I feel fine now but am just a little nervous that is a possible reaction to the vaccine. I had a reaction to the second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine 10 yrs ago, I fainted in early morning hours after getting up to go to bathroom.  I had received the second dose at about 11:30a the day before, and developed flu like symptoms by afternoon with a fever and ended up dehydrated which I think contributed to my fainting at about 3a when I got up to void.  I had a concussion and was treated with IV fluids at the local ED.

                                                Almost 18 hours after the injection, my arm was painful, I began to run a fever above 102 degrees, I was so achey, I had to get help to get off the commode.  It hurt to roll over in bed.  I lost my taste and smell. It lasted approximately 24 hours.  I had Covid in June, 2020 and had all of the exact symptoms, 100 times worse than when I had Covid.  9 days later, I had fever above 102 again, chills, shaking for approximately 6 hours again.  Is this a normal reaction?

                                                Patient appeared nervous upon receiving vaccine. Patient reported trouble swallowing ( has a history of radiation therapy on throat). When asked if breathing was restricted, patient was able to take long breaths with minimal additional effort. Shortly after, patient appeared to be close to passing out (not completely awake and alert), eyes dilated. The pharmacist who administered the vaccine then administered one dose of the epinephrine (Epi-pen LOT:0FM353/eEXP:NOC 21) while the staff member kept the patient stable in her chair. The facility was instructed to call 911. At 11:49 AM (7 minutes later), symptoms began to improve and the patient became more alert. EMS arrived around 12:00PM to take patient to hospital--patient refused and was back walking around the facility 5 minutes later. No further issues were reported with this patient (pharmacist administering the vaccine left the facility around 1:15PM)

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine: My left arm was very sore starting in the evening of 1/6/2021. This soreness got worse over the next 2 days and then tapered off over the weekend.  On 1/11/2021, I started having pain in my left axillary region.  This pain increased into 1/12/2021.  Also, on 1/12, my left upper arm started hurting.  On 1/13, I still had pain in my left axillary region, and thespian in my left upper arm worsened.  Also, on 1/13 my left upper arm started itching.  Around 5pm on 1/13, I had a chance to look at my left upper arm and there was a large reddened area to my left upper arm which included the vaccine injection site.  This area was warm to touch.  About 5:30pm, I took 25mg of Benadryl.  I took another 25mg Benadryl at 11pm.  This morning (1/14), the redness is fading to the area on my left upper arm though itching remains.  There is slight pain to the area.  The pain to the left axillary region is much better-barely noticeable.  I reported this event to County Health Department and to my primary physician.

                                                When I received the vaccine I had only a mild response, a bit of soreness only, that went away in 24 hours. Then on day 7 post immunization I developed a reaction at the injection site.  There was a large (3 inch by 2 inch) raised reddish/pink area that was hard to the touch and warm.  It itched slightly.  It lasted 3 days and now it is starting to resolve.

                                                Got slightly dizzy as I stood up. Went to sit in observation room.  My heart was beating very fast for about 8 minutes.  Felt a tightness in my chest and had a slight bit of difficulty breathing.  Did not want to tell the monitors.  Afraid to go to a hospital with COVID.  My left hand turned blue and got cold and tingly.  That lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  So did the trouble breathing.  All subsided in 15 minutes.  Went home and took an antihistamine.  Had a light rash on my body.  Consulted with PCP and cardiologist.  They seem clueless.  We all agreed that i need the second dose but what is the antidote.  Cardiologist gave me a beta-blocker to take before the dose but these symptoms all appeared on the severe allergic reaction list.  The heart pounding was the most pronounced symptom.  What do I do?

                                                I woke up today, 1/22/2021, with an extremely itchy left arm. I also woke up 1 hour after the alarm went off, and was still lethargic. The source of the itch is a 1.5&#34; rash just below the vaccination site on my left arm.  The rash appears over a hard or swollen bump that is the same size as the rash.   I may also have a rash on my left neck because it itches, but I can&#39;t see or feel it.

                                                about 7 hours after injection, the site was sore and tingling. Throughput the evening, the tingling sensation progressed up the left side of my neck and my ear.  My ear felt similar s to Novacaine wearing off after a dental visit. During the night my throat got a similar sensation and created the need to try coughing it out. By 24 hours after the injection I was tired, with sore joints and muscle aches. By 36 hours I was still sleeping it off and at 48 hours I feel pretty well back to normal.

                                                Mild cellulitis; Headache; Sore arm; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced a sore arm, headache, and mild cellulitis.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included calcium and memantine hydrochloride.   On 28 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 026L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 28 Dec 2020, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had a sore arm for 2-3 days. She was worried that she would get a headache so she took ibuprofen.   On 03 Jan 2021, the patient had a low-grade headache but it was not a migraine. She took acetaminophen and ibuprofen but it did not help.   On 04 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s arm was a bit sore.   On 05 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s headache went away but she felt she had mild cellulitis. Her arm felt a little bit warm at the injection site, it was also swollen and red. These symptoms persisted for about 2 days and then began to get better. Treatment for the events included ibuprofen, acetaminophen and icing.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event, mild cellulitis, was considered resolving. The event, headache, was resolved on 05 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, sore arm, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 67year old, female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of cellulitis, and non-serious expected event of pain in extremity and headache. The event of pain in extremity occurred same day after first dose mRNA-1273 (Lot# 026L20A) administration. The event of headache occurred after 7 days and cellulitis occurred 9 days after mRNA-1273 (Lot# 026L20A) administration. The subject&#39;s concomitant medication included calcium and Biomentin. The treatment medications were included Tylenol, Advil and icing. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                When my fingers touched something cold they would feel weird and lose their color. The first time (1/21) was minor (one finger) and the second time was (1/23) and all the tips of my fingers of my right hand turned colorless when I touched something cold. 1/24 my toes tingled when I walked and happens when I go for a walk. The finger symptom seems to be diminishing. I have never had either of these things happen before I had the Moderna vaccine. My doctor told me not to have the second dose which is due on 1/30/2021.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after injection, felt an unusual sensation up my right arm, neck, into left ear. While driving home my face became warm, after arriving home face/cheeks extremely red/flushed.  Have a picture taken at 3:54 for documentation. Not sure if from anxiety, but felt jaw tightness and a thick tongue.  No itching, swallowing problems etc.   lasted approximately 15 minutes. By 4:57 pm redness had faded.   Picture documentation. 9:15 pm had right ear pain and mild reddened of right cheek.   Picture documentation.

                                                Day after shot had sore arm and was tired but those symptoms lasted about 24 hours.   Then 8 days after vaccine I developed a rash about 2 1/2 inches high by 3 inches wide about an inch or so below the injection site on left arm.  The rash is itchy and a little warm to touch.   Contacted allergy Dr. and was told to take an allergy pill.  Am also using cortisone cream.  Rash is a little better after about 24 hours but still there.  Today is 10 days after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Blanching red rash, diffuse, spreading out from injection site. Began approx 2 hrs from injection. Treated with OTC Benadryl. Occasional tingling, angioderma around mouth. Disssapated after Benadryl.  Rash is gradually fading and requires less Benadryl to keep in check.  Had similar reaction to Shrinyx vaccine 2 years ago.  Rash lasted 1-2 weeks without Benadryl treatment.

                                                During the first 24 hrs, symptoms included: redness, swelling and ache at site of injection; tiredness. On Jan 27th (7 days following vaccination) a large (2.5&#34; X 4&#34;) red area formed around the injection site on my arm and it began to ache and itch. I also had diarrhea which began in the middle of the night (2 am on Jan 28), with a total of 3 episodes over 3 hours. That day I was very tired, experienced intestinal upset  (w/ very small episodes of diarrhea) and my arm began to really ache and the swollen area became rather firm and hot. The intestinal episode is over but the hot red welt continues as of this report. Diarrhea is not a common condition for me.

                                                About nine days after my first vaccination, I experienced limited mobility and some discomfort with movement with my left shoulder. Since then I have let it rest from activities but  I have done range of motion exercises as well as strengthening exercises. I have also taken 400 mg of ibuprofen twice daily for about a week. I stopped the ibuprofen approximately a week later but I?ve continue to do strengthening and stretching exercises of my left shoulder with some improvement. I reported this both to my internal medicine doctor whom I have given you her name of as well as my sports Medicine doctor. They agreed with my regime . I still don?t have full range of motion as well as some pain with certain movements with my left shoulder.

                                                Last week 2/17/2021 she felt under her arm on the left hand side like her arm was aching, the achiness went across her back, then she felt it in her right arm.  Her arm felt warm, and realized it was the area where she got the vaccine.  She put some lotion on it, and just kept watching it and did not go away.  The hand started feeling funny, different feeling to it.  The redness was trying to travel underneath the arm and around it.   She took an allergy pill for it, which helped the itching at first, but now it&#39;s localized more to the area of the vaccine.  She does have an appointment today with her doctor.  She also took some Advil but going to wait to see what the doctor tells her to do.

On 2/19//2021 I also experienced repeat generalized symptoms: including repeat headaches. body aches &amp; extreme fatigue since 2/19/21 including today, which is  2/23/2021. I did not have the pronounced local reaction at the vaccination site on my L arm initially after the vaccination. When I looked up the delayed reaction online I realized some others have experienced this delayed reaction.

                                                I received my Covid-19 Moderna vaccine on February 12. Soon afterward, the pharmacy called and told me that they had accidently given me a double dose. They reported it to my primary care physician and both the pharmacy and my doctor stayed in close contact with me to monitor my health. I had the usual sore arm, a headache, and a little achy that evening, but nothing major. I noticed the next day that I had a hard lump about 3.5 inches below where my shot was given (not directly below, more toward the inside of my arm.) A small rash begin to develop, but after a few days the rash was gone, but the lump remained. Twelve days after my shot, the lump became very red and hot. The rash appeared again and basically moved up my arm. I kept putting a cortisone itch cream on it, but it was very uncomfortable. Two days after the rash appeared I became quite sick with what it felt like side effects ? chills that included violent shaking and temperature that reached 100.5. I had that for about 24 hours. Now the lump on my arm is gone, I no longer have rash, and my temperature is back to normal. I feel tired today, but probably because of the previous day?s temps and chills. I find it interesting that 2 weeks after my shot I would have those kind of reactions (unless this had nothing to do with the shot?)  I thought you might want to have this data, as it is an interesting side effect. My doctor wasn?t sure how to explain it either. I would be interested to see if others that might have gotten an overdose of the shot experienced anything similar.

About 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt nauseated but finally managed to sleep.  The next afternoon on February 23 I became very ill with vomiting and diarrhea all at the same time.  I nearly passed out several times.  First responders arrived and found my blood pressure to be about 70/30.  Got in ambulance and given fluids.  Arrived at hospital around 5:15 pm.  Got more fluids and numerous blood tests, none of which were very remarkable.  My WBC was 17 but nothing else was wrong.  Left hospital at 9:00.  Physician assumes Covid vaccine cause these side effects.

My arm is weak and cannot raise, lift or rotate it above the elbow.  Very difficult to maintain sleep with a throbbing arm. I have been taking Alleve and it helps but the pain is still there just milder. Muscles are not sore but something is aching deep in bone/joints. I went to the Kinesiologist who told me the rotor cuff is the issue. He did an pressure point &#34;adjustment&#34; and the pain subsided for a day or two and now I&#39;m back to being in pain during any level of movement again.  I believe that my injection was given too high in my shoulder and caused SIRVA. I even took a picture of where the injection site was given.  If needed I can provide it to you.

I was laid down, cold compress. It came in waves over a period of 20 minutes. I was given a few sips of water. When it did not resolve I was taken to the ER and given IV fluids.  The doctor said I had an adverse reaction to something in the vaccine. The chief of Infectious disease thought I had a vaso vagel response.  While I am nervous to get the second vaccine , I will go forward and get it..

The arm was also distinctly warm to the touch and tender.  During the first evening, I experienced chills and presumed fever that responded to 400 mg of Ibuprofen.  I experienced some nausea, loss of appetite, and malaise over the next three to four days after injection.

After 2 hours I got up and felt okay.

                                                Patient received vaccine at 1:48 pm then approximately 5 minutes afterwards fainted and fell to the floor while sitting in a chair. I went over and rolled patient over having her lay face up and then proceeded to ask her questions. We had a staff member called 911 while I was helping her.  I asked her how she felt and she responded and said she felt &#34;hot all over and dizzy.&#34; Her pulse was low (~40 bpm). 911 informed us to lie her down on the floor until EMS arrived which we already had been doing at the time. After getting off the phone with 911, she started feeling better and her pulse returned to a normal rate (~80 bpm). EMS still took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

She was still awake and responsive when I proceeded to ask her questions and she informed me she felt &#34;hot all over and dizzy.&#34; 911 informed us to keep her lying down on the floor as comfortable for her as possible until EMS arrives on scene. While waiting for EMS to arrive her pulse was low (~40 bpm), but shortly before EMS arrived on scene her pulse rose to a normal heart rate (~80 bpm). EMS then took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                Fainted; Did not feel well; Hit head; A little pain in arm; A spontaneous report was received from a 68-year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced the events, fainted, hit head, did not feel well, and a little pain in arm.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Relevant concomitant medications reported included ezetimibe, atorvastatin, and atenolol.   On 04 Jan 2021 at 9:00 am, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient reported that she took the vaccine on 04 Jan 2021 and she did not feel anything after but a little pain in her arm.   On 05 Jan 2021 around 7:00 pm, the patient went to her fridge for a drink and told her husband she did not feel very well, and then fainted. The patient reported that she hit her head and has never fainted before. No treatment information was reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome for the events, fainted, hit head, did not feel well, and a little pain in arm, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 68-year-old female patient  with unknown medical history, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Syncope, the non-serious listed event of Pain in extremity, and the non-serious unlisted events of Head injury and Malaise.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events on the day after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

As the day progressed I started having body aches, headache, and some chills. It only lasted for that day and I was fine on 1/22/2021. I have never had a reaction to a shot before so it was worrisome. I am fine now.

The inside of my upper lip on the left side also became very sore.  And my inner labia on the left side became very sore and itchy.  On 01/18, I examined those areas and found a large blistered area on my inner lip.  On 01/19, in addition to the red, painful area on my inner labia, there were multiple blisters. I have a history of HSV-1 in the genitals. I take Valtrex 500 mg daily. I had an appointment with my GYN?s NP on 1/20.  They ordered Valtrex 1 GM for 5 days, and to repeat that when I get my second dose, which is scheduled for 2/7/21. The blisters are now resolving.

The redness then returned about 3 days later, to a size of about 4 x 4 inches, with mild itching. again slight swelling, and warmth which have persisted now into day 11.  It does seem to be improving / fading with warm soaks several times a day.  I have never had a response to a vaccine like this before.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Monday, 2-15-21. 11:45 am. ? Received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.  12:30 pm. ? Headache developed.   8:00 pm. ? Watching TV noted irregular heartbeat, and a minute later, increase in respiration rate.  That lasted 20 minutes at the most, and then went away.  Went to bed at 10 pm and slept well.  Tuesday, 2-16-21. 7:00 am. ? In kitchen. Lightheaded, increased respiration, feeling like I?m going to pass out, so I quickly sit down.  Two minutes later feel fine.  Went about making breakfast.  This happened two more times.  Realizing this might be a reaction to the vaccination, went to urgent care.  Doctor listened to my heart, ordered EKG and result showed that I was in atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).  NO previous cardiac issues, no high blook pressure, no diabetes, never a smoker, not obese.   Ambulance was called to take me to Hospital.  Another EKG confirmed still in A-Fib.  Blood drawn.  Hooked me up to a wireless/remote heart monitor.  Still in A-Fib, elevated heart rate, higher than normal blood pressure.  Kept overnight in hospital awaiting more test results, continuous monitoring, and with ECG ordered for Wednesday morning and then consultation with cardiologist.  Wednesday, 2-17-21.  11:45 am., ECG done.  Still in A-Fib. ECG shows no signs of blood pooling or clotting.  Cardiologist proposed courses of action, starting with what makes sense based on current conditions:  A cardioversion.  Having done thousands (his words) and given my great state of health otherwise, and very low risk for complications, a cardioversion is agreed to.  That would happen immediately after first doing a Tee (transesophageal echocardiography) to look at the back of my heart.  Then if all looks clear, no clotting, proceed with the cardioversion procedure.   3:00 pm., anesthesiologist asks if I have any further questions. I didn?t. He sedates me.  At 3:17 pm. I open my eyes, see the cardiologist standing at the foot of the gurney giving me thumbs up.  I returned the thumbs up and said to him, ?good job.?  Heartbeat successfully restored to normal rhythm by the cardioversion procedure.  6:00 pm. (approximately) - Discharged from hospital with prescription for Eliquis and Lopressor, and instructions for follow up appointments with primary care physician, and with cardiologist.

                                                After receiving the shot at 9:00 a.m., at 6:00 p.m. I started to feel very tired and as if I was getting a fever.  By 9:00 p.m. I was shaking from chills (despite being bundled up under a blanket), so I took my temperature -- it was 100.5 degrees orally.  My normal temperature on that thermometer is 97.6 degrees.   That night, I kept waking up every two hours or so and was very uncomfortable.  THe next day I felt very lethargic -- unable to do anything other than make myself something to eat.  I took two naps, one in the morning, and the other in the afternoon (that was about two hours).  I felt slightly better by around 8 p.m.  That night I slept somewhat better and felt myself break into a sweat during the night -- so I guess that is when the fever broke.  The next day (today) my temperature was back to normal and I feel okay.  Throughout the now three days, the arm where I got the shot was painful, but gets less so each day.

So hard, I still felt cold, but this wasn?t shivering,  I wanted to go to get in warm water.  I was shaking so bad I couldn?t take my clothes off.   I got in with clothes on, I was getting delirious.   My whole body was contracting so hard I couldn?t sit in the tub flat, my but cheeks contracting with all muscles.   I found myself in the night with a sticking hat soaked in water to cover my face.  I could not have called for help when the muscle contractions  were going on.  That lasted I think 30-45 minutes.  I was groggy on the 20th all day but getting much better.   I was very excited for vaccine and would do it again, but wanted to report what I consider pretty rough side effect, so you could make note of it. And I still thank you for the vaccine,  but dang I truly thought I was dying.

Most people say they don&#39;t even feel it, but I definitely felt the needle  go in and then felt the fluid go in.  By late afternoon, my left arm was very sore .  By  evening, I  couldn&#39;t lift my arm at all  due to pain in  that muscle at the top of my shoulder.  I think by that night but perhaps by the next morning I still couldn&#39;t lift my arm and the pain had gone into my neck on the left side.  After about 36 hrs, it started getting better but it was extremely sore for at least 4 days.   I still have some residual pain in my left arm and the base of my neck on that side.     About 4 days ago, I noticed  a round bruise about the size of a quarter about 1.5 inches away from where I think the shot was administered.  I am not aware of anything that might have caused it, but Im pretty sure it wasn&#39;t where the shot  was administered.  It seems to be growing a bit from when I first noticed it.

                                                I had the virus in August of 2020 for 30 days until symptom free.  ON 2/6/2021 received first vaccine injection.  within 3 minutes a light headache started.  That evening, rash and itching on right fore-arm and under chin. took benedryl. Woke at 3:30 am on 2/7 not feeling well and left arm very sore and could not touch.  6:30 am - chills with severe body shaking and 101 temp.  7:30 am 102.2  took tylenot 8 hr 650 mg. Oxygen at 96, heart rate at 76 and BP 117/68. 8:00 am 101.9 temp. 10 am 100.6 temp. 1:30 pm 102.9 temp. 2:00 pm 103.3  Took Tylenol, extra strength 2 tabs. 8:30 pm used inhaler due to chest pains  101.3 temp. took benedryl.  Oxygennn @98  HR-82 BP 145/77.  11.00 pm 103.3 temp. took 2 tylenol.  Mon 8:00 Monday am continued/ 100.2 temp  oxygen 97  HR-70; 99.2 temp  BP 110/71.  7 pm. took Benedryl for congestion.   Quit taking stats.  Fatigue and rest took play at this point.  Since then have had intermittent low grade fever in 99.2 to 99.9.  Same with headache and extreme fatigue.  Have high risk husband that I take care of .  He had his first vaccine at same time.  No side effect at all.  I am scheduled for 2nd vaccine on March 6th.  I am very apprehensive about taking it with this reaction.  Please advise/recommend if I should proceed.  My PCP stated that these reactions were evidence the vaccine is working.  Is this because I had the virus???  Both the virus and vaccine have been really hard on me.  I am usually a very active person and since August, I have been struggling with fatigue.  First time in life.   Thank you.

                                                I started seeing stars after showering the morning after receiving my shot and eventually blacked out, fell, and struck my head.  When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

My left arm was tingling from the elbow down to the side of my hand and my ring and little fingers and palm of my hand were numb.  The tingling in my left arm has not stopped since then, my left elbow is sore to the touch and the two fingers tingle and are numb.  The flu symptoms subsided by the following day but the numbness and tingling in my left hand has continued.

Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25.

I also became exhausted.  I realized I had been tired much of the first day but once my arm became so painful, I was completely exhausted.  I felt out of sorts for about  36 hours and then began to feel normal again.  It probably took a few more days to regain my energy completely.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA About 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine she felt dizzy and lightheaded and felt like she was going to pass out.  She is a type II diabetic but they did not have any ability to check her blood sugar at employee health.  Therefore, rapid response team was called and patient was brought here to the emergency department.  Patient notes that she has had a couple of syncopal episodes in the past in her life and has had several near syncopal episodes.  Upon arrival to the ED her blood sugar was noted to be 99.  She is feeling little bit better but still just a little bit dizzy.  She was completely and entirely asymptomatic prior to getting the vaccine shot.  She has not been ill lately.  BP 116/68  | Pulse 62  | Temp 36.7 °C (98.1 °F) (Oral)  | Resp 15  | Ht 1.524 m (5&#39;)  | Wt 229 lb 8 oz (104 kg)  | SpO2 100%  | BMI 44.82 kg/m² 69-year-old female presented to the emergency department following a near syncopal episode after getting her COVID-19 vaccine.  She is normotensive, not tachycardic, tachypneic or hypoxic.  She has a normal physical exam and normal cardiopulmonary exam.  Lab work-up shows a mild chronic anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.9.  BMP, chest pain panel normal.  EKG was normal.  Patient was kept on cardiac monitoring and given oral fluids.  We then got her up and she was ambulatory without symptoms and without difficulty. Therefore, this appears to be a vasovagal near syncopal episode that has resolved.  Work-up here is negative.  No further work-up is indicated.  Will discharge home, rest, fluids, cautioned her that she might feel poorly for a day or 2.  Follow-up with primary care as needed.  Return for worsening symptoms.

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

She tells me she has &#34;a heart condition&#34; and is followed by a cardiologist. She tells me she was in her usual state of health and took her COVID-19 first vaccine today.  Approximately 30 seconds later she noted chest tightness/burning that has been constant.  It is rated 9/10 at maximum and improved to 5/10 after about 10 to 15 minutes.  She also states, &#34;my eyes feel funny.  I feel cold.  I am dizzy.&#34; She endorses palpitations and dyspnea. She denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, diaphoresis, headache, cough, rash, or syncope. She does have a history of seafood allergies and had similar reactions after eating seafood. She tells me 3 years ago after a flu shot she fainted.  She tells me the past 2 years after her flu shot she had nausea or vomiting. She tells me she fell yesterday and hurt her hip but she did not hit her head.  No LOC. She tells me she takes baby aspirin nightly. Family history: Mom and dad both died at age 82 from lung cancer.  They both had heart disease.   She was sent back from the vaccination area to urgent care to be evaluated after her reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine.

Saw my primary physicia and she was unsure what was happening. We agreed to monitor the arm and call if it got worse or I had other symptoms. The following two days found the red rash becoming more of a bulls eye. The outer ring was red with the inner bulls eye brown, same coloring as a birthmark. The upper arm continues to ache, but swelling is down and today, Monday, January 25, it is still discolored, but brown rather than red.

                                                I received the injection around 2:30 I felt fine. It did not hurt going in. I stopped by a restaurant to get some take out and must of started feeling disorientated and completely forgot I had this folder with the VSAFE information. I started feeling chills all over my body, I kept taking my temperature it was 95.7, I started having a headache top of my head, the temporal, the back of my neck. They were all over the place. I went to bed and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It was like my brain was going crazy, it wasn&#39;t like an anxious feeling. I finally feel asleep around 4am and kept waking up remembering fragments of valid dreams. The dreams were fragment with such dread and anxiety in them.  It was like a huge wave of depression and anxiety. By about 9am I was fully awake, but my body hurt, my muscles ached I felt fatigued. The chills and headaches were through. I was still having weird racing thoughts. About 10pm it all went away and I slept fine and woke up the next morning and I was fine. My arm is still sore at the injection site but all the other symptoms went away.    Saturday morning I was talking with a friend on the phone, and she reminded me of the folder I received the folder. I completely forgot about this folder. I found this folder later that day and then I tried to access VSAFE. It made me realize how disorientated I was.

                                                A week after vaccine felt a pain on her arm, no redness. Had lumps on the arm initially did compressions and no reaction.  Pain is similar to shingles pain.  When she works on it it comes down but it&#39;s still there.  Pain is tolerable but is annoying due to it lingering.  Still has the discomfort today.

Started with severe chills, body shaking, achy all over, head felt like it was going to implode, started to sweat and felt flushed.  Woke up my spouse to get me something to take for headache, etc.  Later that morning could hard lift the Arm, felt a golf ball size lump at injection site and warm to the touch. Was in bed 2 days bcuz it exacerbated my MS.  After that the injection site started itching, with redness.  Lump finally getting smaller.  I took a photo of the injection site which has a red circle the size of my hand.

Then is eased. then it began again about 12:30 pm and lasted until 5:30 PM roughly. Jan 9th i felt okay. On Jan 10, 11th, 12th it returned. Then after the 12th it eased, and there was spiritic shaking but not has intense and those three days. Then 16 days after i had the injection on jan 24th i woke up in the morning i developed sensitivity the left temple of my head close to my eye on the left side of my face. Kind of feels like slight bruising and numbing. And my left eye lid feels heavy. and my vision feels slightly affected. That has continued through today Jan 29 and has been on going since the 24th.

                                                I am concerned they injected  high, above the muscle.  They had trouble getting the injection in, it burned a lot, she kept asking me to relax my muscle (which was relaxed) and when I took the Band-Aid off it looked high. I took a photo at the time, because of my concern.   My shoulder joint was quite sore and stiff the next few days. 3 1/2 weeks later I still have an aching burning pain;  it feels as if they hit the shoulder capsule or the periosteum.   My questions are as follows:  Do you think this is too high to inject? Do you think I will have gotten enough absorption anyway?  Is there a way to get measured for the antibody response in this situation?  Should this be reported as an adverse event?  ( I hate to get anyone upset at our hospital, as I am grateful I got the vaccine and intend to get the booster Will this affect the booster?

                                                A few hours after my vaccination, my arm became extremely sore and was extremely sore all night, and remained so the next day. I have a high pain tolerance, but my arm felt as if it had received a powerful injury, and was hard to lift without using my other arm.  I also had a slight fever the next day, chills and muscle aches and fatigue. I am normally very active, but spent the day in bed. The next day I felt much better although my arm was very sore for another day or two. Then, the evening of the 21st of Feb., my arm, at the vaccination site became very itchy and was painful to touch in that area. I slept well but woke with the same itchiness, and soreness, and now tonight, Feb. 22nd, that area is still itchy and a bit sore. But I have not had the swelling and redness that I am reading about with Covid arm.

My stomach was queasy.  By the next morning, my joints hurt so much it was difficult to roll over in bed, and all the other symptoms were still there and worse.  I did not have a fever.  I developed a headache.  All I could do was lie in bed; sitting up felt exhausting.  By evening of that day, my joint pain was lessening and my stomach felt somewhat better.  By the following morning, I felt normal, basically.  So in total, about a day and a half of bad reaction.

Speech and motor functions never returned, and one abscess was so large that it caused a brain shift ( the two hemispheres separated) they performed brain surgery and it was not successful. She passed away on 3/31/2021 at 431 am.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Lyme disease. Concomitant products included FAMOTIDINE (PEPCID AC) for Acid reflux (esophageal), PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM SESQUIHYDRATE (PANTOPRAZOLE 40) for Acid reflux (oesophageal), CYCLOBENZAPRINE for Antiinflammatory therapy, ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM (LIPITOR) for High cholesterol, TRAZODONE for Insomnia, HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE, CLARITHROMYCIN, AMOXICILLIN and DOXYCYCLINE for Lyme disease, PREGABALIN (LYRICA), DIAZEPAM (VALIUM) and CLONAZEPAM (KLONOPIN) for Nerve pain, OXYCODONE and ZOLPIDEM TARTRATE (AMBIEN) for an unknown indication.   On 15-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. In January 2021, the patient experienced TREMOR (Tremor/hand was shaking was dropping things/whole body just shakes) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSSTASIA (had trouble standing) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and MALAISE (feeling sick) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced APHASIA (couldn&#39;t talk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (memory started to go/ memory was getting worse/ couldn&#39;t remember what day it was) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), FALL (tried to get out of bed and fell) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ANXIETY (getting anxiety ridden) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, TREMOR (Tremor/hand was shaking was dropping things/whole body just shakes) had not resolved and DYSSTASIA (had trouble standing), MALAISE (feeling sick), APHASIA (couldn&#39;t talk), MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (memory started to go/ memory was getting worse/ couldn&#39;t remember what day it was), FALL (tried to get out of bed and fell) and ANXIETY (getting anxiety ridden) outcome was unknown.            The patient thought that the tremors might have been due to the Hydroxychloroquine and because she was also feeling sick, she stopped taking the Hydroxychloroquine, but continued taking the Clarithromycin. The tremors continued. Her doctor advised her to resume taking the Hydroxychloroquine, starting with ĵ pill, then ½ pill working her way up in dosing. The patient reported that her hand tremors never stopped.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not Applicable.

What surprised me is that the site (about 9 cm round) became very red and very itchy a full week later (01/05/2021) and is still pink and itchy now.  This is not at all serious, and Benadryl cream reduces the itching.  I am reporting it only because it is not listed as a side effect on the documentation or CDC website.

                                                I felt fine until the morning of Jan. 10 (except for very painful arm).  I was awakened early in the morning by severe vertigo (my eyes were blinking rapidly and the room was spinning violently); I was nauseous and couldn&#39;t lie down without the violent spinning re-occurring.  I was very dizzy and exhausted the whole day, unable to function.  The next day I continued to be very dizzy and off-balance, couldn&#39;t work but better than prior day.  Each day, same symptoms have continued but milder.  I called my PCP on Monday, Jan 11.  He told me it sounded like an inner ear problem, probably unrelated to the vaccine and to call him the next day and report my symptoms.  I did (Tues. Jan 12) and reported dizziness was milder but still there.  He suggested I see an ENT doctor.

My big concern is that I also  suddenly developed dark, stringy images and blurry vision in my left eye. The eye symptoms are still present.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccination on Saturday January 16th 2021 at approximately 12pm. She completed all necessary screening forms and was deemed to be at low risk for serious allergic reactions. She tolerated the vaccination well, and no complications or immediate adverse events occurred. She was observed for a full 15 mins per CDPHE/CDC guidelines and left the Clinic in stable condition after her observation period was complete. On the morning of Tuesday, January 19th, 2021, the patient was found unconscious and unresponsive by her husband. She was transferred by Ambulance to Hospital shortly thereafter. She was diagnosed with a brain bleed that was determined to be inoperable. She was transferred to other Hospital for higher level care. She was seen by neurosurgery and diagnosed with a ruptured aneurysm. She was treated in the ICU for 24 hours, at which point her team determined that the severity of her brain bleed would not respond to treatment. Supportive cares were withdrawn on Wednesday Jan 20th, and she passed away shortly thereafter.

When I get migraines, it&#39;s usually 1-2 times a month.  Once I treat it, it doesn&#39;t come back.  This headache returned about 7 hours later on January 21.  I treated it again.  I got another headache today, January 22 at 11 AM.  I treated it again with my medication.

                                                After injection on 01/16/2021, within 2 days all soreness had dissapted along with swelling and redness.  On 01/24/2021 roughly at 04:45 A.M., I began to chill/shiver.  The injection site on my right arm had become hot to the touch, peppered with red blotches, swollen and began to hurt again.  I did take 1000mg of Tylenol for discomfort.  I felt flushed, but no fever to speak of, rather lethargic.  Today, 01/25/2021, the injection site is one large reddened, hot, swollen area about a size 3x4 inches.  At this time, I have not visited my physician or any Urgent Care.

My heart rate was elevated and elevated blood pressure.  Went to the ER and checked to make sure I was not having a stoke. Today 1/25/2021, I feel drained and groggy but the numbness has gone.

The pain seemed to be in whole leg and seemed to be muscular and also a lot of pain in hip joint area.  Also was feeling a burning and numbness sensation down my leg.  By 7pm was in bed because it was too painful to walk.  Took 600 mg of Ibuprofen.  This morning the hip pain is better and I am walking ok. I still have burning and numbness mostly in the calf area of left leg. I am also feeling burning and numbness on the left area of my lip. This is an area of my lip where I have had cold sore in past but don&#39;t see a cold sore.

At the initial visit, the provider thought the patient had cellulitis.  Therefore a course of 7 days of Keflex was given. Patient finished her antibiotic and those symptoms still persisted. She came back to her primary care with still mild erythema and warmth of the left lateral arm.  At this time, her doctor diagnosed her with a local reaction to the COVID vaccine  and the patient was sent home with triamcinolone which she had.

                                                After first vaccination on Jan. 11th, 2021 I had muscle weakness in legs lasting only about an hour. I just didn?t feel right. After one hour I was fine.  Second vaccine was administered on Feb. 8th at noon. By 3:30 AM Feb 9th I could barely get out of bed because of severe joint pain and aching. I was nauseated, had a mild fever, mild headache and very tired. This lasted until  February the 10th at which time I felt better. By Feb. 11th I had return of deep aching pain in my hips and pelvic bones. ( I have arthritis and know what joint pain is). This was much worse. I felt ill from about one week after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna. I started feeling much better with the occasional return of mild symptoms.  I go to physical therapy for arthritis pain and had taken a week off. I returned to physical therapy on Thursday. February 18th. I was unable to complete my usual workout due to weakness in my legs and joint pain. I returned on Feb. 22nd and the same thing happened I felt weak, diaphoretic, nauseated,  after exercising a short time. This has never happened before.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up at 2:15 a.m. feeling pains in my chest middle and extending through to my upper back.  The pain encompassed the span of my upper chest and back from one arm to the other.  I experienced very rapid heartbeats that I could feel throbbing from my head to my chest.  I was hesitant to move or rise from my bed because of the pain.  At 3:40 I called 911.  They did an EKG and I was told that my heart was fine.  My blood pressure was 180/90.  I chose not to go to the hospital but to call my doctor when his office opened up at 9:00 a.m. in approximately 5 hours.  My doctor had me come into his office.  I had another EKG which was fine and he sent me to have a Cat Scan. the same day which was also fine.  My doctor spoke to me and said that he felt that this was due to side effects of the vaccine.  I doubled up on my Acid Reflux medicine, taking 80 mg daily for  four days through Monday 2/22/2021.  I could not sleep well for three days after the vaccine experiencing pain in my chest and could not breathe deeply without feeling it.  Then I steadily improved and today I can take deep breaths with little pain.  I also experienced muscle pain in my left shoulder and neck but used Mineral Ice on my neck and was relieved in one day.

The next morning headache began again and started vomiting at 7:45 a.m. thru out the morning until 11:30 a.m.  I could not eat anything , tried eating a piece of toast &amp; after one bite the vomiting began again.  I vomited again at 3:15 p.m.  Tried again to eat white rice and immediately began vomiting again.  On Thursday morning had a slight headache with no vomiting.  Friday I felt OK, just weak from all the vomiting.  Saturday morning I felt Okay, then suddenly I felt dizzy and though I was going to faint.  My daughter immediately told me that she was driving me to the ER because I was pretty dehydrated.  Was diagnosed with dehydration at the ER.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First symptoms appeared about 8PM the evening of the shot - a feeling of being weighted down, with extra difficulty in moving about.  I went to bed early and when I woke up I had a fever of 101.5 accompanied by chills, body aches, nausea, fatigue, brain fog, and headache.  Over the course of two days, my temperature ranged from 101.5 to 103.  After two days my fever broke during the night.   I did not want to take fever reducing medication in case it interfered with the immune response, but I did take 1 dose each of Tylenol and Motrin over the course of the 2 days.  Still felt a bit sluggish on the 3rd day and continue to have brain fog 6 days later.

                                                symptoms since her dose of Covid Moderna vaccine on Jan the 25th.  In the first 1-2 days she had the usual soreness at the injection site but nothing else. Then, about a week after it, her arm in the area of the injection site gradually became red and warm and indurated slightly without pain About the same time she noted a sense of fatigue and feverishness. Her temp was 100.4 or thereabouts. This persisted for a couple of days with no fever in the morning or midday but feverishness in the late afternoon /early evening and the temp always between 100.2 100.4. The redness of the upper arm increased to an area of about 2x3 inches. On Feb 2nd or 3rd she began a ten day course of penicillin 500mg qid x 24 hr then 250 mg qid x 9 days. The redness, induration and warmth improved and returned to normal gradually over the next 5 days or so. She stopped the penicillin on Feb 12th. Her temperatures in the late afternoons during the time of taking the penicillin were mostly between 100 and 100.4 and in the final couple of days of taking the penicillin it seemed to be resolving. The day after the penicillin it was 99. However, on the 15th it was 101. and since then it has been about 100.4 Her arm still appears normal  .  Other symptoms she is complaining of bilateral lateral hip pain. She feels quite achy. She believes this started since the vaccine dose I believe she may have had some complaints prior to it. No joint complaints, no upper extremity symptoms other than as above. No HA, ST. She has had what she describes as &#34;spasms in her chest&#34;) which has improved but presented about the same time as the arm and temperature did. No Gi symptoms. Her activity has not been curtailed. Neck pain bilat was noted starting the end of December without other symptoms and wo any hx of trauma and did not feel like a typical wry neck.    No travel other than for the vaccine, to the grocery store and rarely to another shop. No exposures to anyone other than our grandchildren, son and dau-in-law who are in our &#34;bubble&#34; (the granddaughter attends an out door preschool where they all wear masks and have had no covid cases.Patient walks weekly out doors with a friend. She sees her mother who at 96 resides at home and sees no one.  She had a NP swab for Covid PCR test yesterday (the 17th) which is reported this am as &#34;undetected&#34;.  An evaluation with Doctor led to blood work showing wbc 9.2, hgb 11, plt 546k, ESR 74, CRP 67 a diagnosis of PMR was tentatively made and she was started on prednisone 15 mg /d.  Improvement was seen at 24 hours and persisted. Neck pain is 80% better as well.  Questions: Did the vaccine play a role in exacerbating a preceeding condition of PMR? If the neck pain is a red herring, did the vaccine cause PMR?

A little muscle soreness, a little tired feeling but not enough to keep me from my morning routine of going to church at 7:00 a.m.   I got home around 8:00 am, muscles ache now, and tired feeling more pronounced.  I took two Advil around 8:30 a.m..  but by 10:00 a.m. I had a low grade fever of 100.2.  which subsided for a few hours, then returned late afternoon  around 4:00 pm at 100.4 degrees.  Tired and achy feeling continued the rest of 2/22/2021.  Morning of 2/23/2021, did not get up at regular time nor go to church...general &#34;washed out&#34; feeling, muscle aches improved.  Long nap in the afternoon and woke feeling better.  Today, 2/24/2021  I am back to normal. Went to church, grocery store and plan on doing my 3 mile walk later today if it warms up enough!

I read possible side effects.  It said flu  like symptoms, so we thought it would pass.  Then around 4 she called for me &amp; when I got there she had an event that caused her to be unable to speak &amp; her eyes widened &amp; pupils were dilated.  I called 911. They got here quick.  She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

I was shaky for a couple of more hours.  I had an upset stomach. I was very cold, but had waited in a 2 hour line outside in 20 degree weather because they were overwhelmed at the facility. And only had 3 doctors giving the shots.    I was able to swallow the whole time.

                                                I had a sore arm for a couple of days.  Thursday I woke up early with my nose filled with loose congestion.  I had chills and was exhausted all day, I took a couple of naps, but registered 95 degrees on the thermometer, so no fever.  The next morning I felt weak and nauseated, but I was fine by 10 a.m.

                                                On the first day of the injection (1/14/2021) the left arm was sore and I felt tired. Towards evening and during the night I felt cold and hot at the same time - an intense burning/freezing sensation, but no sweating. On the first day after the injection (1/15/201) the arm was still sore and I still felt tired - burning/freezing sensation had ceased. On the second day after the injection (1/16/2021) the left arm was not sore and I felt better, but at 11:00 a.m. the vein in the left temple burst and bled until about 6:00 p.m. Continuous throbbing pain across the forehead the entire day. The  middle of the forehead is covered with red dots; the area near the left eye has a number of open, bloody lesions; the area below the temple (left cheek) is black and blue. There are also two bright red spots on my left knee - but no bleeding. Nausea was slight, but present during the entire day on Saturday and Sunday. Since the hospitals have Covid 19 patients and I do not have a car, I stayed home and rested in bed.  Today on Sunday (1/17/2021) I can sit up and walk around somewhat; the throbbing pain in the head has ceased. The lesions are still vivid red , but slowly forming a crust.  Will make contact with my doctor  on Monday, when the office is open.

                                                I spoke to my sister on the phone an hour or two after she got the vaccine and she was slurring her words.  The next day around 5:38 someone called me to say she was found on the floor in the bathroom between the toilet and the wall.  I believe she passed out because she has no recollection of what happened at that time.   She was also reported as having a very dry mouth and sweating by the staff.   She was taken to  ER after they found her in the bathroom. She is currently having trouble getting around, has pain and is very tired.  She seems to be improving though.

                                                COVID-19 vaccine EUA. My shot was on Thursday morning. Sunday morning I woke up and the instant I moved the world swirled around me. I have never experienced that sensation before. Every time I changed position or moved my head the swirling happened for five days. The swirling lessened daily afterwards for about 3 more days. I messaged my Dr. But didn&#39;t go to see anyone.

He has a degenerative muscle disease (Inclusion Body Myositis) so is already very weak, wheelchair bound. House is set up with all lift chairs or elevated (Bed, Toilet) so he can get out of them with very weak legs. By mid morning he was not able to use legs or arms at all to get up and had difficulty holding head up (usually no problem). By afternoon temperature went to 103.6. and he ached all over. After 2 - 3 hours with dose of 2 extra strength Tylenol temperature came down to 100.6 and then another hour later he became very sweaty all over body and temp returned to normal. Continued very weak for a few days. Gradually regained strength and back to normal strength for him over 6 days.

Stayed that way until yesterday, 1/28/21, was able to raise the left eyebrow and her lip was starting to normalize, but still having some droopiness from it.  Called her provider and looked it up on the internet, and was told she had Bell&#39;s Palsy.  Told her to keep an eye on it, and if anything else happened to go into the hospital to see if it was a stroke.  It did not affect her limbs or have any other stroke symptoms, just the left side of her face.

During the night, the same symptoms.  A little more painful today, also noted red marks on the back area and arm.  Appears to be Shingles.  Also yesterday I had a slight discomfort in my Left chest.  That remains today.

The patient&#39;s medical history included epilepsy.  Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included clonazepam.  On 03 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The patient was slurring her words and fell into a deep sleep.  It took three individuals to wake her up.  The patient wondered if she passed out.  She felt tingly in her upper right arm and it felt like her equilibrium was off, and legs were heavy.  The patient was very fatigued.    Treatments of these events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, passing out, unsteadiness, slurring words, fell into a deep sleep, tingly feeling in her upper right arm, felt like equilibrium was off, legs felt heavy and fatigue, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71 year old female subject, with history of epilepsy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness after first dose of mRNA1273 (Lot# unknown).

                                                4 days after the vaccine, I had EXCRUCIATING nerve pain, starting at the upper vertabrae and  shooting down both arms to fingertips. Sometimes all the way down my back and the back of my legs.  I vomited all day, had a low fever which  lasted for 24 hours, then the pain and fever subsided. Still have nausea but no more vomiting .  I went to a doctor  after that, he also thinks it was a reaction..  On the 7th day, a purple splotchy rash showed on my skin and my hands started swelling up at night, so painful I couldn&#39;t even pull up the sheet.  The hand swelling goes down during the day and comes back at night.  I plan to get an antibody test  on  Feb. 26.  I am 98% certain that I had COVID in July, it was precisely the same symptoms and I had with the vaccine.  No treatment, just resting tilll it&#39;s over.  I am almost 80% better now, but not completely. I worry that I will never get back to 100%, it&#39;s been  11 days now.

                                                About 1 hour and 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine I became dizzy.  3 1/5 hours later I developed chills which lastly briefly. The next day I had  huge area on my  left eye on my pupil which lasted for 5 days. I have blue eyes and right at toward the end of the blue I have white deposits.  On  2/24/2021 I went  see an eye doctor Dr. He diagnosed me with &#34;whiss&#34; ring around both of my eyes, and seen spot on my lenses on my left eye.  I started starburst with my left eye, this did not develop until after I received the vaccine.  I have a dot on my right eye now. On 02/26/2021 see another eye doctor Dr., he also said I have deposits around my cornea, acknowledged the starburst effect on the left eye, and noticed the &#34;whiss&#34; ring.  Since I took the vaccine my eyes have become very light sensitive.  The doctors have told me this conditions are permanent, if it gets worse they will have to scrape the eye and have a laser surgery.  I do  not remember when it started but it 2inches by 3 inches, red patch which started at the injection site and went diagonal.

                                                Neurology consult note 2/16: The patient is a 72-year-old woman, who states that last Friday she began to notice a strange fullness and numbness and perhaps a mild degree of weakness in her right leg and came to  Emergency Room.  She was seen by ER doctors.  Diagnosis was unclear.  She was offered admission to get physical therapy, but she did not wish to stay for the weekend and returned home on Friday the evening only to come back to the ER on Sunday, 2 days later with progression of further right leg weakness, right leg numbness and a hint of new left-sided symptoms that had not begun before Sunday.  None of her symptoms involve the arms or face and everything was below the waist.  There was no significant pain.  She has not had a bowel movement since Thursday and has lost the ability to void.  Her MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine was reviewed by me on the computer monitor and was unrevealing except for mild DJD.  Thoracic MRI scan shows possible spinal cord infarction versus myelitis occurring within the thoracic spine at the dorsal surface of the cord at the T5 and T6 vertebral body levels to the right of midline.  This was a faint finding and not clearly infarct or myelitis and could be artifact.  It appears that she has hydronephrosis on her scans too and now is using a Foley catheter.  She does have a history of high cholesterol for which she takes a statin at home and was taking a baby aspirin a day when the above symptoms occurred. In summary, the patient has a 72-year-old woman, who presents with progressive right lower extremity weakness and now evolving left lower extremity weakness.  This may be related to an autoimmune process such as myelitis or less commonly cord ischemia.  Normally, I would start her on Plavix, but I think she may need to undergo spinal tap tomorrow if MRI scan of the brain and cervical spine are unrevealing.  Patients with mild hyperglycemia can develop a diabetic amyotrophy or lumbosacral plexopathy simply related to diabetes, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Speaking against this would be that her reflexes are intact at both knees at 2&#43; to 3 and slightly brisk, 1&#43; at both ankles and 1&#43; and symmetric in the upper extremities.  We will hold aspirin for today.  Consider LP for tomorrow, but have not ordered as we will try to avoid and hopefully the imaging studies I have ordered will be sufficient.

They put me in ambulance, covered me, gave me oxygen,  and fluids via iv. Blood pressure was 189/115, heart rate was 40.  Dr said I was very flushed. I was having difficult time breathing.   Oh, they gave me benadryl and I believe? steroids.  Had to wait for another ambulance as the one there had to stay onsite. I was taken to emergency room at hospital where I stayed on oxygen and new iv of steroids. Was at hospital for 4 hrs till bp was considered safe enough to release me.   I still have head ache and neck pain, back of neck.  Also sleeping much more than usual.6  Before getting shot I had asked the person giving shot if my allergies to penicillin and morphine would prevent my getting shot.  I had listed these on the paperwork necessary to getting shot.  She said they were looking for reactions to like the flu shot.

                                                On 1-27-21 my mother received her first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (031L2A). The next day she felt something in the back of her left knee. The following day (2 days) after the injection she saw her primary care physician for the discomfort in the back of her knee. She was treated for what was believed to be a soft tissue injury. She received her second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 (14M20A) vaccine on Friday 2-26-21. The next day the back of her knee started to bother her again. She saw her doctor on Monday3-1-21 and had an x-ray. On Tuesday the doctor&#39;s office called and said her x-ray  was clear. Friday morning, 3-5-21 my father heard a loud noise (thud) and  found my mother unresponsive on the bathroom floor at approximately 8:30am. He called 911. She was transported to the hospital via ambulance. The emergency room physicians worked on her for over an hour and were unable to get her back. Her time of death was 10:12am. The primary cause of death listed on her death certificate is pulmonary embolism.

                                                3 hours after receiving injection, I had severe diarrhea.  Into the night I began vomiting (which lasted all night)  I became feverish, had chills with body shaking, extreme nausea. (temp 102) This persisted to the next day and I went to the ER.  There I was given  multiple liters of IV fluids,  IV Zofran and IV Tylenol.   I felt better after treatment but still had the intense headache and ringing in the ears.  The next day, I&#39;m now gradually beginning to feel better, just weak.  I can eat today, two days after the injection and slowly beginning to feel better.   This reaction was terrible for me.

Soreness went away and injection site could not be found. 5 days after the shot was administered,, my arm started getting sore and I felt achy.  The 6th day, symptoms got worse, achy and chills, but no fever that I am aware of.  7th day, symptoms persisted but not as bad, except that my arm had swollen up and turned red all the way to my elbow and felt  like a large hard knot.  Today, I am not as achy or chilled, but my arm is still hot, red, and swollen .  The redness is below the injection site, although the injections site looks like a little red pimple, whereas earlier, I couldn&#39;t even find it.

Had a sore arm for one day, no redness, or swelling.

On the evening of the 9th day my are seemed tender to the touch and when I looked, it was red and started to swell at the vaccination site and a few spots below it. I sent my doctor a picture and he prescribed Cephalexin 500mg on January 25 in case it was an infection.  My arm is no longer tender but it&#39;s still red and a bit swollen. It hasn&#39;t gotten any worse since yesterday.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 21 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 043L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Jan 2021, after vaccine administration, the patient experienced injection site reaction.  On 22 Jan 2021, she was feeling achy.   On 23 Jan 2021, she had nerve pain that felt like cutting on the back, legs, and arms.  On 24 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s muscles were weak and were not working or responsive on both sides.   On 25 Jan 2021, the patient could not control her left hand and weakness was more predominant on left side. The patient went to the doctor and was hospitalized with minor stroke for 24 hours. The patient stated that she was still experiencing terrible pain in neck and lower back.  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, minor stroke, weak muscles, nerve pain, injection site reaction, and achy, was unknown. The outcome of event, terrible pain in neck and lower back, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and evidence of a temporal association between mRNA-1273 use and the onset of injection site reaction and achy, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. There is limited information to asses causality for the events of injection site reaction, and achy.  Additional information has been requested.

                                                First vaccine digestive symptoms and minor aches; very sore left arm lasted 7 days; 2nd vaccine: 102 degree fever on next day; aches and pains all over; could barely get out of bed; inability to eat at all for 24 hours; digestive symptoms: gas, acid refulx, nausea; giant burps. By next day, very painful electric transitory pains (seconds) in core of my vascular formation in my upper left leg. This is a congenital defect that responds to estrogen, but also some medicines like synthroid, which I do not take after getting reaction with just 3 pills. Successfully moderated Hashimoto&#39;s with strict gluten-free and dairy-free diet. I have never experience such severe leg pain and massive swelling, still happening today. Th The only other time that I have experienced these short intermitent &#34;electric&#34; pains was during infertility treatment at age 40, more than 30 years ago. I suspect something in the adjuvant. I hope that this will exit my body because the sudden swelling and severe pain is not something I can endure. It barely beats dying from Covid-19. My quality of life is wrecked for the time being. I suspect that this vaccine has caused an autoimmune attack on my vascular malformation; that my T cells have gone beserk. I&#39;d be willing to have my antibodies against Covid checked and I&#39;ll bet I have more than average! The havoc for people with autoimmunity and Moderna vaccine is serious. I despair and hope that it won&#39;t have a lasting impact on my health. I will volunteer to be studied, but no more Moderna vaccine for me! I trusted the medical establishment and government and this has not worked out well!

                                                Received #1 dose as stated.  Next day, 1/27/21, 9:00am , had mild joint pain to both legs, &amp; arms, &amp; slightly tired.  Shortly after that , while driving, had nausea, &amp; muscle aches to legs &amp; arms.  Reaching family members home, could barely carry bags with each arm, due to pain in joints, and to muscles, getting worse.  Through the next 6 hrs. had moderate to severe pain to joints, &amp; muscles &amp; gradually severe fatigue. Took 1 Tylenol 650 mg for pain.   Also, checked temperature thru out this time, with only mild 99.5 temp.  Vaccine site gradually became swollen, with increased pain.  Was doing work on computer, but could not continue, so left for my home, &amp; went to bed, to sleep.  Lt.  Arm started becoming red, with severe soreness &amp; swelling by 1/28/21, 2 days after vaccine.  Vaccine was given very high on my arm, almost shoulder area.  All Symptoms continued for about 10 days, including  to vaccine arm, which continued with redness &amp; soreness for 2 weeks.   My physician was notified.   She advised NSAID before #2 dose, but I already take NSAID daily (Meloxicam), so don&#39;t think I can take another NSAID.  I have been taking Tylenol 650mg at least twice a day, for increased joint &amp; muscle pain, since vaccine.  My 2nd dose, originally scheduled for 2/23/21 has been rescheduled to 2/27/21 due to no vaccines available.

I was also so fatigued that I could do nothing all day except lay on the couch or in bed. I felt better that night around 8 PM.

                                                On 01/11/2021, within a few hours of my grandmother getting the shot her injection area became red, swollen and hot to the touch. At around midnight the day her shot she started to experience tingling on both sides of my tounge. She an unusually restless night and on 1/12/2021 woke up feeling very tired and over all worn down.  Around 10:45a my I called to check on her she said she had just checked her temp and it was 99.6.  She was complaining of being very cold and had the shivers.  While on the phone she started to develop a stutter. At first it was one word every 14-20 word but it quickly got worse to the point where she couldn&#39;t get a full  word out and just sounds. I immediately left work and went to her house. On my way we contacted 911.  It took me about 10 mins to get to her house and when I got there she was semi- unresponsive on the couch making moaning noises and shaking. She was having severe muscle spasms throughout her body. You could see her muscles tighten and release. EMS got there within a few minutes after me. They checked her temp and it had increased to 101.00 she was a bit responsive and they were able to take her vitals however, it was difficult due to her shaking and convulsing. They transported her to the hospital and by they time they arrived (within 15 mins) her temp was then 102.6. She was still shaking, not lucid and stuttering her words. They hospital ran several tests to rule out stroke and other possible reasons for her symptoms- they said she had to be having a delayed reaction to the shot. She was extremely dehydrated, they hooked her up to an IV, she had an extremely elevated white blood count and was overall &#34;out of it&#34;. She was given IV antibiotics and observed.

Itchy rash lighter in color, but remains today as I file this. Not concerned about it. Am sure it will go away soon.

Saw my primary and she said it could be they gave it too high and irritated the shoulder joint.  She is concerned about &#34;frozen shoulder&#34;.  It wakes me in the night and no position lasts without pain after 30-45 seconds.  Take one extra strength Tylenol before bed and administer Sagely 250 mg. BD cream on upper arm and part of neck where pain exits.  Last night I drank 3 glasses of red wine so I could sleep a few hours and today I have had no pain!   little weakness and I&#39;m trying not to aggravate it, but hopefully the site pain is resolving.

                                                Initial site reaction was sore upper arm, no initial redness or other issues. General slight body aches and pains over the next 24 hours with no issues. No additional problems until on approximately Day 9 (Saturday after the immunization), the left arm became erythematous from approximately the vaccination site to almost the elbow.  This erythema was approximately three inches wide and the skin was raised slightly. Area was slightly itchy, not painful, and was warm to the touch. Erythema increased over the next 3 days and I sent a picture to my primary care physician. He advised a Medrol dose pack and Keflex. I requested that I be able to start the Keflex but hold off on the Medrol dose pack for a couple of days. He suggested Benadryl q 6 hours. I sent pictures each day. Two days later, there was some improvement but the provider did not feel there was enough improvement and he encouraged me to start the Medrol dose pack. I started the dose pack on Day 14 (Thursday) around 2 p.m. By 9:00 p.m. on the same day, there was considerable improvement in the look of the arm and the skin was only slightly raised. At the time of this report on Day 18, Monday 01/25/2021, I will finish the Medrol dose pack tomorrow. There is a shadow of where the erythema was and there is no raised skin.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                #1. I received the Moderna vaccine on 1/18/2021 in my right upper arm. On that Monday I experienced a small ache and redness at the injection site. On Tuesday 1/19 I had flu like symptoms, more pain at the injection site and a larger and firmer area at the injection site. Wed. 1/20 flu like symptoms were gone, but my upper arm was very sore in movement and by touch, was very red and swelling occurred. Thurs. 1/21 my upper arm was still painful to touch and swollen. Friday 1/22 a little less sore, still very red and itchy. Saturday 1/23 only slight discomfort, but very itchy. 1/24 Through 1/27 still very dark pink, still some swelling and intensely itchy. There was something hard protruding from the injection site, On 1/25 we tried to pull it out but it broke off and we dropped it before we could examine it. There is still a small amount of whatever it was protruding from the injection site. My next dose is supposed to be given on 2/15/2021, but I am very anxious about receiving it. I have reached out in an email dated 1/25/2021 but no response so far. My husband has an appointment with a dermatologist today 1/27/2021 and I am going to ask the Dr. to look at my arm.

I called my primary care physician but no one returned my call.   Awoke around 2:21 am, I am moist, my fever had broken.  Feeling much better.  During this period I experienced intense anger which was troubling.  I though I had been given the virus rather than the vaccine.  I am experiencing a much better mood this morning.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

                                                At about 2 pm, 2-19-2021, I became very light-headed rather suddenly, and could barely stand up or walk.  (A trip from my bed to the bathroom was difficult.)  This proceeded to severe nausea (I retched into the. toilet bowl a couple of times and came close to vomiting).  I dosed in bed and the severity of the symptoms eased, but I really haven&#39;t felt completely over it until today (2-22-2021).

                                                On Sat morning upon arising and taking a shower I noticed a red line almost welt on my arm by afternoon there were 2 lines and they were getting longer and wider. By Monday morning the area covered with puffiness and redness was about  at least 4 inches wide and going  almost entirely around the arm. It hurt and was very warm to touch along with starting to itch. It was not hard at the\at time. Placed a call to my doctor and was advised to see him or urgent care. I choose the later to do. In checking it out they mentioned that they have been seeing the quite often in the last couple weeks. Take an aspirin, tylenol or ibuprophn  and put cold conpresses on for 20 minutes as often as I can. This morning (Tuesday 23rd of February) it has enlarged again some redness is gone but it apprears to be black and blue now. Still itching, I have not itched it as of yet.

She states that her symptoms 1st started out as a slight postnasal drip, which turned into a hoarse voice with a cough, which turned into a head cold, which has turned in due shortness of breath, diarrhea, and cough with associated chills. After 17 days of cold-like symptoms, pt was tested on 2/26 for COVID and tested positive. 2/27, pt worsened and presented to ED. Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient&#39;s temperature is 100.2° F, heart rate 96, respiratory rate 24, saturating 84% on room air with blood pressure 164/84.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were significant for BUN 17, CR 1.47, lactate 2.2, D-dimer 6.79, and phosphorus 2.2.  The patient&#39;s chest x-ray showed no acute findings.  CT chest showed extensive acute bilateral pulmonary emboli involving most of the lobar and segmental branches, right greater than left with no saddle embolus.  Findings borderline for right heart strain, correlate with echocardiogram.  Peripheral ground-glass airspace opacities consistent with atypical/viral pneumonitis.  Reactive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 93 with inferior infarct-age undetermined.  The patient was administered 1 L IV NS, ceftriaxone 1 g IV, azithromycin 500 mg IV, and heparin IV bolus and drip for PE indication. Remdesivir started.  2/28/21: Pt on 3 L oxygen. Azithromycin, ceftriaxone, remdesivir continued. Vancomycin started.  3/1/21: 1 L oxygen via nasal cannula. Small, nonproductive cough. Pt complains of SOB.  3/2/21: 1/2 blood cultures from 2/27 positive for CoNS. Vancomycin discontinued. Pt feeling much better. Still on 1 L oxygen via nasal cannula. More alert.  3/3: 5 day remdesivir course and azithromycin, ceftriaxone course completed. Patient weaned off oxygen. Pt discharged home with oxygen as a precaution.

On the night of 13 Feb 20212, the patient experienced arm hurt a little bit and she felt fatigued.  In the early morning of 14 Feb 2021, the patient went to the bathroom.  On her way to the bathroom,  she felt confused and had overwhelming nausea.  She lost consciousness and banged her head on the cabinet.  Within second, she regained consciousness but felt extremely weak.  She could not recall how she got back to her bed.  The patient said she was cold and clammy at that time and she never got back to sleep.  During the day on 14 Feb 2021, the patient felt a throbbing pain on the arm where she got the injection.  She was not sure whether that was due to the injection or due to her fall when she lost consciousness.  She could barely move the arm.  Then she took a nap in the afternoon and was able to recover from her lack of sleep that night.    Treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown (although her doctor advised her not to get the second dose given the reaction she had).  The outcome of the events was resolved on 15 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Additional information has been requested.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded

I left the waiting room at 11:55.  One hour later, I had an extremely dry mouth &amp; needed water.  It resolved after drinking a bottle of water.  At 4:30pm I started itching in my hands, feet, &amp; entire body - itchiness was like prickles, not normal itching.  Took Claritin which kept itching under control.  I have taken Claritin 10mg daily for the last 5 days to keep itching under control. Today I am more itchy than yesterday.

I went to clinic to get tested for covid19 as I thought I was getting the virus again. I felt very much like I did in November when I tested positive &amp; had Covid symptoms for 2 weeks. I was sick but no breathing issues so did not go to hospital.

                                                My left arm was sore a couple of hours after the injection. It continued to get worse throughout the day. That night had a hard time sleeping as it was painful and kept waking me up. I believed it would just get better on its own. It is now 2 days after the vaccine and again another restless night of pain. It is not getting better but seems to be moving down my arm. The injection was at the top of my shoulder, it is uncomfortable about 3 inches down my arm. I broke my shoulder In April of 2019,  It feels just like that  as I try to move my arm around.

These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

Started feeling sick during the night, knew something was wrong.  Could barely get out of bed, was hot, possibly low grade fever, had chills, was achy, bad headache like you feel when having the flu, weakness.   Took Tylenol and her regular medicines.  Today, 1/29/21 when she woke up still has extreme soreness, hot to touch.  She looked at her left arm and it&#39;s all swollen, red and itchy.  She&#39;s now afraid to go back for the 2nd vaccine.   Caller her pharmacy due to her arm and she was instructed to take Benadryl and Ibuprofen, which she only takes Tylenol.

The patient&#39;s medical history included back problems with osteoarthritis in the spinal column neck and lower back. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included celecoxib and nortriptyline.   On 20 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 028L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 21 Jan 2021, the patient reported she got very dizzy and passed out. Her husband relays that she was totally out for a couple of seconds. She went to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a vasovagal reaction and urinary tract infection. Premature ventricular contractions were also discovered and was not known prior to this event. Patient reports a normal blood pressure of 114-120/75. Patient also stated her arm was sore the day after vaccine but not hurting much during her usual four mile walk.   Treatment for the event included intravenous medications in the emergency room, cephalexin, and a heart monitor.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events passed out, dizziness, vasovagal reaction and arm pain were resolved. The outcome of the events, urinary tract infection and premature ventricular contractions were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 74 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of dizziness, passed out, vasovagal reaction, urinary tract infection, premature ventricular contractions and arm pain.  The events occurred the next day after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current limited available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.  Further information have been requested.

                                                74 yo woman living in a group home for people with developmental disabilities. She has longstanding difficult-to-control seizure disorder, on valproate, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam. She had asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in November 2020, probably discovered in the course of surveillance testing of residents/staff, perhaps in relation to an outbreak in the residence.  Sometime during the night following her vaccination earlier that morning, she developed a fever, and then was found to be having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Estimates of duration in the records range from 20 to 40 minutes. She was brought by ambulance to Hospital ED, and then admitted. Her temperature was said to be 103 F.  She received midazolam, and at least one dose of IV antibiotics. By the evening of admission on 5 February 2021, she was still unresponsive.  On arrival, her COVID-19 PCR was again/still positive. She had no prodromal symptoms suggesting COVID-19 reinfection, nor did anyone in the group home, staff or residents.  Her initial WBC was normal but with a slight left shift. UA was normal. Head CT showed her known cerebral atrophy and chronic microvascular disease.  Admitting valproate serum level was subtherapeutic; levatiracetam and lamotrigine levels were therapeutic.  Blood cultures are no growth at 2 days. Urine culture negative.  By hospital day 2, her transaminases had bumped to over 1000.

                                                First Vaccine, no side effects except sore arm for one day and a lot of bruising at injection site which left in 8 days. Vaccine 2 awakened at 2:00 AM in extraordinary pain in my whole body,, dry heaved for 4 hours, sweats and chills, temp only 99 (I usually run 97) Felt sick to stomach rest of  day. Never felt this sick.  By evening it left as quickly as it came.  Was tired for several days but nothing else. On Feb 16th awakened with an very sharp pain in the injection site when I moved my arm up to stretch. This has gotten worse every day. When I move my arm in a certain direction it feels like it is ripping inside. It is not bruised and not painful to the touch. It is inside and in the same location as the injection. Heat and ice make no difference. It seems to be getting more painful and feel it more often. It is painful enough that I let out a yelp when I forget and lift my arm a certain way. As of yesterday I feel it all day, not the sharp pain but more a inside burning, not enough to stop me, but I know it os there.

Pain/nausea elevated BP and decreased food intake which caused low blood sodium levels. IV treatments to increase sodium and lower BP. Dizziness from low sodium and high BP created fall risk, so bed had alarm.  Bed confinement necessitated daily injections to prevent blood clots.  Twice daily blood tests done to monitor sodium and potassium levels &#43; kidney function.

Her husband reported that she was well until the evening following her vaccination (1/08/2021) at which time she became agitated.  The following day she became very fatigued and unresponsive, taking only sips of water.  The only medical attention they sought at this time was a home health hospice nurse as the patient had been on hospice.  Her condition spontaneously improved without treatment after 3 days and 6 days after her vaccination she was at her normal baseline.

                                                After receiving vaccine patient started to feel hot and face turning red. She reported feeling like she was tight in the chest and throat was swelling. She said she had an epi pen with her. I asked her if she thought it was time to administer and call 911 she said yes. We proceeded. She said her throat was feeling a little better but chest was tight and she was having a dry cough. Ambulance took her to hospital. I called her around Noon the next day to check in on her and she said she was in hospital still being monitored. Was advised not to get second dose of vaccine from hospital.

                                                After the shot, I went home and felt fine.  I did some housework (cleaning) for about thirty minutes, then sat to rest .  Shortly thereafter, I began feeling pain in my left arm.  The pain became more severe as the day progressed until it was very severe and movement of my arm was limited.  The pain progressed throughout the night and also moved into my shoulder.  I got very little sleep even after taking Tylenol and trying heat and  ice applications.  Now, on the third day I am still having pain and am unable to lift my arm or move it outward without severe pain.  I am definitely hindered in my movement and use of left arm.  This is disturbing as I am an artist and need both arms to do my work.

Blood pressure rose to 170-190 over 110 and would not go down.  Doctor advised I go to the E.R. for assessment, which I did. Blood pressure remained elevated for days . Noted the systolic was higher , mostly in the 80&#39;s.  I do not have hypertension BP this morning  in the 120&#39;s over 70.  Needed Alprazolam to calm my anxiety since.  Not every day. Very concerned about having the second dose. Doctor has advised me to only drink water the day of shot, take a tranquilizer an hour before and has given me BP med to take if my BP goes over 150.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I had my first dose of the Moderna Vaccine 1/14 with minor discomfort. On 1/21 area around the site felt itchy. On 1/22 morning I saw large red circle that was slightly sore and hot to the touch. On 1/22 afternoon I called for appointment.  Since none was available I went to urgent care where I was prescribed Doxycycline.  Have been taking it as prescribed and circle has been slowly fading away but is still visible.  I  thought it might have been a reaction to an insect bite, but now a friend who got the vaccine the same day I did is experiencing the same reaction.   I  would like to know if you think this is connected to the vaccine and if so could it affect the efficacy of the vaccine? I am also concerned about taking the second dose.

On Monday,  1/25/21, I contacted my primary care doctor.

Headache continued for three days during which no medical attention was sought. Confirmed that patient never took any NSAIDs to treat headache during this time. On day 4, patient had a subdural hematoma accompanied by two seizures upon which she was flown to a hospital to receive treatment.  Husband did state that patient is on warfarin due to factor V deficiency and that treating physician thought that this was most likely caused by the warfarin, however that the vaccine could not be ruled out completely. Husband also said INR has always been within normal limits.

                                                Woke up about 1:00 am in delirium and feverish. No control over thought process or able to get up. Managed to get out of bed at 9:00 am but was so weak could barely make it up a flight of stairs. And when I did ended up in bathroom vomiting. Laid on floor to get some strength back. Went back to bed and slept restlessly until 4:00 pm.  Still feverish and weak but not as bad as earlier. Ate some cold grapes and went back to bed until the following morning. Tried to stay hydrated and took ibuprofen several times. My upper arm was red and blotchy for 3 days. Overall I?d say the severest part of the event lasted 48 hrs and another 24 hrs of tiredness and nausea but not vomiting.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine she felt a tingling/little something going down into her hand, but she did not think about it being the shot and did not report it.  Then went home, took a Tylenol and that afternoon her arm was sore like the normal reaction.  She went to bed, woke up at 1:00 AM and her arm was killing her/hurting.  She got up and went to the bathroom and noticed that her hand was swollen and the veins on the top of her hand were protruding.  She looked in the mirror and noticed that the left side of her neck was swollen.  Then she took her temperature and it was elevated, her normal is 97 and it was 99.  Later on that day on Saturday the inflammation got better.  She did not take anything for it.   The symptoms have progressively gotten better and now her hand is normal, her neck this morning looked normal and her temperature is back to her baseline.
