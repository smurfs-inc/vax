                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

He subsequently developed fever, diarrhea, and vomiting.  The day prior to admission, he developed a diffuse popular rash.  He was seen in clinic on 5/20 and lab work was obtained, which was consistent with MIS-C findings (elevated troponin, elevated fibrinogen, elevated CRP, hyponatremia, relatively low absolute lymphocyte count).

A 12-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: unknown and Expire Date: unknown) on 22May2021 via unspecified route of administration as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. As medical history it was reported that, he had allergies and allergic to a lot of things, mold, feather dust and everything and dyspepsia. He had been taking Claritin for allergies (but not when he got the vaccine). She stated her son did not have any allergies to medications. Concomitant mediations were not reported. On 26May2021, 4 days after that he was complaining of chest pain. Caller wants to know if her son should get the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Caller stated, &#34;He had other symptoms. On Tuesday the chest pain went away then complained again on Thursday. His doctor gave him an EKG and his heart rate was fine. Caller did not take him to the ER at the time because did not want a medical bill. His blood sugar spiked up. He had sweating, vomiting, diarrhea. He said he had &#34;sharp pain in my chest and never felt that before&#34; His blood sugar spiked up. He was dehydrated. He had ketones from it. Caller gave him extra insulin. He had chest pain from the vaccine. It was on Tuesday and happened again on Thursday but had not come back since then. It subsided. EKG was ok.&#34; No one was informed (doctors). I took him to the regular doctor. She did not know. She was not aware of the symptoms. They are not specialized in the medications they are giving. It was hard to give them any kind of referral. Both of us had vomiting, headaches and chills. He had never had chest pains from any vaccines. He had fatigue, these are symptoms form the covid shot. It was 4 days and then 6 days after the vaccine. A fast heartbeat. HCP are not going to help. If they are dosing the covid shots but they are not given the vaccines they did not want to do anything. There was no accountability. Caller having a hard time. No one can give me an answer, no one. Not from the experts, no one was telling me. The vaccine administration should have been through the doctors, they will not take your data without understanding the vaccines. All the kids 12 and up and all male and like my son and probably a lot more but they are not saying it. Caller scared. My son did not have a heart defect. Caller did not know. Heart inflammation; they need to know if it was safe or not. It was scary to know no one knows what was going on or not. Caller asked about myocarditis. The patient had heart burn before but said the chest pain was not that. With the symptoms the caller saw online, she thinks the patient had pericarditis. The patient&#39;s next dose was on 12Jun2021.The caller was reading online that people reported chest pain and ended up in the emergency room and the caller did not want that. All the events occurred on an unspecified date in May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood glucose increased: spiked up on May2021, electrocardiogram: fine on 25May2021 EKG and his heart rate was fine, heart rate increased: fast on 25May2021. The outcome of event chest pain was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of dehydrated. The outcome of blood sugar spiked up, sweating, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, felt sick, extreme fatigue, and slept on and off for about 4 days, dehydration, fast heartbeat and pericarditis was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Felt tired that night and into the next day with some local swelling and pain to the right arm at site of injection, and also into right armpit. Thursday evening, he was resting sitting on the couch and developed some mild chest pain. Can&#39;t really describe the location or severity very well. Did seem to be worse with inspiration. Hasn&#39;t reoccurred since that time. Still feels somewhat tired today with mildly sore right arm. No fevers. No chest pain today.    IR showed second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine was given to the left arm but confirmed with CVS that it was given to the right arm.

He turned pale, felt like he was going to throw up. But never did. A few minutes later he started to get a little color back in his face. He is tired but was better.

                                                Pt received first shot of Pfizer vaccine on 5/14 - 12:30 PM EST. On 05/17 around 7:45 AM, Pt passed out/fainted. He woke up few minutes prior to the event and this event started after he passed urine. As soon as he finished Urination, he felt nauseated, dizzy and then lost consciousness thereafter. He fell backwards as a result and hurt his back as well as back side of the head. During his unconsciousness  his body was completely stiff and his eyes were rolled back. For few seconds then he became completely still (it felt he was not breathing). I gave him physical stimulus (slight slaps on the face) post which he started reviving. During this time we called 911. I gave him few sips of water forcibly and he started reviving thereafter. on 5/15 and 5/16 (post vaccination on 5/14) he was feeling tired and seemed bit dull. This was unusual as Pt is a competitive soccer player and highly active.

After a little while, he got up and was able to take some Tylenol and attend his video school day with frequent breaks. In afternoon, he started to feel worse. 102. 6 fever - we called Tele-doc appt. His throat was sore and he had some chest pain. The doctor recommended that we go to ER to have him fully evaluated. Pain and fever got better with the Tylenol. He took another couple of dose. Next morning, he had a lot better but continued to have a low fever 100.2 - on and off that day. His lymph nodes under his left arm were quite swollen and painful. The fever did not continue yesterday but the swelling has and the pain has. He was very light-headed and brain fogged on Sunday and Monday. Seems to be better today - the lymph nodes have gone down a lot but are still swollen today. He is  in process of recovering.

                                                At approximately 6 PM on 05/23/2021, family was sitting down for dinner when all of a sudden she noticed that he was turning his head to the left and appeared to be falling out of his chair.  Mom states that eyes were darting back and forth at this time.  He was not responding to her shouting his name and his left arm was curled in towards his body with the rest of his body remaining stiff.  This lasted approximately 1 minute, followed by a time of confusion and drowsiness.  Approximately 1 minute later mom states that patient&#39;s eyes rolled back to his head and he had full body movement consistent with tonic-clonic seizures.  Family were able to lay him onto the ground during this time.  Mom denies any color change, apnea, or loss of bowel or bladder.  States he did have one episode of emesis following the event, and 2 episodes of emesis in the ambulance on the way to ED.  Patient has no previous history of seizures or seizure-like activity.  No new ingestions.  Has not been sick recently and denies any new sick contacts.  There has been no head trauma.   Per Mom, patient&#39;s dad has a history of &#34;partial seizures&#34; but never required any medication for them.   At arrival to the ED he continued to be drowsy and not at his normal baseline.  Continue to hold his left wrist up toward his body in a contracted manner and tended to have repetitive speech.   Briefly, ER course significant for a CT head and evaluation by pediatric neurology.  CT head was unremarkable for acute intracranial process.  A CBC, CMP, and coags were also obtained due to patient&#39;s continued contracture positioning and the possibility of a stroke.  CMP was unremarkable with a sodium of 139, potassium of 3.7, chloride of 107, bicarb 25, BUN of 12 and creatinine of 0.64.  CBC was also unremarkable with WBC of 10.72, hemoglobin of 14.8, hematocrit of 44.4 and platelets of 370.  There was 81.77% neutrophils after evaluation by neurology it was felt that the patient remained postictal and recommended that he be admitted on continuous EEG and possible MRI in the a.m.

                                                Shortly after vaccine my son had extreme pain in his chest and heart area. It expanded to his shoulder and part of his neck and could not stand up. We took him to the local hospital and after examination they said the blood work and ekg was fine so they released him. We are at home now and he feels the pain still if he pauses his breath, and he just showed me you can hear a very strange sound coming from his heart as it beats. I can hear it sitting near him a loud pumping or squirting sound in there as his heart pumps! Never heard anything like that before coming from someone?s chest!
