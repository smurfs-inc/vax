                                                Patient received the vaccination.  Approximately 20 seconds after receiving the dose patient said &#34;I&#39;m going to faint&#39;.  Patient appeared to  faint but also appeared to be having a seizure.  The patients legs appeared to go rigid and he make movements with his arms. He appeared very pale.  The patient &#34;came to&#34; within approximately a minute?  Patients mother and I were able to lay Patient down on the floor. I asked his mother if she would like us to call 911 and she said yes.  Prior to the incident, I discussed Patients past history of seizures with his mother. She sail he had seizures when he was younger and had been on medication, but he was no longer on any medication and had been seizure free for approximately 5 years.

                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

He subsequently developed fever, diarrhea, and vomiting.  The day prior to admission, he developed a diffuse popular rash.  He was seen in clinic on 5/20 and lab work was obtained, which was consistent with MIS-C findings (elevated troponin, elevated fibrinogen, elevated CRP, hyponatremia, relatively low absolute lymphocyte count).

A 12-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: unknown and Expire Date: unknown) on 22May2021 via unspecified route of administration as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. As medical history it was reported that, he had allergies and allergic to a lot of things, mold, feather dust and everything and dyspepsia. He had been taking Claritin for allergies (but not when he got the vaccine). She stated her son did not have any allergies to medications. Concomitant mediations were not reported. On 26May2021, 4 days after that he was complaining of chest pain. Caller wants to know if her son should get the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Caller stated, &#34;He had other symptoms. On Tuesday the chest pain went away then complained again on Thursday. His doctor gave him an EKG and his heart rate was fine. Caller did not take him to the ER at the time because did not want a medical bill. His blood sugar spiked up. He had sweating, vomiting, diarrhea. He said he had &#34;sharp pain in my chest and never felt that before&#34; His blood sugar spiked up. He was dehydrated. He had ketones from it. Caller gave him extra insulin. He had chest pain from the vaccine. It was on Tuesday and happened again on Thursday but had not come back since then. It subsided. EKG was ok.&#34; No one was informed (doctors). I took him to the regular doctor. She did not know. She was not aware of the symptoms. They are not specialized in the medications they are giving. It was hard to give them any kind of referral. Both of us had vomiting, headaches and chills. He had never had chest pains from any vaccines. He had fatigue, these are symptoms form the covid shot. It was 4 days and then 6 days after the vaccine. A fast heartbeat. HCP are not going to help. If they are dosing the covid shots but they are not given the vaccines they did not want to do anything. There was no accountability. Caller having a hard time. No one can give me an answer, no one. Not from the experts, no one was telling me. The vaccine administration should have been through the doctors, they will not take your data without understanding the vaccines. All the kids 12 and up and all male and like my son and probably a lot more but they are not saying it. Caller scared. My son did not have a heart defect. Caller did not know. Heart inflammation; they need to know if it was safe or not. It was scary to know no one knows what was going on or not. Caller asked about myocarditis. The patient had heart burn before but said the chest pain was not that. With the symptoms the caller saw online, she thinks the patient had pericarditis. The patient&#39;s next dose was on 12Jun2021.The caller was reading online that people reported chest pain and ended up in the emergency room and the caller did not want that. All the events occurred on an unspecified date in May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood glucose increased: spiked up on May2021, electrocardiogram: fine on 25May2021 EKG and his heart rate was fine, heart rate increased: fast on 25May2021. The outcome of event chest pain was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of dehydrated. The outcome of blood sugar spiked up, sweating, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, felt sick, extreme fatigue, and slept on and off for about 4 days, dehydration, fast heartbeat and pericarditis was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

A 12-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/Lot number and expiration date: not reported), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 19May2021 (at the age of 12-years-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included covid-19 on an unknown date in Oct 2020, allergy to animal (cats) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and AE(s) following prior vaccinations was none. Patient&#39;s mother mentioned that day after his shot, he experienced fever and diarrhea (on 20May2021) which lasted for 7 days. Caller states the fever was more like 8 days and the diarrhea was at least 8 days, she would have to ask him when it completely went away. Caller states her son lost 5 pounds (on 20May2021) when he got sick on an unspecified date, he was 90 pounds currently, he was 95 when he got the vaccine. She states he kept losing weight over the week. Caller states his stool was green and he was pooping everything out, it was gross on an unspecified date.  On the 2nd day, he experienced vomiting (on 21May2021). He was also tired for a long time on an unspecified date. Caller states her son had been staying at his dad&#39;s house when he was sick. She states she would&#39;ve taken him to be seen earlier because after 5 days of fever, he needed an IGG drip in case it was his heart or similar to Kawasaki. She requested him to get an IgG Drip because, according to her, any child who has a fever for 7 days might have the virus that causes Kawasaki disease. This is based on her experience with her daughter who has Kawasaki disease. The son was not given the IgG drip because the doctors were not sure. They also tested his stool, but he did not have anything wrong. She mentioned that her son had COVID in October, the one that got sick for a week, then goes away, and comes back again. He was sick for a while with all the symptoms, and it was proven that he had it. Caller states when he got sick, they wanted to rule other things out, so they tested his feces for a bunch of things, but he was negative for everything. As of calling, the son had recovered but she was requesting for him to have an ultrasound of the heart. She was asking if he should get the 2nd dose. The events resulted in physician office visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included culture stool negative on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever, lost weight was recovered on 28May2021; vomiting recovered on 21May2021; diarrhea, fatigue recovered on an unspecified date; and the outcome was unknown for faeces discoloured and illness.

A 12-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8729; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, in left arm on 27May2021 (at the age of 12-years-old) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included patient had an allergic reaction to penicillin before. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had a meningitis vaccine a month before the covid vaccine. Patient&#39;s mother was calling on behalf of her 12 year old son. She stated her son received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 27May2021. On 27May2021,6 hours after receiving the vaccine the patient said he was very itchy and had hives on the left side of his chest. At first she thought the patient had poison ivy because it was like 3-4 inches across. The next day the patient said he was itchy when he sat up and it went up onto his neck and cheeks and that&#39;s when she realized it was hives. She called the doctor, applied cold compresses to the patient and gave him Benadryl. The hives resolved very quickly, the patient has never had hives or an allergic reaction before. By 2:30 the patient had the Benadryl and you couldn&#39;t see the red anymore. The patient could sit up but kept saying it itched and that went on for about 48 hours. You would have to look pretty closely to see the bumps. One week after the patient received the vaccine he was really weak and tired (on 03Jun2021). She stated her son also keeps having episodes of tiredness and weakness. It felt like the patient had been exercising and his legs were tired and his head felt like it was burning (on 03Jun2021). The patient&#39;s temperature was 97.7. The patient laid down and he slept pretty hard, and was drooling, for a couple of hours. When the patient woke up he didn&#39;t know where he was, the time or date and within a couple of hours the patient was fine. She didn&#39;t think anything of it the first time it happened. This event happened again 2 weeks after the vaccine. The doctor said they symptoms sound like mono but the patient&#39;s lymph nodes aren&#39;t swollen and he doesn&#39;t have a sore throat. The doctor thought the patient was having a delayed immune response to the vaccine because of the timing of it. The doctor said that by 3 weeks this should have resolved. The patient has had 2 mild episodes of this since, but he didn&#39;t go to sleep he just laid down. The doctor said to wait to get the second dose, so now it is 4 weeks since the first vaccine. The patient was at the 30th percentile for his height and average for his weight. The patient had gained weight since the vaccine but his mother didn&#39;t know if that was related to the vaccine. She was afraid of the patient having myocarditis with the second dose. The patient went to sleep after taking the Benadryl last time and she was afraid that the patient won&#39;t be able to tell her if he was having chest pain or problems breathing. She stated if his reaction was just hives she would give him Benadryl but with the risk of myocarditis after being given Benadryl he wouldn&#39;t be alert enough to tell her if something was going on with his heart due to him having fatigue as well already. The redness went away within 24 hours and the itching was gone in 48-72 hours. The redness was gone the evening of the 28th. The patient could still see and feel the bumps, the bumps were just white. The patient&#39;s head was burning happened the first 2 times he had these events. The patient&#39;s temperature was 97.7 and 98.1 fahrenheit when this happened. The other two times the patient said his head burned between his eyes and not like a headache. The doctor said that if the fatigue symptom continued he would recommend doing some blood work but since it has gotten better his mother may take him to an allergist. She thinks that the patient may be allergic to something in the vaccine. she was thinking of taking him to an allergist to see if he was allergic to one of the ingredients in the vaccine. She stated from the list of the ingredients the only ingredient she found that could be linked to the vaccine that could cause an allergic reaction would be PEG. She stated her son never had any allergies to medications or vaccines in the past. She stated she was not sure what advice should be given regarding her son receiving the second dose of the vaccine due to him having an allergic reaction to the first dose and tiredness and weakness. She stated she was not sure of the risks of vaccine versus him not being vaccinated. She would like to know if he should receive the second dose after experiencing side effects with the first dose. Reporter seriousness events was unspecified. Outcome of the events hives and itching recovered on May 2021, redness recovered on 28May2021, event tiredness and weakness was recovering and for other events was unknown.

This consumer reported for a 12-year-old male patient (grandson).   A 12-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 07Jul2021 11:30 (At the age of 12 year old) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Caller called on behalf of his grandson (12-year-old) who received the first dose of the Pfizer Biontech COVID-19 vaccine and on the same day he got the shot, he experienced headache, neck ache, fever, and throwing up on 07Jul2021. Stated that the headache gets better and comes better. Stated that it was tolerable and comes back. Stated that the fever comes and goes. Started throwing up 2-3 days ago. She wanted to know if those side effects were related to the COVID19 vaccine and if she needed to go to the doctor and if he could get the second dose. Caller also stated that the side effects outweigh the COVID shot, I do not want my grandchild to suffer like that. Vaccines were supposed to make you feel better, not sick. Caller asked if the vaccine was tested on children and if they had side effects. Wanted to know if she needed to go the doctor because he cannot live throwing up all the time. Stated that he had never been sick before. Stated that he was only 12 years old. Does not think that vaccine was adequate for children. Therapeutic measures included Ibuprofen for his headache and fever. Stated that he had cold compresses for the neckache. Stated that he had ginger ale and Pepto Bismol for throwing up. Outcome of the event headache and throwing up was reported as not recovered at this time of the time. Outcome of the event neck ache was reported as recovered on 11Jul2021. Outcome of the event fever was reported as recovering and outcome of the event potential not to get the second shot was reported as Unknown.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

Felt tired that night and into the next day with some local swelling and pain to the right arm at site of injection, and also into right armpit. Thursday evening, he was resting sitting on the couch and developed some mild chest pain. Can&#39;t really describe the location or severity very well. Did seem to be worse with inspiration. Hasn&#39;t reoccurred since that time. Still feels somewhat tired today with mildly sore right arm. No fevers. No chest pain today.    IR showed second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine was given to the left arm but confirmed with CVS that it was given to the right arm.

                                                The day after the shot, June 9th, he had pain in his armpit and a bit on his left side.  Later in the day he felt a lump in his armpit (I am assuming lymph node).  It hurt to touch the lump and hurt any time he moved his arm.  Pain continued today, June 10th, and the lump under his arm is quite big at around 1.5 inches.  It is squishy to touch.  Painful to touch or move arm all day today as well.  No other symptoms (no fever, chills, etc).

They woke him up when he was sleeping and did not go away. Then, it continued through the next day and we asked our doctor if we needed to keep an eye on him because of all the reporting and stuff about the heart problems. They did a triage consult visit to see if it could be an adverse event from the vaccine. The course of action was to take 2 ibuprofen every 4 hours and use ice and heat to see if the pain improved to rule out musculoskeletal situations because that was what they thought it was. We did that for 2 days and then the pain moved to his back upper right quadrant and we noticed a rash all over his abdomen and we were not sure where he got that. Based on the fact that the pain moved the doctor was more confident that it was not an adverse event.

He woke up few minutes prior to the event and this event started after he passed urine. As soon as he finished Urination, he felt nauseated, dizzy and then lost consciousness thereafter. He fell backwards as a result and hurt his back as well as back side of the head. During his unconsciousness  his body was completely stiff and his eyes were rolled back. For few seconds then he became completely still (it felt he was not breathing). I gave him physical stimulus (slight slaps on the face) post which he started reviving. During this time we called 911. I gave him few sips of water forcibly and he started reviving thereafter. on 5/15 and 5/16 (post vaccination on 5/14) he was feeling tired and seemed bit dull. This was unusual as Pt is a competitive soccer player and highly active.

After a little while, he got up and was able to take some Tylenol and attend his video school day with frequent breaks. In afternoon, he started to feel worse. 102. 6 fever - we called Tele-doc appt. His throat was sore and he had some chest pain. The doctor recommended that we go to ER to have him fully evaluated. Pain and fever got better with the Tylenol. He took another couple of dose. Next morning, he had a lot better but continued to have a low fever 100.2 - on and off that day. His lymph nodes under his left arm were quite swollen and painful. The fever did not continue yesterday but the swelling has and the pain has. He was very light-headed and brain fogged on Sunday and Monday. Seems to be better today - the lymph nodes have gone down a lot but are still swollen today. He is  in process of recovering.

                                                This patient received their second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 6/4/2021.  The patient began experiencing arm pain which migrated to his chest on 6/6/2021.  The pain resolved but returned with increased severity on 6/7/2021, prompting medical evaluation.  The pain was described as a pressure sensation in the center of the chest and in bilateral arms.  Upon initial evaluation, he was found to have an abnormal EKG with ST segment changes.  Troponin was significantly elevated.  He was transferred to the hospital.  A transthoracic echo was obtained and was normal.  He was hospitalized on the pediatric cardiology service, admitted on 6/8/2021.  Troponin trended down during his stay. He was started on lisinopril.  He was discharged home on 6/9/2021 with plan for outpatient pediatric cardiology follow up.  Given the proximity of his second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to onset of his symptoms, and given similar reported events, the chief concern is whether his episode of myocarditis is related to administration of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  I was on call as attending physician when this patient was admitted.  Physician cared for this patient as the pediatric cardiology inpatient attending during his hospital course.

Initially after the vaccine he had some generalized fatigue and nausea but yesterday started experiencing some chest tightness lasting up to 4 minutes.  He also feels an irregular heart rate or like his heart is bounding.  He also had some generalized bilateral neck stiffness.  This is all resolved currently.  He did vomit 1 to 2 hours ago.  No fevers or chills.  No cough or cold symptoms. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with ST 1 box upsloping elevation V3 through V6.  Initial troponin is elevated at 2.6.  Attempted to consult  cardiologist  and they recommended pediatric cardiology consultation.  Spoke with Dr. .  She recommended admission with trending troponins and Motrin.  She says they typically do echocardiogram and if normal then cardiac MRI.  Spoke with Dr.  in the  ER and they graciously accept patient in transfer.

On 6/15, continued to have these symptoms then developed abdominal pain and vomited once.  Symptoms persisted on 6/16; then developed chest pain at 11:00PM and reported that pain seemed worse when inhaling and was sharp, shooting pain. Presented to ED at 12:00 AM on 6/17 and subsequently transferred to Pediatric ICU due to elevated troponin and d-dimer.  Initial EKG showed tachycardia. Cardiologist consulted. He had an echocardiogram on 6/17 AM that showed mildly depressed LV systolic function with EF ~58%. Troponin was elevated from 2.9 to 16.9. Due to echo and elevation in troponin patient received 100 gm IVIG (max dose based on  IBW). Has required one dose of 15 mg ketorolac IV and 650 mg acetaminophen PO x1 for chest pain. At 1:00 PM on 6/17, troponin increased to 54.6 and aspirin 81 mg started. Chest x-ray showed borderline cardiomegaly. On 6/18 repeat echocardiogram with normalized LVEF and considered a normal echocardiogram per cardiologist.

                                                After about 15 hours, my son was experiencing injection site pain, was feeling tired, had a mild headache, muscle pain (mostly in his legs), some mild chills, some joint pain, arm pain, feeling &#34;unwell&#34;, and was running a fever of approximately 100 degrees.  After 24 hours of rest, drinking water and  Gatorade, and three doses of over the counter Acetaminophen (one full adult dose followed by two half-doses) he awoke the next morning feeling much better.  He continues to do well as I am writing this, which is now 50 hours since the injection.

                                                At approximately 6 PM on 05/23/2021, family was sitting down for dinner when all of a sudden she noticed that he was turning his head to the left and appeared to be falling out of his chair.  Mom states that eyes were darting back and forth at this time.  He was not responding to her shouting his name and his left arm was curled in towards his body with the rest of his body remaining stiff.  This lasted approximately 1 minute, followed by a time of confusion and drowsiness.  Approximately 1 minute later mom states that patient&#39;s eyes rolled back to his head and he had full body movement consistent with tonic-clonic seizures.  Family were able to lay him onto the ground during this time.  Mom denies any color change, apnea, or loss of bowel or bladder.  States he did have one episode of emesis following the event, and 2 episodes of emesis in the ambulance on the way to ED.  Patient has no previous history of seizures or seizure-like activity.  No new ingestions.  Has not been sick recently and denies any new sick contacts.  There has been no head trauma.   Per Mom, patient&#39;s dad has a history of &#34;partial seizures&#34; but never required any medication for them.   At arrival to the ED he continued to be drowsy and not at his normal baseline.  Continue to hold his left wrist up toward his body in a contracted manner and tended to have repetitive speech.   Briefly, ER course significant for a CT head and evaluation by pediatric neurology.  CT head was unremarkable for acute intracranial process.  A CBC, CMP, and coags were also obtained due to patient&#39;s continued contracture positioning and the possibility of a stroke.  CMP was unremarkable with a sodium of 139, potassium of 3.7, chloride of 107, bicarb 25, BUN of 12 and creatinine of 0.64.  CBC was also unremarkable with WBC of 10.72, hemoglobin of 14.8, hematocrit of 44.4 and platelets of 370.  There was 81.77% neutrophils after evaluation by neurology it was felt that the patient remained postictal and recommended that he be admitted on continuous EEG and possible MRI in the a.m.

We took him to the local hospital and after examination they said the blood work and ekg was fine so they released him. We are at home now and he feels the pain still if he pauses his breath, and he just showed me you can hear a very strange sound coming from his heart as it beats. I can hear it sitting near him a loud pumping or squirting sound in there as his heart pumps! Never heard anything like that before coming from someone?s chest!

                                                My son developed neck soreness and and an enlarged lymph node that weekend.  On Monday following the vaccination a severe headache started which lasted 4 days, even with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Tuesday, he started complaining about not remembering what he did the day before when he woke up in the morning..memory started coming back around noon. The memory issues lasted one week and began to dissipate thankfully.  After a few weeks got a call to schedule his second shot.  Called the pediatrician and the pediatrician told us not to administer the second vaccine due to adverse reaction to the first.   We are monitoring his memory issues..he is almost a straight A student in school last year and on an Advanced Learning Plan in high school due to high IQ. We will know if this is long lasting after attending school and monitoring his grades and headaches in the fall.

                                                Starting from the night of the second day (i.e., June 10th), the patient feels chest pain. The pain also extends to neck and left shoulder. Deep breath aggravates the pain. The patient could not fall asleep. He had a light fever at the night of vaccination day but the fever was gone before the chest pain.  Single lead ECG with Watch has been measured and sent to a friend of the parents&#39; who is a physian, and no abnormal sign was shown from ECG. 400 mg Advil (ibuprofen) was given in the coming morning around 7 AM and the patient was able to fall asleep and symptons were gradually relieved. Another two doses of 200 mg Advil were given with six hours apart on the same day. The pain was gone by the following morning (i.e., June 11th) and no ibuprofen has been given afterwards. We suspect that this is related to myocarditis or pericarditis.  This was the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. There was no symptons for adverse effect after the first dose.

In the ER he reported 4 out of 10 chest pain and mild right temporal pain.  No nausea, no abdominal pain.  No shortness of breath.  .  In the ED vital signs were normal with a heart rate of 61 and normal blood pressure.  O2 sat was 98% in room air.  A troponin was done that was elevated at 1.96.  Chest x-ray was normal.  EKG showed sinus bradycardia otherwise normal EKG. he was given 600 mg of ibuprofen in the ED and he was evaluated by cardiology and since his symptoms were stable and patient was well-appearing and improved he was sent home on ibuprofen as needed.  Mom reports that by the next day he was back to normal and has not complained of pain, palpitations or shortness of breath or any other symptoms since then.  Denies feeling tired.  He has not allow him to have any sort of activity.

                                                15 yo M with no PMH p/w 1 day of chest pain and elevated troponin and lateral ST segment elevations.  On Wednesday 6/30 he had his second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. There after he had headache, tactile fever, fatigue and myalgias which resolved by Friday 7/2. On Friday at midnight, he awoke with 7/10 sharp substernal chest pain, non radiating. No recent trauma to the chest. He took Tylenol at home which did not relieve the pain.  No recent URI sx over the last month. The last time he remembers having URI sx was 1.5 years ago. He does endorse &#34;one or two sneezes&#34; over the past month, which he attributes to allergies.  Today 7/3, he presented to urgent care center where he got an EKG, which was concerning for ST elevations. He was given ASA which did not relieve the pain. He was sent to hospital for further work up where he had a Troponin to 1.59, CRP to 36, AST to 79, ALT to 64, Alkphos to 74, BNP to 119, ESR to 10, and WBC to 13.4.  EKG showed ST elevation in I, II, precordial leads V4 V5 V6. CXR wnl. He was given IV toradol at hospital, which alleviated his CP. He was transferred to ED for further evaluation.  On arrival to the ED on 7/3, he was HDS afebrile, with BP 111/69, HR of 80, and satting 100% on RA. His CP had resolved to a level of 0/10. Additional labs were obtained including repeat CBC (with WBC 10K, Hgb of 14), normal ESR of 20, normal D-dimer of less than 0.27, BMP wnl, elevated LFTs with AST 103, ALT of 61, elevated LDH to 293, normal GGT and alk phos, normal BNP to 28, elevated CRP to 3, and an extremely elevated troponin of 3.15. NP swab for COID, Influenza A/B, and RSV were negative. CXR wnl but did note findings consistent with degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV x 8 doses. His chest discomfort improved by day 2 of admission. An echocardiogram was performed which did not show any cardiac dysfunction. His troponin downtrended while on IV steroids, therefore he was transitioned over to PO steroids which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were continuing to trend down, and EKG was WNL. Cardiac MRI was performed and showed late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. He had occasional NSVTs/PVCs; he was started on Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily to prevent arrhythmias after discharge. He was discharged home with a Holter monitor to be worn for 4 days. Viral myocarditis studies were sent and all negative.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Patient will follow up in cardiology clinic next week with a repeat MRI 3-6 months.   Of note, CXR from 7/3 with incidental findings suspicious for degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine. This should be followed  by his primary care physician as an out patient.   Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  - Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily (for prevention of NSVT)  - Prednisone 30mg BID (myocarditis)  - Famotidine 20mg daily (while on steroids)  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued equipment: NA   Relevant Diagnostic Images/Studies:  Cardiac MRI (7/7): ? Normal biventricular size and systolic function. ? No regional wall motion abnormalities. ? Suggestion of increased T2 signal intensity/edema. ? Positive myocardial late gadolinium enhancement without functional correlate. ? No significant valvular dysfunction. ? No coronary artery aneurysms. ? Small pericardial effusion.  Echocardiogram (7/3): ? Normal valvular function. ? Normal left ventricular size and systolic function. ? Normal diastolic function indices. ? Reduced longitudinal strain with normal circumferential strain. ? Normal appearing proximal coronary arteries. ? Qualitatively normal right ventricular systolic function. ?

The child&#39;s arms and legs were stiff and stretched out and per father&#39;s observation, he claimed that his child&#39;s eyes were rolled backward. The child returned to &#34;normal&#34; status, he claims that he doesn&#39;t remember what happened. The child&#39;s hands were little shaky as he was attempting to drink water. We asked multiple questions - child claimed he was not nervous about the vaccine. Parents claimed that the child is doing better with vaccine anxiety compare to previous time, The child and parents informed that he did not eat anything yet. The child claimed that he is not dehydrated. 911 was called immediately at sight. EMT took the child&#39;s vital and reevaluated the child&#39;s condition. family wanted to follow up with their doctors (if correct, I believe EMT&#39;s vital check indicated 116/58 for BP) - our temperature measurement showed 97.3.

Labwork done  at that time showed modest nonspecific elevations of inflammatory markers CRP of 42,  (normal &lt; 8), ESR 50, calprotectin 285 (120 limit).  SARS covid-19 antibody semiquant to spike protein RBD was 64.4 U/mL (&lt;0.8, Labcorp).  Other tests did not identify another specific etiology, and an evaluation by another physician for myocarditis was reportedly normal.  As of 7/17 he feels better with a resolution of all symptoms, labwork repeated this past week (7/15) showed a resolution of those same inflammatory markers to normal levels .
