                                                Myalgias starting within 1 hour after vaccination, worsened throughout day that radiated to ipsilateral trapezius and rhomboid areas.  Starting around 16 hours after vaccination, severe subjective fevers and chills with severe headache that worsened with lying down. The headache was the most concerning symptom with tinnitus when laying flat in supine. It awoke me from sleep and prevented me from laying flat so I had to sleep upright on the couch. I took tylenol 500mg around 0200 and was able to sleep for a few hours. By 24 hours post vaccine, the headache and fevers/chills significantly improved so I could attend work the next day.

A 26-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EK9231; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 20:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. He received his first dose (age of vaccination was 26-year-old) of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EH9899; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s family history included his father has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine in a university hospital which set up a clinic. The patient reported that he thought he got his second dose last night at about 8 pm and since then in the morning around 8 am, so about 12 hours after he started having flu like symptoms that got pretty bad one point. He took some acetaminophen (TYLENOL) so it has gotten better but he was having myalgia, headache, fever, chills and nausea. The patient further mentioned that first, he started having chills around 8 am in the morning. He had chills before but now he kind of overheated and now he is not under a blanket anymore, so he thinks that is improved. He then started having nausea, then myalgia and then everything kind of got bad all at once. He mentioned that over all everything has improved except the headache. He further added that everything has not gone away complete but improved significantly. Earlier today (14Jan2021) like 2-3 hours ago he would say it was a 7 or 8 on a scale of 0-10 but right now it is about 4 on a scale of 0-10 and that goes for everything. He does not think anything else is confounding, he is not on any medications and has no chronic health problems, there has been no labs drawn. The patient did not visit an emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the outcome of the event headache was unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovering.

                                                Inflammation of previous knee injury; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 26-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid on 27Jan2021 around 15:20 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Prediabetic from Feb2019 and ongoing, obesity from 2021 and ongoing (thought he just turned the corner to obesity this year), previous knee injury. Family history included diabetes only. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine was reported as &#39;None&#39;.  The patient experienced inflammation of previous knee injury on 27Jan2021. He reported onset of inflammation of previous knee injury around 15:35-15:40 which was ongoing. He called to ask if this event was known to be associated with the vaccine; if it was normal, just an inflammatory response of old injuries that was expected or not. Inflammation of previous knee injury: Described as knee was probably about 25% bigger than normal, swollen and painful, ballooned up a bit with swelling. Noted when he started walking back to the vehicle and knee just started hurting real bad to bend the knee; Described as a bad knee, previous knee injury was an old high school injury where he tore the meniscus and a few other things in the knee. The bad knee normally did not hurt or bothered him, but flared up if he got sick. The swelling was only in his knee, not in his throat or anything else. The event did not require a visit to Emergency Room and Physician office. The outcome of the event was not recovered (reported as worsened).

                                                Patient presented with puffy eyes approximately 4 minutes after vaccination. Was alert and oriented to time, person, and place upon questioning and was able to engage in conversation. Parent (mother) of patient was present who gave patient&#39;s medical history and reported allergy to grass with similar reaction.  Blood pressure was taken and found to be 150/80. Mother reported patient had not taken his blood pressure medicine yet that day but his normal is 115/70 with  medication. While nurse was assessing patient&#39;s pulse (patient&#39;s pulse was WNL at 85) and other nursing staff was obtaining medication to administer if needed after assessment, patient became unresponsive to verbal commands and his upper body became limp. At 1054, a one time, single dose of 50 mg of diphenhydramine IM was given in the left deltoid. On site EMT arrived on the scene at 1055, completed assessment, and confirmed giving diphenhydramine was the best course of action. At this time, 1055, patient became responsive to verbal commands and was oriented to time, place, and person. At 1056 O2 sat was at 97%, pulse 70, and at 1100, BP was 110/70. Patient stayed for observation 30 more minutes and remained stable. Patient and parent were educated on side effects of diphenhydramine, to watch for any returning symptoms of allergic reaction throughout the day, and if/when to head to the ER. Recommended patient not receive 2nd dose of COVID vaccination.

Before bed time, had cold sweats and shakes. 1/29 - woke up feeling perfectly fine.  2/17 - Second dose of vaccine. Arm felt sore and was sore two days after. From 2/18-2/20, I noticed the effects of the Cymbalta were gradually decreasing and was experiencing side effects (shocks from toe to head every step). Turns out that even with taking my regular dose of the Cymbalta, my body after 2 hours feels like I had never taken it.   2/20 - After experiencing heavy shocks, shaking, and heart racing, I went home after coming into work 3 hours later.  2/21 - Woke up today feeling dizzy, fatigued, and weak. I know that operating a motor vehicle will not be possible for me.

                                                I had a blood report taken on the 25th of February as a part of my physical. I have never had elevated platelets, but this report showed my platelets at at 499 (130-450 is reference ranges of the lab). A year ago, my platelets were just below the max at 445. Upon discussing with my PA, he didn&#39;t feel too concerned, but after asking if the first dose covid shot may have something to do with it, that became a potential etiology.  I am very unsure of my elevated platelets is associated with the first dose. Arm was stiff on injection date for approximately 6 hours. Felt slightly flu like symptoms (headache, dizziness, fatigue) that same evening of injection date and felt fine the next morning.  Blood specimen was taken on 25th of February 2021. Diet at the time is a ketogeneic diet. I&#39;d like to make it clear I mean no deception and am unsure if there is an association with the vaccine and platelet levels, but my elevated platelets is inconsistent with any other blood report in the past, and the dose 1 covid vaccine was the only &#34;new&#34; thing in my life prior to the blood draw. I figured, better to let y&#39;all know in case it became relevant. Currently on no treatments for the platelets and was told to &#34;not worry about it&#34; which is hard for me to just take.

This rash appeared within a week or so of getting the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Over the next few weeks the rash slowly faded (not completely, though). When I woke up the morning after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, the rash doubled in coverage in the same areas of my body.   Around the time the rash showed up, I also began experiencing lower to mid-back pain, which grew more severe over time. The back pain is worst in the morning after sleeping, or after sitting/resting for longer periods of time. I&#39;ve been taking Ibuprofen and Aleve, which helps, as does being active. The back pain did not noticeably worsen after the second dose, but it is just as severe.   Currently, the rash has faded (not completely), and my back pain is still quite bothersome.

                                                On 2/13/2021, I began to experience both enhanced and new musculoskeletal and neurological symptoms that have not completely resolved still, today, 3/16/2021. While I had experienced some slight discomfort and pain of the b/l thumbs 2-3 weeks prior to 2/13, I began to experience increased pain up to the forearm in both arms on that day. In addition to pain, I had large muscular knots in the superior forearms, especially the right arm. The lower right arm felt extremely tight, and I was having difficulty raising the arm and gripping things. This continued for 2-3 weeks on the right arm. During that time, symptoms worsened on the left arm, while improving on the right arm. A week after the initial symptoms my left arm became worse, and I was struggling to lift objects as light as a sheet of paper. I was also having trouble typing at work, dialing the phone, and opening or closing my hand. Just over a week after symptoms began, I left work to determine a cause and solution for my issues. I also began to have tremors, extreme muscle spasms, and involuntary movements around this time for about 2-3 weeks. While the neurological symptoms have mostly subsided, still, today, 3/16/2021, I continue to deal with various inflammatory musculoskeletal symptoms affecting mostly my left arm, but also my right arm. Since yesterday, my left shoulder has begun to have pain as well, making raising my arm and reaching to the opposite side difficult due to pain. I have also had persistent popping of various joints in both arms since the initial symptoms began.

                                                This was my second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. I took some notes during my waiting time following my injection similar to my first dose. Information from my last report can be found using Temporary VAERS E-Report No: 334845. Of note, I did prepare for my second dose by taking Benadryl 50 mg and Airborne Immune-Boost supplements the night before my second dose, so my symptoms were not as severe as last time.  6 minutes: Mild tingling around tongue. This time all around the edges of my tongue, but a lot less bothersome than the first dose. 8 minutes: Weird. Slight itchiness under left half of tongue. Still very mild but less concerning than first dose itchiness on the left and right sides of my tongue. 18 minutes: Itchy on right side slightly, only side noticeable. 20 minutes: Mild warm feeling on left side of top of my throat. Less bothersome than time. 26 minutes: Left throat warm ness resolved, but transitioned to right side of top of my throat. 31 minute: Throat warmness overall resolved, but slightly itchy on edge of right side of my tongue. 37 minutes: Top of throat on right feels weird but not itchy. Warm maybe? 39 minutes: Weird feeling on right side of throat resolved.  Symptoms more or less resolved the rest of the day, especially after second dose of Flonase @ 9:00 am.  14 hours later: About to go to bed. Feeling fatigued, similar to my first dose after working out. Took airborne and two Benadryl (25 mg each) before sleeping.  24 hours later: 03/27/2021, feeling more fatigued, groggy, mild headache (mostly at back of my head), and muscle aches around my body.  25 hours later: Groggy feeling and fatigue resolved. Possibly due to Benadryl or vaccine?  32 hours later: Majority of muscle aches resolved. Headache also resolved. Feeling mostly soreness at this point.  Drank Airborne @ 10:00 am and 4:00 pm. In between drank plenty of fluids (water, cranberry juice, apple juice, milk). No fever or chills.

                                                About two or three days after my second Pfizer vaccination I started to feel some immense pain in my right trapezius. I had difficulty moving my neck for several hours. The pain subsided later that day but I still had adverse effects. I had a numbing and tingling feeling that traveled from my right trapezius all the way down to my fingers. That sensation continued for several weeks (3 or so) until I saw my general physician. She conducted some strength tests and noticed that there was some weakness and lack of coordination on my right side. I was instructed to go get and MRI and the results showed 5 lesions in my brain and 1 in my cervical spine (C2-C3). After many other tests including blood tests and a follow up MRI the neurologist that viewed my case informed me that I showed a strong case of demylination and it looked likely that Multiple Sclerosis.   The shot might have caused an immune response which allowed the MS to appear.

                                                First noticed symptoms after waking up during the night roughly 14 hours after receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Felt EXTREMELY fatigued and my heart was racing. Fell back asleep and woke up again around 8am. Symptoms persisted. Extremely tired and fatigued and heart was beating fast. Resting heart rate of around 100bpm which jumped to 120bpm when I moved at all (including just rolling over in bed). This persisted throughout the day, and I stayed in bed. In the early afternoon (about 24 hours after 2nd vaccine dose) I started to feel aches in neck and back and started a headache. Took my temperature and had a fever (101). Aches/headache continued to get worse throughout the afternoon. Finally around 4:30pm I found my Tylenol and took a dose. This substantially helped reduce all my symptoms; although I was still tired, it was much less than earlier in the day. Took a dose of Advil around 7:30pm and went to bed about an hour later. By morning, my symptoms were practically all gone, I was just slightly more tired than normal that day (2nd day after vaccine). I did not take any more medication.

Largely only a problem during flat bench, no issues with incline dumbbell press. Pain/soreness is isolated to the medial deltoid where the injection occurred, and only in the left arm where the injection occurred. Only began after dose 2. Noticed the week following the dose, pain persists. No treatment action taken.

                                                Initial event was hives that didn&#39;t itch appearing on elbows, they continued to spread for about a day. The doctor said to start Zyrtec, pepcid and ibuprofen. Hours later vomiting, diarrhea, and a blackout followed along with a fever of 102. This time ER gave IV fluids, acetaminophen, ketorolac, ondansetron, and sodium chloride .9%. At this time no mention or notice was made of the hives previously looked at. After this Zyrtec, Pepcid and acetaminophen were being taken regularly. Throughout the rest of that day the hives got worse along with pretty severe angioedema. Also, a feeling of swollowing around a lump in my throat. No change through the night into next day (Friday) for the hives,swelling and lump feeling in throat. Went to walk in clinic where I was prescribed prednisone tapered for 16 days. After the first day of steroids not much change. After 2 there was some improvement. As of today one week after receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine approximately 90% of the hives are gone, only mild swelling and some muscle fatigue and pain left.

                                                1st Pfizer shot beginning of April went fine. Only a sore arm. 2nd shot this past Saturday was a different story. I got the shot around 3:30 and felt great until about 7. My arm started getting very sore. It got better a little later in the day.  Next morning I felt pretty fatigued but nothing I haven?t felt before. Sore arm was still there. Pretty manageable. Had to pick up groceries and that was a mistake. Had to take deep breaths and my knees were in a lot of pain as I got out of the car and walked through the store (I injured them years ago and now have Baker&#39;s cysts). Wife brought me home and I had rigors on the ride back.  I got home around 11:45 or so and I put on a blanket. I felt so hot I started to get a little bit delusional and very sad/started getting teary. Took off blanket and couldn?t get off the couch or walk without help. Knees now felt like about to fall apart. Wife takes temp shows 107, makes ice bath, I get in and it goes down to 105 a few minutes later. Temp went down to 103 over the next 15-20 minutes and stayed there. Got out with her help and still couldn?t stand up or walk without help.  Sat upright in bed rest of the day. Fever ranged from 98-103, mostly 101-103. Took a very cold shower later in the day but temp still stayed in the same range. All other symptoms mentions else stayed the same. I also now had no appetite and felt nauseous. Stomach felt rock hard, and I didn?t feel too with it. Finally fell asleep later at night and woke up feeling way better but still awful. Monday and Tuesday I had to take off work I felt so fatigued. Both of those days I had no fever, it went away from Sunday night into Monday. I can walk by myself now and just feel a little fatigued today. I have my appetite back now and am back to work.  I should mention that I took Tylenol which didn?t help. Ibuprofen I took later in the day and that might have helped a little. Took Benadryl later and that helped with sleep.

Troponin-I on admission was 6.03 ng/ml prior to peaking at 21 ng/ml while initial CRP was 56.8 mg/L. Transthoracic echo (TTE) showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55-60% with hypokinesis of the basal lateral wall. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was consistent with myocarditis showing subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the basal inferior wall, no edema on T2 sequences, and a mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with an LVEF of 51%. He was started on colchicine, low dose beta blocker and losartan and improved symptomatically along with resolution of the EKG findings prior to being discharged with plan for close outpatient follow-up and repeat imaging.  In addition, a respiratory viral PCR panel was obtained which was positive for Rhinovirus/Enterovirus on nasal swab. Although it is possible that his presentation was secondary to enteroviral myocarditis, the temporal relationship to the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine suggests the possibility of myocarditis secondary to immunologic response to COVID-19 vaccine itself.

A 26-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11May2021 at 11:00 (Lot Number: EW0176, expiration date: Aug2021, at the age of 26-year-old) as 0.3 ml, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Apr2021 about 5:00pm (lot number: ER8731, expiration date: Jul2021, at the age of 26-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. When he got the first one, he was fine. The day after he received the second shot, he fainted while using the restroom and woke on the bathroom floor on 12May2021 at 07:30, he was on the floor for a few minutes, 2 to 3 minutes. After that there was no other fainting. Patient had been having heart palpitations since the second dose on 13May2021. Did not particularly remember the time, just that it was in the middle of the day. The palpitations were going away and were less prevalent. He went to the Emergency room (ER) this past Sunday night because it was really working up and he couldn&#39;t wait to go to the doctor. Physician office was no. Electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood work were done in the emergency room on unspecified date in May2021 and came back normal. He was supposed to meet with a cardiologist next week. On unspecified date in May2021, he still felt kind of like he senses his heart beating but he didn&#39;t usually think about. It felt more strange, than soreness. This was all just so new. Thought it was a sign that he was going to recover and it was going to go away. The palpitations were coming on less and less. Was not so much of an irregular heart beat than last week. On unspecified date in May2021, felt like his heart was getting strong. Felt like his heart was making it&#39;s way back and was more like a sore or a strain. It had been going down and he was not feeling his heart in his chest. Treatment was no, not this far. There was not prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The outcome of the event &#34;fainted while using the restroom and woke on the bathroom floor&#34; was unknown, for other events was recovering.

                                                A few hours after getting the 2nd dose, I had the following reactions (I didn&#39;t go to the doctor, I&#39;m just reporting what I experienced): *Slight rash consisting of pen-dot sized raised blisters which only appeared on top of a long-healed tattoo I have *Pain all throughout my right jugular (neck) *Sharp pain behind my right ear *Sleepiness *Dizziness *Muscle aches and muscle cramps  Most of these lasted less than 24 hours, but the tattoo rash was progressively becoming worse, I managed to get it under control on day 4 by applying hydrocortisone directly over the immidiate area. I still see a few bumps, but it seems to be healing. I didn&#39;t do anything differently in my daily routine; nothing changed (ie: same soap, same detergent, no contact with dust or etcetera). The tattoo also contains phosphorus, which might be related to the reaction.  The muscle aches and cramps are still ongoing; which is weird considering how I never get either and my daily activities haven&#39;t changed.

                                                I began to experience rapid heart rates to the 140s intermittently starting on the Wednesday following my first vaccination.  I also had associated neck pain and &#34;pounding sensation&#34; in my neck, chest, and arms. I had difficulty lying flat at night and developed a dry cough. I went to the urgent care on 4/19/21 and was diagnosed with torticollis. No one at the urgent care listened to my heart or lungs. Given that my symptoms had been diagnosed, I delayed seeking further treatment. My symptoms continued to worsen. I had difficulty walking long distances, exercising. I became short of breath easily. I ended up going to my primary care doctor on 4/26/21 for a second evaluation. He was concerned and did an EKG, it only showed sinus tachycardia. He scheduled me for an echocardiogram and put me on a beta blocker (Bystolic) 5 mg once daily. The echo showed EF 47% with global hypokinesis of the L ventricle. Doctor called me into the office as soon as he saw the results, concerned for myocarditis or pericarditis.

I had problems with my bowels, with intermittent constipation and diarrhea. The headache and bowel issues lasted for a couple of months, but they eventually subsided. The sore shoulder lasted for only a week or so. I called my doctor. I was told the symptoms were pretty standard and that I had no reason to worry.

Friday night and all of Saturday (almost 2 months later) I&#39;ve been having a cough, headache, fever, muscle pain, runny/stuffy nose, irritability, and loss of appetite, smell, and changed tastes. I&#39;ve self-isolated until I can get tested but it feels like the flu. But it&#39;s late June.

I began to develop symptoms that I have never previously felt and have sent me to the hospital in the time since. I have developed serious pins and needles sensation in my left foot, and hands. My left foot and leg constantly feel stiff. My left foot constantly feels as though it is buzzing or vibrating. I have received 3 blood test, imaging test, spent thousands of dollars trying to figure out what is wrong with me. The only thing in my life that changed was the covid vaccine. I can no longer work out due to pain in my leg. I am extremly heat intolerant. This vaccine has ruined my life.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly in unknown arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for routine mass immunizations (covid-19 immunization). The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Not a military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none and concomitant medications was none (he was on no other medications). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced tachycardia, intermittent palpitations, low grade fever/fever all started somewhere in the morning of 18Dec2020 and muscle aches on 17Dec2020. Physician assessed tachycardia and intermittent palpitations as serious due to medically significant. Physician stated that one of his workers had the vaccine and proceeded to have tachycardia and low grade fever. He would like to know if patient should get the second dose. The patient had mostly tachycardia with some intermittent palpitations. Patient was seen in his office on 18Dec2020, and got the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020. He also reported fever and muscle aches, although the fever was subjective and was not documented. Tachycardia improved and sent him to cardiology on 21Dec2020. It was not life threatening and they did an Electrocardiogram (EKG). His initial heart rate was 130. When he was seen again in their office on 21Dec2020, it was 93, which was baseline. It improved. He never got his temperature. The highest in office was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He had some muscle aches. The physician just sent patient to cardiology because he was having intermittent tachycardia and intermittent palpitations. Two visits to physician office. He was seen on 18Dec2020 and again on 21Dec2020. Relevant tests: they did testing for tachycardia but not related specifically. They did thyroid and EKG in office and he did not know if test were back. EKG was ok. The Thyroid, Complete blood count (CBC) and lipid (all were on an unknown date in Dec2020) were not back and were just done to make sure there were no cardiac issues. The outcome of the events was recovering. The lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events tachycardia and palpitations cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

                                                I would like to start out by saying that I am well aware that this vaccine is known to cause side effects and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any side effects induced by it. The reason I am writing this is to provide information that you all can keep in mind as you provide guidance on your recommendations for the timing of when the vaccine should be administered to those who have already tested positive for COVID. I tested positive for COVID-19 11 days prior to getting vaccinated. My symptoms from the virus began on 12/21/20, lasted until 12/26/20 and included: mild headache, fever of 100.3, moderate muscle fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and sinus congestion. I received the Pfizer vaccine on 1/3/21 at 11am and by 2am on 1/4/21 I was experiencing a temperature of 102.5, severe headache, severe muscle fatigue, and painful right axillary lymphadenopathy. Although they had almost completely resolved by 11am on 1/4/20, I would describe these side effects to the vaccine as significantly worse than the symptoms of the virus itself. As someone who has a stronger medical background than the general public (I am a 4th year dental student in a patient-facing role and was encouraged by my school to receive the vaccine despite already testing positive), I understood the likelihood of developing side effects to the vaccine and I am still planning on receiving my second dose in three weeks despite already showing clear signs of a strong immune response to the proteins created by the vaccine. The reason why I am writing this is because there was no guidance on recommending that I wait longer than 10 days between testing positive and receiving the vaccine and I am worried that if the general public is allowed to receive the vaccine at this same time interval, there will be a significant number of people who will have similar side effects (worse than those induced by the virus itself) and they will not only refuse a second dose, but could also vocally discourage many people from trusting the vaccine?s safety and benefit. I obviously don?t know what minimum timeframe should be recommended, but from my individual experience, 11 days was not sufficient. I will be happy to follow up if you would like to know how the symptoms fare after my second dose.

A 27-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 04Jan2021 11:15 AM (at the age of 27-years) as a single dose (Lot Number EK9231) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and no allergies to medications, food or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 12:00 PM (at the age of 27-years) as a single dose (Lot Number EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had not received any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 04Jan2021, approximately 10-12 hours after 2nd dose of vaccine the patient began to feel really cold, had some mild muscle pains, joint pains, and a headache. Overnight these symptoms worsened to severe muscle pains, joint pains, and a throbbing headache, shivering chills, took a temperature and had a fever of 101.7F. These symptoms did not subside until late the next morning. The headache had persisted. The patient reported taking paracetamol (TYLENOL) 1000 mg, which helped. The outcome of the events feels really cold, muscle pains, joint pains, throbbing headache, shivering chills, fever of 101.7F, were reported as recovering.

I called e-medicine and had a video call with a E-Medicine provider who told me to keep monitoring my symtoms and go to the ER if they got worse (fortunately they didn&#39;t); however there are some lingering effects. Currently I still am experiencing headaches (around my ears and temple area) with joint pain/body aches and occasional tingling/burning sensations in my fingers and feet.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package. I did experience very bad side affects:  headaches, muscle pains, tiredness, fatigue, weakness, low strength, dizziness, partial blindness, overwhelming stress, back pain, joint pain,  spinal pain, chills, fever like symptoms, nausea, spontaneous  pain, soreness in the arm, swelling throughout my body, difficulty breathing, short breaths.

                                                I&#39;ve been experiencing mild, but consistent adverse side effects to the vaccine. This vaccine. Is completely Terroristic. This vaccine is a biological warfare. I&#39;ve been very active in obtaining vaccinations. Flu shots, up to date with tetanus, and obtaining a second Immunization for chicken pox because I actually received the chicken, but had no vaccination. And. I need the vaccination record for school. So I had to get the chicken pox vaccine.  I&#39;ve been having mild, but very uncomfortable and consistent headaches. My sinuses all over my face are so filled. My eyes are watery, turn red, and at time so painful that it&#39;s difficult to open them. I have muscle weakness. I&#39;m always so thirty all the time. My urine smells  like uric acid. Has a rancid toxic smell to it. And. My urine is clear. But smells. My skin feels silky. And. the perspiration from my body, smells like formaldehyde. Smells clean, but smells like toxic formaldehyde and dead sticky body residue.  The most uncomfortable is the partial blindness. Headaches. Muscle aches. Joint aches. Neck pains. Eye pains. The consistent thirst.  I can&#39;t go to the doctor because I don&#39;t have insure. But. Most importantly. I don&#39;t have employment, because of the Government&#39;s illegal employment system that accounts for me. I&#39;ve been unemployed for 6 years. And. Have a private college degree from one of the top Universities in the USA.  Also. I&#39;ve been very active in producing sputum. Flem. My neck is swollen. And parts of my body are swollen. Not severely. But you can see there is minor swelling.  All the symptoms I&#39;m disclosing in this report, are minor. But. When collectively experienced. Is unbarable. Extremely Uncomfortable. And. You&#39;re expecting me to get another dosage of this experience. Being. 2 months incapacitated. This is even illegally distributed. What the hell. In God&#39;s name. Are you people in there doing. And. Why are you people in the Government even able to get away with this.

A constant metallic taste was in mouth and nothing (mints, brushing teeth, drinking water, etc.) removed it. Metallic taste resolved after 24 hours. Other symptoms lasted about 36 hours.

                                                When I woke up on Sunday, April 11th, 2021 at around 9am, I have felt like my muscles have been ripped apart, I was sweating, I had labored breathing, and I could not get up for the day. I slept all day, feeling like I had the flu, and was sleeping until 7pm that day. I called out of work when I woke up because I knew on Monday I would not be able to make it, as I felt like I was very tired, lethargic, and sore. This feeling was throughout every inch of my body. I also went to take a shower that day and I had a hard time breathing in the shower, to the point where I had to sit on the edge of the tub, just to make sure I would not pass out from lack of oxygen. This was the scariest sickness I have ever had in my entire life. I literally thought I was going to die. Monday came around and I felt even worse, my muscles were sore, I felt extremely tired, I could not do anything, and I was in bed all day. Today is Tuesday, and I have felt a little bit better, but I have missed two days of work because of the effects this vaccine has had on my body. I made a virtual appointment with a doctor on the app on phone and met with Doctor who basically told me that the only thing I could do for myself is take Ibuprofen every 8 hours for the pain and swelling that might occur and drink plenty of gatorade. It is Tuesday, April 13th, 2021 at 11:29pm at night and I still feel the same as Monday, very weak, tired, and sore all over my body. I have never had this with a vaccine before, until I got the COVID-19 one. I have taken the Flu Vaccine, Hep A, Tantnius, Chicken Pox and never felt like I was so tired I could not get out of bed from these vaccines.

I thought these were regular side effects and eventually got better.   Then, about a week later I started getting nose bleeds with blood clots coming out of my nose.  These lasted a few more days. This never happened to me before, and must have been a side effect from the vaccine.

                                                Pain developed in shoulder approximately 3-4 hours post vaccination. Progressed to complete inability to move shoulder, extreme pain upon any movement at all. Pain described as severe stabbing, burning pain centered in shoulder joint and deltoid muscle, causing complete incapacitation of left arm.  At scheduled Doctor&#39;s visit 5 hours later,  Advil was recommended. Patient decided to take Tylenol instead to avoid contraindication due to possible immune-reducing effects of Advil during vaccine immune-development time period.  29 hours after vaccine administration, 1000mg of Tylenol brought slight relief; at 35 hours 1000mg Tylenol taken again with similar effect, allowing more comfortable sleep, but shoulder had to remain immobilized to avoid severe pain.   At the time of this report, 55 hours have elapsed since administration of vaccine. Range of motion has increased to approximately 3 inches, after which strong pain and tightness occurs. Left arm still largely incapacitated beyond very slight motions like holding light object. Gentle motions of readjustment to sitting and typing on computer still cause pain past limit of range of motion. Shoulder/arm cannot be raised to any meaningful height without pain. Patient tends to bring arm close to body to avoid pain, effectively resulting in frozen shoulder.  PLEASE NOTE: Vaccine site was observed to be much higher up on shoulder than dose #1. Patient is concerned vaccine may have been administered into an area that may have caused entry of vaccine into shoulder joint space or bursa, at least 2 inches higher than suggested central deltoid muscle injection site.

A 27-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EV8732/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 07Apr2021 at 13:45 (at the age of 27 years old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included COVID-19 on an unspecified date. The patient did not have any known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication (other medications taken in two weeks) were none.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 19Apr2021 at 22:00, the patient experienced similar symptoms to pericarditis, with debilitating pain that was exasperated while lying down, Heart palpitations, left armpit with pain radiating to entire left shoulder through the middle of the neck, low grade fever, severe fatigue and slightly dry cough. The events required a physician&#39;s office visit. The patient received treatment for these events. The clinical course of the events was as follows: Heart palpitations originating under left armpit with pain radiating to entire left shoulder through the middle of the neck. Similar symptoms to pericarditis, with debilitating pain that was exasperated while lying down, low grade fever, severe fatigue, and slightly dry cough. Lasted about 30 hours. Discomfort relief, like pericarditis, was only felt when sitting up and propping myself up by my arms leaning forward. Onset was rapid, occurring 13 days after the first dose of the vaccine over a period of 8 hours (palpitations came first, followed by shoulder and neck pain in the morning). Treated with Aspirin at first (low effectiveness) followed by NSAID Advil 7 hours later (high effectiveness, symptom relief was about 50%). High strength Advil recommended by MD. The outcome of the events was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Moderate aches experienced on the day following vaccination (5/23) beginning in the morning. Two doses of ibuprofen taken in the morning and afternoon.  Mild pain experienced in left front armpit, nearly on the left pectoral, on the night following vaccination. On the following morning (5/24), moderate swelling was noticed in the left armpit, extending from underneath the armpit down to the upper lat muscles and up along the left pectoral nearly to the nipple up to just below the left collarbone. Mild pain experienced in the left front armpit as well as on the lymph node under the armpit. No inhibition of arm motion or pain when using arm, but some feeling of discomfort and pressure. Tele-med help was sought which did not recommend any course of action. By the afternoon, moderate swelling was noticed on the left arm, on the bicep and tricep down to the elbow. Ibuprofen was taken at ~3pm with no effect. Medical advice was sought at 7pm and it was recommended to head to urgent care, but all providers in the area were closed. By this morning (5/25), the swelling has reduced significantly and localized to the left front armpit. Mild pain remains, now more localized to the lymph node under the left armpit.

                                                Around 2 weeks after my first dose, I started having heart palpitations. The palpitations were on and off for a week and I didn&#39;t think of it much. A week after the palpitations started it started happening more frequently and I was feeling light headed and I went to ER. I was diagnosed with SVT and put on metoprolol to control my heart rate. 1 week after I was on metoprolol, I took my second dose. I was feeling a little dizzy after my second dose but it improved after like 10 minutes. I started getting very fatigued and difficult to concentrate after my second dose. I  spoke to my doctor and we thought it was because of metoprolol. My cardiologist took me off metoprolol but the fatigue didn&#39;t stop and I started having aches in shoulders, arms, neck and back. The aches and fatigue was more severe in the morning. After a week of being off metoprolol I started waking up with chest pain. One day the pain was severe and I had aches in shoulders, arms, neck and back and my heart rate was around 140 so I went to ER. The doctors put me on carvedilol and my heart rate has been controlled but my body aches and fatigue has been going on. The cardiologist and my PCP aren&#39;t sure if SVT or the medication is causing my body aches and fatigue. The only other thing I could think of was the vaccine so I wanted to send this report.

Presented to ED and found to have elevated troponin, initially normal ECG. Admitted to hospital, experienced recurrent chest pain, rising troponin to 23750, and STE on ECG, and was taken to cath lab, with normal left heart cath. Then transferred to heart medical center for further eval and cardiac MRI. Felt by cardiology there to have myopericarditis potentially related to Pfizer vaccine. Cardiology also wondering if possible inflammatory bowel disease might increase his risk of myocarditis, though no established diagnosis (outpatient gastroenterology workup planned).

                                                Symptoms of 2nd Covid vaccine lot EL 1284: numbness in feet, legs throbbing, muscle weakness in legs, overall tiredness  I received my second Pfizer vaccine on 1/12/21 at 12:15 pm.  After several hours, I felt weak and tired.  By 7:00 pm, I had a migraine that wouldn?t go away and I had muscle ache in my feet and legs.  On 1/13/21 I felt some numbness in my feet and my legs were throbbing.  By 10:00 pm, both of my feet were completely numb and my legs were throbbing/radiating heat.  It felt as if circulation was cut off from my feet entirely.  On 1/14/21 I went into work where I?m constantly on my feet.  I felt intense muscle weakness in my legs and thighs to point where I could barely stand up.  I immediately went to an urgent care where they started me on an Sodium Chloride 0.9% intravenous IV solution drip.  They ran blood tests and urine tests to rule out any other causes to my symptoms.  All results came back negative.  I was told to rest, hydrate, and recover for the next several days.  If my symptoms did not subside within the next couple days, I was instructed to go to the ER for further examination.

Lying on the side provided minimal relief but the pain was still moderate.  Nausea also accompanied the pain but the patient denied any vomiting.  Patient decided to go to the ED for work-up.   Patient had two further episodes of chest pain and EKG revealed diffuse ST elevations. Troponin level peaked at 3.02. He was diagnosed with myopericarditis and started on colchicine, with improvement of chest pain.

I&#39;ve taken ibuprofen and tried icing it to help with the swelling.

                                                On May 13 (3 Weeks after first covid vaccine shot), I started to feel skin pain on the area above right kneecap. Then I felt nerve pain on the same side of leg.  May 14 I couldn&#39;t sit down as I felt occasional lumbar pain. I even went to orthopedics and they said no trouble found. Skin pain spread through the whole body.  May 15 I had second shot of pfizer, still back pain and thigh pain. Skin pain spread through whole body. May 16 I saw red spots begin to surface on the thigh.  Skin pain spread through whole body. May 17 red spot became bigger I thought it was rash, pain persists.  May 18 the red spots looks out of control, I scheduled the next available appointment for primary care (2days later!)   May 19 Just bigger red spots every time I take off my pants.  May 20 black bubbles appeared in the morning, and I got to finally go to appointment at noon, diagnosed as shingles.

                                                On days 1 and 2, I experienced normal symptoms from receiving the vaccine, fatigue, joint and head aches that lasted through the weekend and up to day 5. On day 5, I noticed unilateral lymphedema of my tonsils. On day 7, I went to an Urgent Care but didn&#39;t get much treatment. My condition worsened, I was fatigued, no appetite and thirsty. On day 8, I popped a fever of 103. On day 9, it worsened to the point that it was hard to breathe. I went to the ER on 10 and had a full array of tests. I was treated with dexamethasone and a bolus saline IV. My symptoms went away after treatment around day 14, but the lymphedema lingered for awhile longer.

A 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of Bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EP7534), via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 01Apr2021 at 08:00 AM (at the age of 28 years) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history included asthma and allergies to penicillin and cephalosporin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 02Apr2021, (on the day following her first dose of covid vaccine), the patient experienced the side-effects / symptoms including strong headache, muscle aches and fatigue. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovered in 2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

These symptoms were resolved the next day (5/15), but that night I had an intense episode of chest pain that lasted 5-7 hours.  These symptoms went away and then returned again for a second time (5/17) around 4am for around 3-4 hours, while flying back.  I went to the hospital and had concerns from doctors over my ECG and raised troponin levels.  I spent 2 nights in the hospital and was diagnosed with Myocarditis.  This was then validated through an MRI the following day.  I am now resting at home for 3 months and taking ibuprofen.

                                                The following day after the second shot. I had started to get serious pain in the armpit/swollen lymph node. I have had swollen lymph nodes in the past for certain infections so theres a chance I have a predisposition to getting them, but haven&#39;t had an issue in many years. However, I reached out to a friend that works for a company and she said to report this. The deep lymph node in my left armpit is many times larger than the left and I cannot let my arm rest at its side due to the size and pain.

Both of my legs and both of my hands were also tingling upon waking up. 911 was called by my wife.

                                                Muscle soreness in left arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 28-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6204) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Mar2021 at 13:00 (at the age of 28-years-old), as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. The concomitant medication included TYLENOL and unspecified medications for unknown indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 10Mar2021 at 19:00, the patient experienced muscle soreness in left arm for approximately 24 hours and cleared up the next day. The patient did not receive any treatment for the reported event. The adverse event did not result in a visit to the doctors or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, and emergency room/department or urgent care. The clinical outcome of muscle soreness was resolved on 11Mar2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I started having intermittent numbness, tingling, pain and weakness in my left arm down to my hand about a week after my second Pfizer Covid vaccination. Over several months it progressively was getting worse. I am a nurse in a hospital and after speaking with several colleagues (other nurses and doctors) about what was going on, I went to my PCP. After seeing my PCP, I was referred to a Hand to Shoulder Center. The doctor declared it as cubital tunnel syndrome in which I had an Ulnar Nerve Release Surgery on June 8th. Approximately a week and a half to two weeks after the surgery I started noticing intermittent numbness and tingling to the left side of my lips and left side of my face. Until I started having issues with my face, I didn&#39;t even consider the possible correlation with my problems and the COVID vaccines. It it just ironic that I received both vaccines in my left arm and I am having issues with my left arm and the left side of my face. I am still having numbness, tingling and some weakness to my left arm as well as the intermittent numbness and tingling to the left side of my face. Now I was advised by the surgeon that it could take up to a couple of months for my issues with my arm to resolve but when I contacted my PCP regarding an update on my arm as well as to inform her about the concerns with my face, and questioning the possible correlation with the COVID vaccines, she advised me to file a report through VAERS.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I started feeling hyperaware. For example, my wife smokes but not around me and for the first time, I could smell cigarettes in the car. Also, my dog who is rather clean, I could smell which is not usual. I had back pain. My tongue felt tingly and numb, my blood pressure was at around 150, my heart rate was at around 116. This persisted for about 30 mins or so. I was sent to the ER and was there for about 6 hours. Since the vaccine, I could be doing nothing, and I?d have random bouts of extremely high heart rate. For about a month after the vaccine I had trouble doing even the most mundane tasks. I was first put on metoprolol for about 2 weeks. I was put on a Holter monitor so I had to stop taking it. I was then switched to atenolol which has helped since. After the vaccine, I was going to the bathroom once every 4 days which was unusual for me. It was also yellow which was abnormal for me. I also lost about 20 lbs in this time frame which my doctor credited due to the elevated heart rate. I had to take time off from work because walking from my car to my office was exhausting for me. I was on atenolol which definitely helped but my doctor suggests that I take half a pill. Taking half a pill does not help with the heart rate compared to the original dosage. My most recent episode of elevated heart rate was about 3 weeks ago. I am also on omeprazole which I am not certain if it is helpful. I also am experiencing random muscle pains on the left side of my body. My doctor also credits some of these symptoms to anxiety which I have never experienced before. Essentially, for the first 1-2 months, my heart rate was extremely high but after the atenolol, it has returned to normal. In the ambulance the paramedic noted that when I was lying still my heart rate was normal but when I would move or talk my heart rate would jump up.  Also, just to note, after receiving my vaccine I interacted with my cousin who I later found out had COVID.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Cervical and clavicular lymphadenopathy on the left side; Some tenderness in neck; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 29-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 17Dec2020 at 11:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the hospital. On 27Dec2020, the patient experienced cervical and clavicular lymphadenopathy on the left side (same side as the vaccine shot was received). The patient first noticed some tenderness in neck about 10 days after vaccine was administered. The events were considered non-serious. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient had not recovered from the events.   Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

A 29-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EK4176) in the hospital, via intramuscular route on 10Feb2021 at 10:30 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from 2010 to 2011 and allergies to penicillin on an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to vaccination, was the patient not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: H9899) in the hospital, via intramuscular route at 01:15 PM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that on 12Feb2021 at 08:00 PM (also reported as &#39;3 days after injection&#39;) the patient experienced flu-like symptoms that included fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, and a persistent headache. On 13Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 4th day&#39;, the patient developed pleurisy and difficulty breathing and had 2 syncope events the morning of 14Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 5th day&#39;). The patient was taken by ambulance and admitted to ER for further testing. It was determined that all symptoms likely related to the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine recently received. Pleurisy persists one week following vaccine dose. The patient went to the emergency room/department or urgent care due to the events. As treatment for the event, the patient was monitored and given IV fluids over 12 hour stay in CDU. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae (reported as recovered with lasting effects). The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Felt extremely inflamed - I couldn&#39;t do push ups. My right ankle swelled up pretty extreme. I had not been running or anything.  Sometimes it would hurt my foot, and another day my right wrist would bother me and then the next day the other wrist. My knees bothered me a little bit too. It was an achy, dull pain. My knees sometimes bother me anyway but this was a bit different.  I called my PCM - she told me that I could take Motrin or Ibuprofen - and use cold compress or apply heat. My ankle was just one night and it went away the next day. My wrists bothered me for about a full week or so. That was pretty hindering - I couldn&#39;t pick up my children.  For the first dose - I had an extreme level of fatigue for about 24 hours - the first 48 hours after vaccine. I felt bodily and mentally tired. I stayed in bed and hydrated for two straight days. The second vaccine I had no reaction.

                                                At around 11 pm the night of getting the vaccine in the morning, I began to feel fatigued, achy, and chills. I went to bed soon after, and started to have a headache. Had trouble sleeping the whole night because of the pain, when I woke up at 6 am all symptoms were worse.  These symptoms continued throughout the morning, after a couple hours a new symptom started: a pain in my left armpit and the left pectoral (just part of it closest to the armpit). I was vaccinated in the left arm. This pain grew in intensity. By 11 pm  on 4/16 (when I?m filling this out), the armpit pain is sharp. The other symptoms have subsided a bit (headache, chills, aches and fatigue).

                                                Foot and ankle inflammation and swelling. It started out with my left foot/ankle but it is now impacting my right foot/ankle also. Currently, it has gotten to the point where I essentially can?t walk. I am having similar symptoms with my knees and right index finger but they are not as severe and not as debilitating.  I am currently waiting for an appointment with a rheumatologist.

                                                Directly after administration of the vaccine, the patient started to feel like he was going to faint and became nauseous. I got him some water and when I returned he was slouched in his chair. His leg and arms started to twitch for at least 10 seconds and he was incoherent. After the twitching stopped, he seemed to not have full recollection of the past minute and asked if he had passed out. His shoulder muscles were tight, he felt very warm, and soon after become nauseous but did not vomit. We gave him an ice pack to cool him down in addition to the cold bottle of water. We waited for a friend to come pick him up and during the wait he recovered and was able to hold a conversation, not feel dizzy, and stand up on his own. After 30 minutes of observation, the friend arrived so I walked with him out of the pharmacy to the car.

                                                Day after vaccine, I was sick all day. Hard to breathe; heart rate would shoot up and then come down in one minutes sessions; I had body aches - all over. Doing anything felt painful. Eating was uncomfortable and sitting was uncomfortable. I had some fever. 238.5 Celsius and it got a little worse during the day (and that number is the end of the day). I had some pain in the chest, too - center of chest. I also had a headache throughout the day. I did a televisit (wednesday)  and she advised to take acetaminophen for fever. She said my blood pressure was fine and my heart rate was still under 100 most of the time. The next day, everything seemed fine - all symptoms seemed to go over night except heart rate - still was elevated and the difficulty breathing was still there. Even sitting - my breathing and heartrate felt like it was working. Friday, things were mostly similar - heart rate came mostly down. But end of day, difficulty breathing came worse and chest pain became worse and tightening of chest was more intense. No fever after Wed though. I went to see the Urgent Care doctor at Urgent Care. Friday, the second week after the vaccine, the symptoms received. Pain in left arm started (started Tuesday or Wed the second week)  and I had chest pain and tightness in the chest and slight difficulty breathing, nausea, dizziness and no fever.  ER - on Saturday - 11:30PM - they did more tests - everything heart related came back fine so they ruled out Heart attack; but didnt&#39; know what it was; gave medication for nausea in case it would help. IV medication and then one medicine to drink on the spot. It didn&#39;t really help - the symptoms continued and slowly disappeared the next day (the second Sunday after the vaccine). Nothing new since then.

A 29-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: En6202) via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 17Mar2021 (at the age of 29-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. The patient did not have allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not tested positive for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient had not received any other medications in two weeks prior to vaccination. On 18Mar2021, the patient started the morning after vaccine, with just a sore arm (pain in arm). The second day after the vaccine, it felt like the patient had torn muscles in shoulder--intense pain (shoulder pain) and limited range of motion, without any muscles feeling tense or locked up (movements reduced). The third day, pain and sensation continued to worsen in arm and shoulder, until it spread to spine (condition worsened). By the end of the night, arm started to feel okay but spine hurt more and more (pain in spine), feeling like it had a compression injury. It was reported that, the patient that if he had no memory, and someone told he had been in a car accident, or compressed his spine by jumping from 30 feet in the air, he would readily believe it. It was the fourth morning as the patient wrote, and spine still felt same way. No physical activity or other explanation for sudden pain, no prior history of injury/pain for these areas. It was unknown if the patient had received any treatment for the events. The outcome of the events shoulder pain, movements reduced, condition worsened, pain in spine was not resolved and for event pain in arm was resolving at the time of this report.   No follow up attempts are needed. No further information is expected

                                                Uncertain if truly caused by the vaccine.  I had an ACL reconstruction done back in May of 2020.  My knee has transient swelling that comes and goes, but is not particularly frequent.  3 days after receiving the vaccine, my knee swelled up and remained swollen for about 7 days.  It has since gone back down.  I did not have any acute injuries or remarkable events happen during this time other than the vaccine administration.  Overall, uncertain if it was caused by vaccine, but it was odd enough to report.

                                                20 hours after injection, I started having progressively worsening severe back pain, neck pain, headache, chills (no fever), skin sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, and brain fog. 2 days after the vaccine, I had abdominal pain, and cough. All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

                                                In the evening after getting the shot, I started getting chills and became more sensitive to cold temperatures.  Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

Current day a lot of pain in jaw neck throat face still only happening on left side of body more pain then before but less swelling neck still swollen a little bit. I tried cough drops soup heat ice and still having pain don?t want to pay for an ER visit found old painkillers haven?t taken yet. How long do symptoms like these last for ?

A 30-year-old male patient received second dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization (reported as &#34;I guess to protect myself from other people, to protect myself&#34;). There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient took his first dose on 20Dec2020, 3 weeks from there, he took the second on 10Jan2021 (reported as &#34;it was 10th it was Sunday morning when I took it&#34;). The patient reported that he had his second dose on Sunday morning (10Jan2021) and started feeling tired last Monday (11Jan2021). Then on 12Jan2021 (reported as &#34;yesterday&#34; at the time of reporting), he started to feel his chest and neck hurting. The patient stated that he woke up in the middle of the night (Sunday night) and Monday morning, he was feeling really sick so he called out rest all day on Monday (11Jan2021). Then patient woke up yesterday morning (12Jan2021) feeling good then probably about 6 o&#39;clock last night he started feeling tired, like real bad tired and he got home. Patient lied down and woke up in middle of night, his chest, arms and head were hurting. His neck and all around head area were hurting real bad. The events were assessed as non-serious. The patient does not have the lot number but stated that it was the Pfizer vaccine. When the patient was asked if still experiencing tiredness and chest hurting, he stated &#34;When I started, that was last night on I will go with the 12 before midnight 12 (not clear). Yes right now yeah. This is the first time my chest and my arms and my neck and like all that has been hurting, started last night&#34;. When asked for the treatment, the patient answered &#34;I took Ibuprofen to calm it down a little bit. I took Ibuprofen if you count that as a treatment&#34;. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Shoulder soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 30-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EK4176; Expiration date was not reported) on 07Jan2021 at a single dose on the right arm, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the workplace clinic. The patient had no relevant medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EH9899; Expiration date was not reported), intramuscularly on the left arm on 16Dec2020 (when the patient was 30 years old) for COVID-19 immunization. On 07Jan2021, the patient had shoulder soreness. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. The outcome of the event, shoulder soreness, was recovered on 09Jan2021. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested since the vaccination.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Also felt unusually anxious, though unsure if that was directly due to the vaccine or to the inability to sleep for a number of days because of the feverish chills. Acute symptoms lasted for 48 hours, and prohibited me from being able to work from home.   I still have what feels like a lingering sinus headache (with no actual sinus symptoms) as well as some fatigue. Lingering headache is not debilitating, but it is irritating. Feels a bit like a sensation of pressure in my forehead.

                                                11pm on day of (Sunday) vaccination felt soreness in left arm at injection site and in entire upper arm when trying to hold it up. Soreness subsided by noon the next day, Monday. No symptoms on Tuesday until late evening when tongue began to feel sore. On Wednesday morning around 6am, woke up with severe body fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, nausea, headache. Hands and fingers very cold to the touch. Severe fatigue and weakness all day. Sore tongue persisted. No respiratory symptoms present. By Thursday (today), body is still feverish, joint and muscle aches persist, light headache at times. Still fatigued and weak. All symptoms today Thursday are much weaker except for the muscle and joint pain which remains high.  The reason I am reporting this is that from what I&#39;ve read and been told, the delayed onset of these symptoms (almost 3 days) is very unusual, especially because I had little/no symptoms in the first 2 days of the vaccine.

A 30-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot Not Provided, second dose) solution for injection intramuscular on an unknown date (at the age of 30-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Cystic Fibrosis and Autoimmune Necrotizing Myositis. Concomitant medications were unknown. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (first dose) for COVID-19 vaccination on an unknown date with no adverse effect reported (tolerated first COVID-19 vaccine). The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Less than 24 hours after second COVID-19 vaccine injection, the patient had severe polymyalgia. CPKs checked very high at 80,000. The patient was currently admitted to the hospital. Unspecified treatment was provided for the events severe polymyalgias and CPKs very high. The outcome of the events severe polymyalgias and CPKs very high was unknown. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was supposed to get RITUXAN as a regimen for his muscle disorder and was interested in Pfizer checking his neutralizing antibody level both pre and post Rituxan. The patient will receive RITUXAN shortly in the next week.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine causality between events severe polymyalgia and CPKs checked very high and  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE0 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 30-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: el1283), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, on 09Jan2021 11:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mild asthma, allergies to fur, mites and olive tree pollen from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) in two weeks included finasteride taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: ek5730) at 30-year-old on 19Dec2020 08:00 PM at left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination. No Covid tested post vaccination. A few hours after the second dose, the patient experienced back and joint pain, shivers and headaches for two days. On 19Jan2021 (reported as 10 days after the second dose), the patient started experiencing tingling sensation (paresthesia) in both legs without loss of sensitivity or strength. Also, the patient started having lumbar pain similar to a mild muscle cramp. The paresthesia was somewhat strong for a week and started to very slowly fade away, but the patient still has intermittent lumbar discomfort and mild tingling sensation in his feet and sometimes legs depending on posture. Possibly a demyelinating neuropathy. No treatment AE. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                At 3pm i woke up very cold. I started to shiver. I added five blankets, put on a beanie, warm socks, turned on heater in my room and was still freezing. About an hour after that started to get muscle weakness. This was my second shot. Whats weird is that inhad covid in late January but i still had these side effects the second shot. First shot, no symptoms

Around the same time I also experienced fatigue. The morning after the aches and fatigue I experienced nausea after brief periods of physical activity.

                                                At approximately 4:30pm, on the day I got the vaccine, I began to feel the effects of Encephalopathy and Encephalitis, in which I began to feel pressure in my skull, and felt confusional thinking. It became hard to discern my thoughts. I also, began to experience a difficult time with my vision not being able to control what my vision was focusing on, as well as seeing a blue tint in my vision. I am also experiencing mild pressure and aches on the right side of my back and left side of my chest. These effects have been continuous for the last 4 days. To treat these symptoms I have been using natural remedies, and have maintained a stable condition due to that.

A 30-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: ER8730) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 31Mar2021 15:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroid. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium taken for hypothyroid. The patient previously received tetanus vaccine (6 weeks out from his Covid Vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient stated that his side effects began on 01Apr2021. He noticed tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck. This was the same side of the body he got the vaccine on. His symptoms worsened over the next two days. He had increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck. On Saturday 03Apr2021. it took him a half an hour just to get out of bed. Stated that he went to the Emergency Room at the hospital where he works and they did a series of tests. He had CAT Scans with and without contrast, a MRI, and an Ultrasound. Mentioned later that they also did blood work (Apr2021). The Emergency Room doctor told the caller he was going to have his CAT scan read by a specialist. Caller stated they called him on Sunday 04Apr2021 and said his CAT scan showed an inflammatory infectious process with atypical organisms and Lymphadenopathy. He stated that he read that Lymphadenopathy was a side effect of the vaccine. They told him that the Lymphadenopathy was compressing the nerves in his neck and causing his pain and decreased range of motion. He had been on a week of treatment consisting of pain medications, muscle relaxers, and anti-inflammatory medications. The Infectious Disease was consulted and he was started on a 5 day course of Azithromycin. He was on the third day of this antibiotic per his report. He has a follow up MRI scheduled next Friday. He was calling to report his side effects and also to ask about what he should do in regards to his appointment for his second dose of the vaccination. His symptoms were worsening for the first three days. Since he has been being treated for them they have started to improve slowly day by day. Today he said there was minimal pain and tightness but he was still not back to one hundred percent. He was offered admission to the hospital for pain control after his emergency room visit but he decided to defer it to an outpatient setting. Was not admitted to the hospital. The patient felt that the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; were medically significant and stated they were disabling, at least temporarily. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; was recovering while unknown for the other events. Patient stated that he felt all of his adverse events were caused by the COVID Vaccination he received.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be excluded based on the temporal relationship. Case will be  reassessed if additional information is received. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

                                                Given second dose of covid vaccine on friday in the right arm 04/23/2021. The day after the covid vaccine I ran a high fever from about 7:30am until about 9pm on Saturday 04/24/2021.  During Saturday I drank lots of water to combat the fever but I noticed blood in my urine.  The blood got worse through out Saturday into Sunday and I noticed slight pain in my lower back and lower abdomen.  On Sunday morning (04/25/2021) my urine was a dark burgundy color.  This was quite alarming as it was very thick and not as light as the day before.  I drank lots of water on sunday and made sure to watch my urine.  The urine stayed red in color.  I called a telehealth nurse  on Sunday and they suggested I go to Urgent care in the morning.  I woke up on Monday (04/06/2021) with less blood in my urine but still went to urgent care to be safe.  At Urgent care I received a Urine analysis.  The doctor told me there was blood and protein in my urine.  He ruled out a UTI or an STD. The doctor said there may be kidney damage since there is protein present but it cannot be confirmed with the levels. The doctor advised that I continue to drink liquid and watch for worsening signs.  The doctor said I should contact him immediately if the blood or pain gets worse. The doctor also stated I should fill out this VAERS form. Today (04/27/2021) there has been less blood in my urine but there is still some pain in my lower abdomen.  I will contact the doctor at the end of the week to let him know what has happened to my symptoms, he requested I keep him informed.

                                                Approximately 3-5 minutes post-vaccination, patient was seated, texting a message on cell phone, and fainted. Slumped out of chair face down. Witnessed by several volunteer employees. Not witnessed by pharmacist who had administered the vaccine. Volunteers called for help. Immediately pharmacist responded to patient. Loss of conscious noted. Patient was assessed and gently rolled to back with head support and began to regain consciousness, stiffened arms and legs noted. Patient asked, &#34;Do you have a history of seizure disorder?&#34; Initially unable to respond. Pharmacist requested 911 be called as is looked like a seizure. Asked again, and then patient shook head no and then verbal no. Muscles more relaxed. Stroke assessment performed with arms and legs equal to weight, no facial droop, verbal back to normal. Patient asked if he would like to sit up in chair after about 5 minutes on back. Patient complained of headache but no other injuries. Stated he had no bump on his head. Paramedics arrive in less than 10 minutes from call.  Assessed patient. Vitals normal. Skin color normal from pale. Paramedics assumed vasovagal fainting episode. Pharmacist agreed.

I didn&#39;t have any on hand, so I offered chocolate. When I came back he tried to reach for it, but was struggling. He dropped it and started making jerking movements and slumping over. I put my hand on his chest to keep him propped up and called for my technician. After a minute or so, he was responsive, but sweating and his skin tone became washed out. I told him he should lay on the floor and prop his feet up on the chair. He said that made him feel better. I got him some orange juice to drink after he got off the floor. He remained near the location for 30mins and then did some shopping to make sure he would be okay before leaving with his wife.

These symptoms worsened throughout the day. My pulse felt weak. My breathing became rapid and shallow, even though it was not difficult to draw breath. The major symptoms on 6/7 were headache, with a sense of my motion being affected. My urine throughout this time was excessively dark, even though I was drinking more water than normal. The following day, 6/8, most of my joints began to heart, and I became very stiff; this sx lessened after taking a long, slow walk.  On 6/13 another event involving slowed heart rate, subjectively weak pulse, and shortness of breath ensued. There had been no unusual or excessive physical activity, and as I had not experienced this phenomenon before receiving the second vaccine dose on 6/4, I believe that the 6/13 event was also linked to the vaccination.

I tried sitting up, turning over side to side, and the pain continued. This was accompanied by a severe chill that caused my teeth to rattle. The apartment was set to 68 which is slightly warm to me. I got up to go to the restroom and my legs grew tired almost immediately. I?ve tried laying back down and getting back up 2 more times. The chill and the pain have continued now for 3 hours and 17 minutes, although the chill has diminished to a mild child instead of severe. No notable fever has been measured thus far.

                                                I was immunized with the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines on May 4th, 2021, and on May 5th started experiencing left shoulder pain radiating to the arm, and upon breathing in pain would intensify. On the night of May 5th pain started to increase and decided to report to the hospital. On May 6th I was admitted to the hospital to further identify what was causing the shoulder pain, deferent test were performed with normal result but upon performing CT Scan, it was identify that I had blood clots on the left lung (pulmonary embolism). Upon several questions asked by the health care team, the doctors at the Hospital stated that the main cause of the blood cloths was the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine due to my healthy status and being the only thing that I had completed different in the days prior to the hospitalization. Due to this I was prescribed a 3 month anti coagulant treatment for the embolism.

I was immediately monitored and administered a normal dose of Benadryl where I waited upwards of 1 hour for the symptoms to wear off. All remaining minor symptoms were gone by next day. I&#39;ve developed pin-pointed neck pain limiting my range of motion within 2 days after the injection. Pain still persists today. No other symptoms. PCP recommended against getting the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

Woke up the next day with mild to severe body aches, muscle soreness, joint pain and pain in my stomach/abdomen. Developed a 101 fever 24 hrs after receiving the vaccine, and continued until this morning (3/16). Vomiting multiple times in the middle of the night on 3/14. The vomiting was only a one night deal, but every other symptom that I experienced has been persistent until this morning. I feel about 80% back at the moment. Symptoms were very similar, maybe even a little more extreme, than the ones I experienced when I contracted Covid months ago, but they didn?t last as long.

                                                On 4/19 he received the first dose of Pfizer vaccine oh 4 PM.  Administration of vaccine was uneventful.  The next day he noticed sore shoulder at 3 PM on 4/20 he noted he had upper wrist pain that progressed to his right thumb as well as redness with a shiny quality that was consistent with previous gout flares so he took 2 doses of colchicine and 2 doses of Advil which did not relieve his symptoms.  A couple hours later he noted hand numbness and tingling as well as feet numbness and tingling bilaterally.  The numbness progressed to his extremities with the left arm more affected than the right arm (he received vaccine in his left arm).  He had accompanied pain of his extremities and wrists that was described as 10 out of 10.  He then felt 2 episodes of chest tightness and difficulty breathing prompting him to present to the strong ED.  In the ED his exam was notable for hypertension (240/90), tachycardia, wrist flexion in distress and yelling in pain.  His exam also showed bilateral hyperflexion of bilateral wrist with mild swelling and diminished sensation and motor function throughout.  He was administered IV hydromorphone, and Benadryl with dramatic improvement in his symptoms.  His labs are notable for abnormal electrolytes including magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium and he was repleted with magnesium potassium and phosphorus.  He is admitted to ED OBS. overall felt his symptoms were most likely due to gout flare and hyperventilation, not likely related to vaccine.

Within the next 24 hours, I started having myalgia and Paresthesia to my right leg and foot on 1/5/21, this progressively worsened. On the 6th January, the paresthesia worsened and started to occur on the left foot- anterior and dorsal surfaces. In addition, at about 21:45hrs, I started having lower back pain- severe, rated about 6/10 in severity. This progressively worsened to 10/10 in pain severity. On the 7th an, all my symptoms had worsened, despite taking Tylenol. On the 8th January 2021, I started having difficulty lifting my right foot and visited emergency room for further care. At that time I have had a series of investigations and lab work done, in addition to PCP and specialist referral including Neurologist, Physiatrist and for Physical therapy. I am still undergoing physical therapy with improvement in the weakness but I still have persistent and on going lower back pain and paresthesia in my legs and foot three months later.

These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

                                                Woke up 2 days after vaccine and had tingling pins and needles throughout all my extremities. Massive tension headache and pressure behind eyes and sinus that has lasted so far for 3 weeks, tinnitus, blurred vision, joint pain, muscle weakness, muscle twitching in face and throughout body, numbness in all my limbs, burning sensations on my neck and back, stomach pain, and heart palpitations that sent me to the ER. When I walk and move my arms I feel weak. The vaccine has effected my nervous system in a terrible way. The ER doctor, ENT, PCP, Optometrist, and Opthamologist told me it was inflammation due to the vaccine. I was prescribed 6 days prednisone, 40mg for 2 days then taper down and they put me in a &#34;let&#39;s wait and see&#34; mode. All symptoms have persisted since. I follow-up with a cardiologist on 05/14/2021 and waiting appt for a neuro ophthalmologist.

This developed into muscle soreness as I sat through the waiting period before leaving the facility.  (For this reason, I had taken acetaminophen at about 8:30 that morning.)  I experienced both of these symptoms after my first shot of this COVID-19 vaccine, so these did not concern me.  After taking a nap back at my house, I woke up about 3:30 p.m. experiencing some partial numbness in my left arm, which received the injection.  It was not inhibitive, but I can somewhat relate it to the neuropathy my mother experienced before being diagnosed with diabetes in 2005.  It was a bit like the tingling I first experienced after the injection, but throughout the injected arm.  As I continued through that afternoon and evening, my arm kept getting stiffer and stiffer.  This prompted me to take my temperature at about 8 p.m. and then again at 10 p.m. Both of these tests resulted in a normal temperature of 98.3 or 98.4 degrees.  By the time I was about to climb into bed at midnight, the stiffness had spread to my shoulder joint -- such that almost any movement of that arm elicited some mild discomfort, especially if I leaned against the wall with that shoulder or raised my arm above my head.  I took a third dose of acetaminophen.  My normal prone sleeping position was not comfortable with this stiffness, so I did my best to sleep on my back.  Next, I woke up too hot about 3:30 a.m. (Wednesday, May 26) and could not get back to sleep.  Full-body chills set in soon after, prompting me to turn off my ceiling fan.  I faced some mild nausea as I attempted to get comfortable in bed again.  I suspected I was feverish by at least 4 a.m., but I did not get up to check my temperature until 5 a.m. The thermometer gave a reading of 100.3 degrees, so I took another dose of acetaminophen (my fourth in 24 hours) and tried to go back to sleep.

                                                Within a minute or less of receiving the shot, I experienced a rapid and intense onset of blurred vision, lightheadedness, profuse sweating, and extreme numbness all over but especially in my hands and feet. I came close to losing consciousness and was instructed to lay down with my knees bent to increase blood flow. I slowly came to over the course of probably 10 minutes while laying on the ground, but my hands and especially my fingers remained numb for 30-45 minutes while I experienced chills. My left hand and fingers were extremely pale and bluish during this time. I also had minor pains on the left side of my neck and left shoulder blade. Color came back to my left hand and chills subsided around an hour after my shot.

                                                Pain in jaw, head, neck, shoulders, and lower back. Started May 30. Not an injury from trauma. Not from overexertion. Back and shoulder pain subsided about about 5 days, but neck pain and headache continued through Tuesday, June 8. Treated with Ibuprofen and Tylenol with little effect. Went to the emergency room on June 2 at the advice of a physician. No apparent cause. I was given a strong anti-inflammatory that eased the pain slightly. The pain was about 5-6/10 for the duration of the event. Relief only came with a full-body massage from a licensed massage therapist. Still suffering from some jaw pain and minor headache.

Dose 2 - I had very severe body wide nerve pain, vertigo, terrible migraines, vision issues, confusion, short term memory loss and grasping for words and increased muscle weakness. It kind of mirrored a stroke. The pain was a 10/10. It was basically like all of my symptoms were getting progressively worse over the weeks. It&#39;s gotten better, but the symptoms are definitely still there. My neurologist increased the dosage of a few of my meds. At this time, they&#39;re basically managing my symptoms, but we do not have a definite source for the issue. However, the vaccine definitely caused the flare up because nothing else in my life has changed.

This pain was subsequently replaced over the ensuing days and weeks with progressive weakness, reflex changes, and sensory abnormalities in shoulder girdle musculature and proximal upper limb. The progressive neurologic deficits of motor weakness, dysesthesias, and numbness have persisted.  Subsequent tests (MRIs and EMGs) have been ordered to confirm and/or rule out possible causes of the event.

                                                After first shot there was minimal effects, just a sore arm and fatigue.  These went away within a day or so.   Second shot had immedate fatigue, body aches, and headache within 12 hours.  Again these subsided within 48 hours.  However within the week I developed a mild red rash across my body from my chest down to my knees, and an ache in my left ankle.  I assumed I had twisted the ankle without realizing and the rash had to do with my seasonal allergies.  I began taking Benadryl for the rash and rested the ankle, but the rash only slightly faded and while the ankle got slightly better, the ache moved to my right shoulder, then my  left elbow, then the left knee, then right knee, then to the joints in fingers on my right hand.   Finally mos recently the ache has moved to joints in the left hand.  Each time the aches move the previous location feels slightly better but isn&#39;t back up to 100 percent.  And aches seem to move every 4/5 days.   It has now been over a month since the second shot and the joints of my body still feels abnormal and strained.  And in the last few days I have developed a terrible headache that doesn&#39;t seem to go away.

A 31-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EW0178) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Right on 19Jun2021 15:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing substance use. Concomitant medication(s) included hydrocodone and unspecified antibiotics taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EN5318) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Right on 20May2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient experienced worst fever he can imagine, pulp in his arm, chills all over on 19Jun2021, extreme pain on 20Jun2021, couldn&#39;t taste cheetos on 22Jun2021, numbness, he thought his body went into shock, almost died, brain stating out/ his brain goes fuzzy, gutting his stomach, ribs were sore on Jun2021. Caller reported as he got the second Covid Vaccine in his arm. He literally almost died. He went to (withheld), and they said it is normal and he should take some Tylenol. If he can die it is not normal. The hospital didn&#39;t want to do anything because they were afraid people would use him as a scapegoat and say if he is incapacitated, they will never take it. He had a bad dose or just had a severe adverse reaction. He had his vaccination card on him. It didn&#39;t happen until he had his second dose. He had been shot in the face with a 357 Magnum at point blank range, and this is more painful than that. It is legit more painful. He has never felt worse pain in his entire life. His card says Pfizer Vaccine EW0178. Maybe he got a bad dose. Right now, he has to be careful to not sit in one position because he was very uncomfortable. Further reporter stated briefly extreme pain: They gave him the shot and he went to sleep, and his body was immediately super tender and painful. He thought his body went into shock. He was shot in the face by a 357 Magnum so he knows the feeling. It started at 0000. In the morning he woke up and tried to eat food and couldn&#39;t taste Cheetos. He tried to go to the bathroom and peed on his leg twice, he was that kind of numb. The real pain came from trying to just exist. He was so tender that breathing was an obstacle and touching a pillow against his skin felt like getting hit by a bus for the next couple days. He still doesn&#39;t feel all that great. He needs antibiotics and a painkiller. He was smoking marijuana because everyone left him in the cold. Pulp in his arm: He could feel like a pulp in his arm where it was worse. It felt like a bullet was put into his arm. It was all pulpy and feels nasty. It was dispersants of coagulation and blood or the medicine and blood or something else. Either way it is gross. He put his hand against it and massaged it and it hurt like hell. The pain subsided. It was like he has PTSD. He had to get that out of his arm. When he gets the pulpy stuff out of his arm the dispersing pain was less and less, but it was still super painful. That was how he woke up initially. It was there only slightly now. Brain stat icing out: He also keeps having his brain static-ing out which was not a good thing. His brain goes fuzzy. He has had no medical tests. The clinical outcome of the events Numbness, worst fever he can imagine, pulp in his arm, brain stating out/ his brain goes fuzzy was recovering and other were not recovered.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. The patient experienced swelling in left arm/thumb and numbness from tip of thumb to joint on opposite limb of administration.  Since Wednesday, 23Dec2020, he has been experiencing some numbness in the arm opposite of where the vaccine was administered. He clarifies the vaccine was administered in the deltoid of his right arm, and the numbness he is experiencing is in his left hand. His thumb has been partially numb since last Wednesday. He got a little bit of tingling in his left arm since last Wednesday (23Dec2020).The patient explains on Tuesday, 22Dec2020, when he was administered the vaccine he only had typical side effects that went away within 24 hours. He experienced headache and muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was administered. Both of these symptoms went away and he has recovered completely. After 24-36 hours, he noticed numbness on hand opposite of the arm where the vaccine was administered. His thumb has been partially numb which has lasted about 6 days. He clarifies the numbness is on the palm side- which he was told was not related to the nerve. His thumb looks swollen and inflamed compared to the other. He also has noticed muscle weakness in the opposite arm. The patient states he can&#39;t recall if the numbness occurred within 24 hours but he knows by 24 hours, he did have the numbness. His thumb is partially numb on the side of the palm and up to the middle of his thumb where the joint is.Patient states yesterday the numbness was noticeably worse when he was sleeping. However, today the numbness seems to be back where it was before. He forgets about the numbness since he is not actively doing anything with that particular hand, but he doesn&#39;t forget about it completely. The numbness hasn&#39;t improved any, it&#39;s been consistently there and never went away. While reading off of his card, the patient cannot determine if the Lot number is an F or an E because the number is underlined. He thinks it might be an E. Patient was able to confirm the Lot number begins with an E after looking at the information sheet he was provided. He also sees the product number, CVX 208. Patient states he has no allergic reactions and nothing that he knows of that is an underlying condition. Patient states he hasn&#39;t had any testing done in regards to these events. He wanted to talk to the manufacturer and report it to the (Contact center name) first before he schedules something at Urgent Care. He wanted to check and see if what he is experiencing is a lesser known symptom. He couldn&#39;t find this information anywhere. The outcome of events, headache and muscle soreness was recovered on 23Dec2020. The outcome of Numbness in hand was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

                                                Following the first COVID vaccine dose on Dec/18/2020, I had headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day.  The headaches were usually light, unilateral, and alternating from one side to the other. I was usually functional except on the fourth and seventh days where the headaches were moderate to severe, and I took naps to help with the headaches for those two days. I have never had an issue with headaches before, and these symptoms were a new experience for me. I did not take any medications as treatment for the headaches. Following the second COVID vaccine dose on January/7/2021, I felt fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On January/10/2021, when I woke up that morning I again felt light, unilateral, and alternating headaches. In addition, I noticed that I was unable to move the left side of my face. I felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When I looked in the mirror, I could quite noticeably see asymmetry in my face. I immediately went to the emergency department at the hospital where my primary care doctor is located. I was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation. After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, I was provided with the diagnosis of Bells Palsy. I have never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and I have never previously had a hospital stay before. The doctors prescribed medications which I am currently taking. As of today January/12/2021, the symptoms have had some improvement, but the symptoms still continue.

At about 8:30PM, I started to get chills and started to have muscle soreness all throughout my body (shoulders, arms, back, legs, abdomen, etc.). I went to bed at about 11:30PM with the soreness and chills. I woke up at about 7AM and the chills had resolved. The muscles soreness and now a headache remained up until about 5:30PM on Saturday 1/9/21. After that, I felt right back to normal.

A 32-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3246) on 07Jan2021 at 09:00 a.m. intramuscular on left deltoid, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included omeprazole. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 at 09:00 on left arm (lot number: EK5730) and experienced headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day. Following the second dose on 07Jan2021, patient experienced fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On 10Jan2021, he noticed that was unable to move the left side of his face. He felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When looked in the mirror, he could quite noticeably see asymmetry in his face. Patient immediately visited emergency department at the hospital where his primary care doctor was located. Patient was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation (as reported). After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, patient was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He had never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and never previously had a hospital stay before. It was also informed that patient underwent Nasal Swab for SARS-CoV-2 test on an unspecified date in Dec2020 and on 10Jan2021, both resulted negative. At the time of the reporting, the symptoms continued.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of diagnosed Bells Palsy presented as unable to move the left side of his face/felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis/asymmetry in his face cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Started around 3:00AM the night of the vaccine and lasted about 32 hours.  I also experienced severe headache, restlessness, a 100.4-101.0 F fever lasting about 16 hours from 3:00 am of the night of vaccine.    I did not take any medications.  Side effects resolved on their own.

                                                About two weeks after first shot, I got shingles. It could be unrelated, but since I&#39;m young, perfectly healthy, not abnormally stressed, and haven&#39;t ever had singles before, I thought there might be a chance it is related. I&#39;ve seen online other young people who are saying that they got shingles after the first shot of Moderna or Pfizer.  Maybe it was just a coincidence, but I figured it was worth reporting. It is overall a pretty mild case because I got on the antiviral drugs pretty quickly. Wondering if I should still get my second shot on schedule or wait until my shingles is all cleared. I have asked my doctor and am awaiting a response. I first noticed the symptoms on Saturday (3/20) exactly two weeks after my first shot.

I tried to sleep and woke up at 2 am with worsening lower back pain with pain into my flanks and hips bilaterally that was burning in nature and now rated an 8/10. The back pain and right flank pain persisted into the following day and evening. I woke at 3am on Monday morning and was drenched from sweating. At that time I noticed my back pain was 75% better. As I woke in the morning at 7am it was 80% better. I still have some residual central back and right flank pain but it is manageable. At a 3/10.

                                                Approximately 9 days after injection in left arm, started experiencing symptoms in right armpit consistent with swollen lymph nodes including: intermittent sharp stinging pain similar to ingrown hair or inflamed hair follicle, as well redness and dull pain upon palpation. Over several days, swelling has increased significantly and pain has increased a little as well. Today, 14 days after injection in left arm, starting to experience onset of lymph node swelling in left armpit as well. Additionally, starting 9 days after injection, concomitant with lymph node swelling, I believe I have felt slightly fatigued and have felt 1 degree warmer than usual, though not actually feverish. I confirmed a temperature of 98.9F today around 5:45PM, whereas my normal temperature is about 97.7F when measured by the same method.

                                                Developed a medium size knot where shot was given that was hard and sore to the touch.  Then also developed the same thing up on my collar bone area (may be a lymph node) that is more sensitive to the touch than my arm.  Makes me arm feel somewhat numb and harder to grip at times.

                                                On April 6 a.m. developed fewer-like symptoms with muscle pain typical foe fewer with these symptoms steadily worsening by evening. Night shower at appr. 9 p.m. caused a feeling of spinal nerve pinch followed by acute pain during certain movements and breathing. Following day (Wednesday) spent in bed taking Ibuprophene thinking is just a nerve pinch. Called virtual appointment tele doctor who prescribed Katorolac which I took from Wednesday night to Thursday morning per prescription with no effects. On Thursday evening called tele doctor again and got Ibuprophene 800 mg prescription. It helped for 20-30 min only. Same evening coughed some blood. On Friday kept taking Ibuprophene for very temporary relieve. On Saturday April 10 was admitted to hospital and was hospitalized with blood cloth diagnosis for 4 days.

At 3:57 PM, the pt came to the Observation desk, and stated, &#34;I don&#39;t feel right.  I feel like I&#39;m going to pass out.&#34;  Observation crew assisted the pt to the chair.  The pt went completely &#34;stiff&#34;.  The pt was caught by Observation crew and did not fall to the floor.  During this state, the pt had what sounded like snoring respirations.

He said between 10;30am and 11:00am his vision became blurred.  At 2:30pm when patient called to make report he was still experiencing blurred vision. I strongly urged him to go to ER for evaluation or call his PCP ASAP.  He verbalized understanding.

A 32-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 06Mar2021 09:45 (lot number: EN6205) at the age of 32 years old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medication included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Initially the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, his diagnosis was changed to rare reaction to a vaccine as per ER report in the hospital. They changed the diagnosis because it was not only his face drooping (reported as drooling) but he did not have a knee reflex or any feeling in his hands, and severe muscle pain all over his body to the extent he can&#39;t move. At the hospital they excluded Lyme disease by blood work and stroke and spinal infection by spinal tapping. Then he was discharged. All events occurred on 12Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. AEs resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab (COVID-19 PCR test): negative on 13Mar2021; and on unspecified date, blood work which excluded Lyme disease and stroke and spinal tapping which excluded spinal infection. Corticosteroid was given as treatment for the events. The patient has not recovered from the events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and an implied temporal association, the reported events are considered possibly related to BNT162B2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                72 hours after receiving my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed a pain on the right side of my neck, which then led to a headache on the back right side of my head.  I began seeing black spots in my vision, which then developed into kaleidoscope vision affecting both eyes but in my left field of view.  I took ibuprofen and laid down with a cold compress.  The vision issues lasted for approximately 30 minutes.  The headache and neck pain persisted until the next morning which was accompanied by vertigo.  I then decided to go to the ER and was diagnosed with a migraine with aura.  I have never experienced a migraine or visual problems before.  The doctor at the ER recommended I make this report in case my symptoms are linked to the vaccine.

                                                rhabdomyolysis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 32-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 02Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient stated, &#34;These symptoms could be unrelated to the vaccine, but I believe they are worth reporting as they occurred after the vaccination.&#34; On 16Apr2021, the patient experienced rhabdomyolysis and currently have ongoing muscle pain. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization for 1 day. The outcome of the events was not recovered. No treatment was given to the patient for the events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient remained sitting and resting for about 20 mins during this time we offered to call 911 to which the patients wife stated that something similar to this happened before and declined the call to 911.

                                                I felt very lightheaded and woozy roughly 5 minutes after injection. I was found passed out on the bathroom floor shortly after, with no recollection of entering the bathroom. It was estimated I was out for a couple minutes. I personally wondered if it caused blood pressure to drop, but I had no way to test it and was more focused on sitting up at the time. I stayed in the waiting area until I was confident I was able to walk on my own. A second wave, though less intense, happened roughly 30-45 minutes after the first. I left the store after 2 hours with fatigue, arm pain, and the hand of the opposite arm shaking on its own. The hand stopped shaking roughly 3 hours after the injection.  Fatigue was mostly gone in a day. I could not raise my arm above chest height without pain the 1st day. Today is day two and I can raise it up properly again with mild stiffness and slight twinges of pain.

                                                I received the COVID-19 vaccine at 9:30 am from vaccination clinic. I had just recovered from COVID-19 about two and a half weeks prior. I had no immediate reaction. I worked the entire day with no adverse effects other than a sore arm, which I expected. Later in the day at about 7:45 pm I went for a 6 mile run and got home at approximately 8:49 pm. Within half an hour of getting home, I quickly became feverish. The fever continued to rise until I was extremely hot, and hotter than I can ever remember as an adult or child. I did not have access to a thermometer so I cannot reliably report what the temperature was but I am estimating 103. It felt like every part of my body, including my legs, was hot to the touch. By 1 am I had serious chills and was shivering under winter blankets despite an outdoor temperature of 70-80. In addition, I had an extremely elevated heart rate and chest pain. I also had generalized muscle aches all over my body.  I did not sleep at all that night. The fever began to slowly dissipate early in the morning but the elevated heart rate continued for approximately 24 hours. The discomfort resulting from my elevated heart rate was substantial and alarming enough that I sought advice from my primary care physician after a nurse at my Occupational Health clinic suggested potentially getting an ECG. Ultimately, by Thursday morning, the symptoms had decreased and I declined any follow up. However, this was the single worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to any vaccine and the single worst fever I&#39;ve ever experienced as an adult or in my memory as a child. Although I am aware that people who have already had COVID-19 tend to have worse reactions to the first COVID vaccine, I am filing this report primarily because of my concern that exercise may trigger an especially severe reaction.

                                                Severe back and leg pain began after doing daily stretches on 3/26.  MRI determined that the minor herniation had ruptured and caused an extrusion.  A surgical microdiscectomy was necessary to remove the extrusion.

                                                I received the first covid vaccination in May 5th and a week or so later started getting tingling in my toes that would come and go.  I did not tie it to the vaccine at first as it was not a listed side effect I saw.  On 5/26/2021 I received the second shot and the tingling spread to more of my toes, and then into my hands a few days later.  After another few days my legs became very weak and I went into the Emergency Room where they diagnosed me with Guillain-Barre and my symptoms continued to worsen where I lost all my reflexes and ability to walk as usual

                                                First of all, does anyone care? Will anyone contact me? I doubt it. That being said, my level of exhaustion since the shot is INSANE. I can barely walk 5 blocks, the more I walk the more tired and heavy my legs feel. I can barely keep my arms up for extended periods. I went to Physical Therapy and my therapist there tried to test the reflexes in my legs and I had NONE. That has never happened to me before. This is because of the vaccine. It?s been a week and it?s only getting worse not better. I almost don?t have the energy in my hands to write this much. Who is going to contact me? Is this going to get better? The gov?t is coercing people to take a vaccine and I want to know who is going to care when it affects me this badly!? Seriously. It?s quite sad. I keep filling this things out and no one contacts me. Should I wait? Go to ER? My doctor doesn?t seem to care much because everyone blindly thinks this vaccine is safe. I?m worried and confused. Thanks for whoever actually read this. I am sure I won?t be contacted.

A 32-year-old male patient (age at vaccination: 32 year) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0217 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Deltoid Left (upper arm), on 03Jun2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at Pharmacy. The patient&#39;s medical history included dysautonomia (he was born with it) and herniated disc. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (GOODY&#39;S) (powder for headache or something like that, or back pain powder, in the week or 2 before the vaccine. It was like a pain powder that comes in a little pouch instead of actual pill like Tylenol. No further information provided). There was no family medical history relevant to adverse events. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0182 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Deltoid Left (upper arm), on 14May2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at Pharmacy and no reaction on previous exposure to vaccine. The patient did not receive any vaccine within 4 weeks prior vaccinations, he had never even had the flus shot before. He had never even had the flu either. Investigation assessment was not done. The patient stated he was calling regarding the Pfizer Covid vaccine. He got the second shot 03Jun2021, about 2 weeks ago. The back side of his left leg was completely numb from the whole left butt cheek down to his knee and it has been since he got the second shot. Also, his left arm felt the same, kind of like he has been holding it over his head for a long time, it felt kind of numb, but not really, but kind of heavy. This probably wasn&#39;t a common thing, so he wanted to report it. He had some other side effects, but he wanted to give it a little more time to make sure it didn&#39;t go away. The patient&#39;s left leg numb from the whole left butt cheek down to his knee which started within the next day or 2 and it hadn&#39;t gone away. It felt about the same. It felt like it fell asleep, the whole back side area. It was like holding the arm above the head too long where it loses a little blood. It felt kind of cold and stiff and felt a little heavy. It started around the same time as the numbness in the leg, but it may have taken a little bit to notice because he did have the fatigue and was sleeping a lot the first couple days. That might have been why it took a couple of days to really notice what was going on with his arm. It was after the second dose and lasted a couple of days. It has stayed the same. Numbness was 2 inches higher where he has a herniated disc. The patient&#39;s had pain from the shot at the injection site on 03Jun2021, which was normal and went away, the heaviness of the arm was still there and was just right at the injection site. It didn&#39;t feel any worse than a tetanus shot. It was kind of a longer needle and all, so he expected that to be normal anyway. The soreness went away the second day. The adverse events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. No relevant tests were performed. The patient did not receive any treatment. When asked if he had any other concerns, patient stated, not unless Pfizer was going to help with the copay for going to the doctor and clarified that this was not an actual request, says he was joking. Outcome of the event pain from the shot at the injection site was recovered on 04Jun2021 and for the events fatigue and was sleeping a lot it was reported as unknown and for all other events, it was not recovered.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                I sat in a chair after I received the vaccine. After 10 minutes I stood up and my legs were tingling and felt heavy.  I was slightly lightheaded too. I sat back down for a few more minutes and then I went back to work. The the tingling stopped but my legs felt heavy for 3 days. I am feeling normal now. I am aware of orthostatic hypotension and the possibility of it being from sitting in the chair and pinching nerves. I just wanted to report this in case it is a problem.

I am a pharmacist with a healthcare system and they have been offering the Pfizer/Biontech COVID-19 vaccine for essential associates. I received by first dose of vaccine on 12/31/20. On 1/1/20 I woke up with very noticeable muscle aches and fairly profound lethargy, which last 18-20 hours. I was not able to do much on 1/1/21 because of the way I was feeling. I&#39;m not sure if this reaction is normal for patients who receive their COVID-19 vaccine close to their illness/infection with COVID-19, which is why I&#39;m reporting this to the FDA.

The headache grew stronger and I was relatively useless, feeling very ill. By the next day the 16th most of the symptoms had cleared up. I had a slight headache and felt a bit tired, but much better. By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

                                                While driving home in traffic from getting the vaccine, I felt a tingling over my whole body and then everything started to spin (vertigo). This lasted for about 10 seconds of severe vertigo and then stopped. I thought that was weird and kept driving (was in stop and go traffic) then about 1 minute later it started again and thankfully I was stopped at the time in traffic. I leaned my  seat back slightly and called my wife to tell her where I am. I couldn&#39;t pull over because there was a cement barrier on one side and 4 lanes of traffic on the other. I kept on the phone with her for the remained of my drive and it occurred one more time when I was driving home. Once home, a couple more times I felt it coming on but it didn&#39;t ever happen again. I took my blood pressure and it was normal, boarderline high when I got home (140/84). The next morning I had a fever and severe muscle aches and body aches which lasted most of the day and then today I&#39;ve felt totally fine (today being 1/23).

                                                About an hour after I received my second shot I felt extremely hot and my knees and elbows started to hurt. I felt so hot that I walked outside to my car (about .3 miles away) in freezing cold temperatures with no jacket and didn&#39;t feel the cold at all. I developed a brain fog shortly thereafter and made several mistakes while performing my job throughout the day. My supervisor provided me with extra strength tylenol and within an hour or so the joint pains subsided. By 7 PM that night I had very bad chills and was shaking under a blanket on my couch. My temperature got up to 99.8 which is pretty high for me. I went back and forth between  feeling like I was freezing cold and on fire.  I got very little sleep that night and had disturbing dreams. The following morning all my joints hurt and I felt extreme exhaustion. I laid on my couch all day the day after receiving the shot and felt exhausted and and had no appetite. From 6 PM the day of the shot to 9 PM the following day I ate NOTHING and had no desire to eat. As I&#39;m typing this 60 hours after receiving the second shot the joint pain is  gone, the exhaustion is gone and my appetite is back to normal. There&#39;s a lingering pain at the injection site but otherwise I feel like I did prior to receiving the second shot.

                                                Shooting arm pain in right shoulder began 1/23/21 around 11AM and continued for most of the afternoon. 1/24/21 around noon it came back. Monday 1/25 it was getting worse and just began to feel like I tried to lift entirely too much weight for a long time but I hadn&#39;t done anything. Tuesday 1/26 the pain was all but gone but returned and was worse on 1/27 and 1/28. On 1/29 it subsided again and I felt fine but on 1/30 and 1/31 it came back with a vengeance and hurt all day on both of those days.  On Monday 2/1 it was back to just being sore again and has been the same soreness on 2/2 and 2/3. No more shooting pain just lingering soreness.

                                                Starting Monday February 22 (six days after second dose), I experienced moderate muscle cramping and soreness in the back of the neck, lower back, and buttocks/legs. I am also experiencing headache, dizziness, and diarrhea, all moderate. Symptoms are temporarily relieved by massage and stretching, but pain is still ongoing. This has persisted until today (Thursday, February 25).

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had no known allergies. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination.  On 21Mar2021 at 07:30 PM, after receiving his first dose, he began noticing facial drooping, which began to intensify, on the right side. He was advised by a medical professional to immediately call an ambulance and he was then taken to an emergency room where received a CT scan and full bloodwork on Mar2021. Luckily, the facial palsy began to subside and he was able to return home after the test results came back and a stroke was ruled out - it was stated that this was some kind of immuno-reaction to the vaccine. He still felt as though his face was still not 100% back to normal and still felt a bit droopy (noticeable in the mirror) yet it does feel better than on 21Mar2021 evening. Patient had a nasal swab on 22Mar2021 with negative result. One of the reporters is a psychologist and reported that her son received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Psychologist asking about risk of Bell&#39;s palsy, incidence, and outcomes and if these patients received their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. She read about 7 cases of Bell&#39;s palsy in a Dec2020 article in the [Redacted], 4 of them on the Pfizer vaccine. The reporter further clarified and described that at 6pm (2 hours after dose), patient reported he felt fine and was happy he got the vaccine; but then sometime after that, he reported &#34;strange feelings in face&#34; and then eyes started drooping and then mouth started drooping, all on right side of face. They called the university clinic and was instructed to go to ER. Brain scans and blood work were done; they ruled out stroke and said it was a possible reaction to the vaccine. He was discharged at midnight and by then, paralysis was 80-85% resolved. He is an otherwise very healthy young man. The psychologist wanted to know the efficacy after just one dose and stated that a friend suggested to perhaps not get second dose and consider getting a dose of the non mRNA vaccine like Johnson and Johnson.  The outcome of the event was recovering.   Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                I began experiencing severe neck pain the morning after I received my first vaccine. The first morning, the pain was so intense that I was unable to lift my head out of bed and consequently had to lift the back of my neck with one hand to sit up in bed. I?d never experienced this kind of neck pain before.  The pain level was equally intense over the next several days until I started taking ibuprofen . I even went to the chiropractor to receive an adjustment to help reduce the pain. However, as of today,  I am still experiencing significant neck pain that is effecting my activities of daily living.

                                                I got shingles about one month after the second dose. I had severe pain around my spine and back on Friday (4/23/2021) and by the next morning developed red bumps on the left side of my nose that I at first mistook for acne. They produced a very tiny amount of white liquid secretion. The bumps turned darker and I got a red rash on the left side of my nose. The left side of my face as well as the lymph nodes around my collar area swelled up. By Tuesday morning, it spread to my left eye, so I went to the ER where they started me on two new antibiotics. After none of the antibiotics worked, I started an antiviral (acyclovir) and antiviral eye drops and started to improve. The rash and swelling reduced and no new blisters have formed. The doctor and I both thought it likely I had shingles.

EKG, blood work, and chest x-rays were taken.  All came back clear.  Blood pressure was 162/96.  Chest pain was deemed to be musculoskelatal.  Took blood pressure readings 2 days later and it was 155/90.  Took regular readings over the following 3 days and it averaged 150/85.  Blood pressure remains high and general practitioner will try low dose blood pressure medications.

Patient did not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 26Jan2021 06:00, patient experienced severe joint pain and body aches, diarrhea and headache. Patient did not received any treatment for the adverse event. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He has to hold on to walls to walk.; Patient started to get terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness.; patient cannot walk; Severe back pain; both feet have numbness and tingling; This is a spontaneous report from Pfizer. A contactable nurse (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 33-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 13Apr2021 13:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0153) (at the age of 33 years old) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included surgery on his leg (when he was 17) and cold. There were no concomitant medications. Patient had a severe reaction to the covid vaccine. On 17Apr2021 at 08:00, the patient had severe back pain. On Sunday morning (25Apr2021), patient had severe back pain. Patient was a former college athlete. Patient was mentally healthy and physically fit. Patient did not remember getting hurt while playing golf. Patient iced his back and did some stretches. Patient called his friend who is a doctor, and his friend told him he did the right thing by icing and stretching.  A few days later, either Tuesday evening, 27Apr2021 or Wednesday, 28Apr2021, patient started to get terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness. Patient was able to get down a flight of stairs and then called an uber. Patient was taken to the hospital. It was his left foot and left leg initially. Now both feet have numbness and tingling. It was hard for him to walk. He has to hold on to walls to walk (also reported as Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness. Patient cannot walk. Patient can now only stand if he is holding a wall).  He went to the emergency department on 29Apr2021 and got an MRI of back and lower legs, &#34;all was negative for slip disc or spinal cord swelling.  Patient had an MRI of his lower back, and legs. The MRI results were that patient had no spinal cord compression that would cause his left lower leg numbness. Patient was admitted to the hospital, to the neurology department, with a consult for a neurosurgeon to see him. The doctors agreed that he had something going on since he had left lower leg numbness. In the course of four days, Thursday through Sunday, patient was admitted to hospital in the neurology unit. Patient was in an overflow area. Several hospitals around that area have closed, so now the hospital is seeing so many more patients, and the hospital is over capacity. Patient was admitted by a hospitalist, and then was referred to a neurology team. The doctors said that that does not explain patient&#39;s symptoms, so the doctors ordered a head to toe MRI with contrast.  He was admitted to the hospital and continued to have severe back pain then, the doctors did another head to toe MRI with contrast and then they said he has &#34;MS due to brain lesions and spinal cord swelling the length of his spinal cord.&#34; They also did a spinal tap. The family kept telling the MDs that he had just received his Pfizer vaccine. The patient denies any weakness or numbness in past 6 months. He continues to have numbness in both feet and now the left leg is always numb. The doctors gave him an outpatient appt at the end of June. It felt like whenever he sits on his foot while watching TV, and it starts going numb. By the time that patient was getting testing done, the nurses covered patient&#39;s eyes, and told patient to tell them whenever he could feel it. The doctors and nurses were sticking pens in patient&#39;s feet, and patient could not feel it at all. Patient could only feel pressure. On Friday, 30Apr2021, patient had a head to toe MRI with contrast. Reporter thinks that patient got back to his room after the total body MRI about 22:15. The head to toe MRI with contrast revealed that patient had spinal cord swelling, and lesions in the brain. Doctors diagnosed patient with multiple sclerosis. Patient has never had any symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Reporter&#39;s husband feels like patient could have transverse myelitis, because some vaccines can cause that. Reporter&#39;s husband asked patient&#39;s doctor to contact Pfizer to see if there was anything in place about how to treat this. On Thursday, patient&#39;s doctor told reporter&#39;s husband that there had been no reported adverse effects of spinal cord swelling from the covid vaccine. On Sunday, whenever patient was discharged, patient&#39;s doctor told reporter&#39;s husband that he was not going to call and report about patient to Pfizer, and that there had already been 45 documented cases. This was a really big red flag to reporter. Patient cannot walk. Patient can now only stand if he is holding a wall. Before this, he was totally healthy. Patient was discharged from the hospital on Sunday. The hospital sent his MRI results, lab work, and spinal tap fluid after his MRI to Clinic. The doctors did the spinal tap on patient to make sure he did not have an infection. Patient did not have an infection. The doctor started patient on Lyrica and some other drug. The hospital told patient to call back in two weeks, because by then they would have stuff back from Clinic, and then he could make a follow up appointment. Upon discharge, patient was told that maybe he could get a follow up appointment in Jun2021. Everything that reporter has read, says that patient&#39;s condition needs to be followed up on as soon as possible. Patient cannot walk. This is going to financially cripple patient. Reporter is sure that after this, patient will meet his deductible and is going to have to pay out all of this money to cover his hospital stay and testing. Before the COVID vaccine, patient did not have any problems at all. Patient had to have surgery on his leg when he was 17. Patient has no history of back pain. By the time the doctors and nurses did testing, that was late Friday evening, 30Apr2021 or Saturday morning, 01May2021. By the time that the testing was done, both of patient&#39;s feet and left leg were totally numb. The hospital said that patient&#39;s symptoms were terrible, and that he had something acute going on. The hospital ran tests on patient. Patient told the doctors at the hospital that he had recently received the COVID vaccine. Patient was never sick he might get a cold every once in a while. Other than that, patient only sees the doctor once a year for a physical. The hospital did preliminary lab work on patient. Patient&#39;s vital signs were stable, and he had no fever.  After patient received three doses of IV Solu-Medrol, his back pain went away. Patient&#39;s doctors felt like patient&#39;s spinal cord swelling had diminished. Patient&#39;s doctors felt like patient&#39;s spinal cord swelling is what cause patient&#39;s numbness and tingling. The first dose of IV Solu-Medrol was given sometime on 30Apr2021. Patient received IV Solu-Medrol 1 gram, three days in a row.The doctors said that was all they were going to do at this time. The doctors wanted to wait to see what the lumbar puncture shows (unknown results). Patient was given IV Solu-Medrol while in the hospital. Patient was put on Lyrica and gabapentin. The doctors are hoping that those two medications will make his symptoms go away. Patient used to take a multivitamin for years, but reporter does not know if patient still takes that. Patient is super healthy. Patient was admitted to the hospital on 29Apr2021, and discharged on 02May2021 after receiving his last dose of IV Solu-Medrol. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had Nasal Swab (COVID test) on 28Apr2021 and was negative.  Event relatedness to Pfizer COVID vaccine: Severe back pain and Patient started to get terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness. Patient cannot walk. Patient can now only stand if he is holding a wall was related. Reporter stated that she thinks his symptoms are medically significant, but they could be disabling. If the COVID vaccine gave patient multiple sclerosis or transverse myelitis, this could be disabling. The outcome of the event back pain was recovered in May2021; event spinal cord swelling was recovering; events &#34;terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness and It was hard for him to walk. He has to hold on to walls to walk&#34; were not recovered; and unknown outcome for the other events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the multiple sclerosis,  transverse myelitis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.   There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including spinal MRI at baseline, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 33-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose  via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm on 17May2021 (late morning or early afternoon) at age of 33-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Medical history included the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 in May2021, 15 days before the patient received the vaccine, he was doing very well, it was a light case. There were no concomitant medications. There was no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. After vaccination, the patient was feeling much better afterwards and felt fine. The patient did not think too much of it. As the day went on, it got worse. The patient had a very serious reaction. The patient had a blood clot in the lungs on 18May2021 and was in the hospital. It was very scary. It was referring to the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. The patient received it in (withheld). 15 days before the patient received the vaccine, he did have COVID. The patient&#39;s doctor recommended it was ok to go back to work and to have the vaccine. The patient had the vaccine on 17May2021 and by 20May2021, he was in the hospital with blood clots in the lungs. The lung doctor was saying that the blood clot came from the vaccine. The patient had to take blood thinners for 3 months and they are concerned about the long term. The patient was in the hospital for 2 days, in (withheld) from 18May2021 to 20May2021. On 20May2021, the reporter brought the patient home. The patient was in so much pain, reporter took him back in the morning of 21May2021. For event blood clot, it had been 2 weeks. The patient went to work and came home on 18May2021 that day early from work, around 5:00 pm, having pain. The patient called the doctor who said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) and go to bed. By that evening around 10:00 pm, they ended up taking him to the hospital, where they said he had blood clots. His pain was in the upper part and on the side by his ribs, into the back. The reporter thought at first, it was more to the left but patient was in so much pain, she really could not tell. They said the patient had 2 blood clots, one was on each lung, but they were so small. The pain was so severe. They took the patient to the hospital and he was there 2 days. On 20May2021, they released the patient. When they went to get him on 20May2021, reporter noticed that something was wrong. They gave the patient medication, a prescription pain pill. By the morning of 21May2021, around 06:00, they took him back to the hospital. They did blood work and another CT scan, and said there was no change. When they finally got the patient back into the room, they gave him some type of injection to release the pain. The reporter literally had to call another hospital, who told her to call the nurse supervisor. The reporter was outside calling the nurse supervisor for the emergency room. Then, they said that someone would come out. It had to go that far. After that, when they gave the patient the shot, the pain did subside. When it started to ware off, they gave the patient pain medication. On 22May2021, the doctor called to check on the patient. The reporter was concerned they gave the patient the shot too soon. The doctor said that it would take a while for the medication to take effect. It felt like in his back, like the muscles were too tight and the pain was so bad. The reporter had asked about a muscle relaxer and was initially told to wait until 24May2021 but then ordered a muscle relaxer and it did seem to help some what. On 22May2021, the patient started to feel like there was not any pain and his breathing felt normal. Before that (May2021), the patient&#39;s breathing was not normal. It all started happening and could not even explain when. The event blood clots in the lungs required a visit to emergency room for twice, the first time, the patient was admitted to hospital. Treatment included pain medication or muscle relaxers, apixaban (ELIQUIS) after the blood clots. The outcome of blood clots in the lungs and muscles were too tight was unknown, the outcome of rest events was resolved on 22May2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

He had a COVID 19 test and he is expecting a call with the results and the staff at the hospital took his temperature. He explained to the hospital staff that he was having the symptoms that are on the COVID 19 vaccine paperwork and that was the reason for his visit, since he had the two COVID 19 vaccines. He would like to point out that he asked the nurse when he was going to have the second dose, since the first vaccine he was still having side effects, he asked her if he was in danger to have the second vaccine. The nurse told him he was ok to get the second vaccine. The nurse told him he might have some muscle pain but he shouldn&#39;t be worried about it. At the emergency room he also had some blood tests. And also they took his pulse and after that the doctor was reading something in English that the interpreter couldn&#39;t catch and read. He provided Pfizer with what happened so far since he had the vaccine. He wasn&#39;t able to stand up with the muscle pain and he couldn&#39;t support his legs any longer, all on 16Jun2021. He would like to know if he&#39;s going to get some help with the medical bills. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Blood test: negative, COVID-19 virus test: negative on 16Jun2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Tendonitis, debilitating neuralgias leading to 2.5 weeks of missed work  No issues immediately after injection.  About 12 hours later had severe arm pain limiting motion in L arm.  Slowly improved but never resolved.  Started to get worse again on day 7/8 with pain in deltoid, tricep, bicep, forearm.   Should pain on day 10 while in bed reaching for covers - limited ability to do normal task (lift arm to turn on turn signal).  No improvement with ibuprofen.  Right shoulder pain started the following day.  Was given medrol dose pack with some improvement for 2 days but bilateral shoulder pain worsened by day 2 of steroids.  Heard pop in Right groin while sliding in bed on day 3 of steroids.  Painful causing limping while walking for several days.  On 1/13/21, severe pain in groin when standing leading to ER visit (Xray negative).  MD described as tendonitis of adductor muscle.  Pain radiated down leg to knee and to hip.  The following day similar pains occurred in the left leg.  Pain &#34;bounced&#34; between bilateral upper and lower proximal muscles and tendons.  Had stiffening of R arm on 1/15/21 and 1/16/21 associated with numbness in hand.  Went to ED again.  inflammatory markers were negative.  ANA was positive for RNP antibodies but the titer was low.  rheumatoid factor low.  TSH normal.  ED MD said she would call it polymyalgia rheumatica but I was 40 years too young.  Bouncing severe neuralgia type pain lasted about 2 weeks.  It started to resolve with scheduled naproxen and daily physical therapy multiple times per day.  It&#39;s 2/13/21 and I am still taking NSAIDs and doing PT and have residual shoulder impingement with upward arm movements, have limited ability to lift objects that I previously could and also have difficulty standing for rounds (critical care clinical pharmacist).

                                                Almost immediately after I received my dose, I felt very dizzy and began sweating profusely. My vision became very blurry, and I had trouble breathing. No one came to check and see if I was ok. They just waved me out of the building, being terrified of what was going on and what wanting to leave the facility I drove out into the parking lot for the additional assessment. In the parking lot, I continued panting and sweating, feeling as though I was going to vomit. Again, no one checked on me, and I was too incapacitated to &#34;honk my horn 3 times.&#34; After the additional 15 minutes, they waved everyone through to leave, so I left. There was no professional around to speak with at this point anyways. Covered in sweat and dizzy. I drove home to go to bed.  When I got home about 10 minutes later, my arm where I received the vaccine was already very sore. I laid in bed and fell asleep and continued sleeping off and on for the rest of the day and night. My shoulder was still sore the following morning when I woke up. As the day progressed my fatigue increased (Sunday was not too bad.) Monday (3.22.21) I felt terrible, (headache, brain-fog, bad back pain, bad knee pain, bad hip pain.) My symptoms have persisted all week. I am unsure as to what to do. I do not have a doctor that I regular see. I am afraid to receive another dose and have even worse reactions/side-effects

A 34-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 vaccine, Solution for injection, Lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 12Feb2021 at 09:00 AM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included 1 kidney stone. The patient had allergies of whey (milk and cheese). Patient had no vaccination prior to COVID. Concomitant medication included Calcium supplement gummies (from two weeks). Patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (COVID 19 vaccine, Solution for injection, Lot number: EC9261 or EL9261) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22Jan2021 at 02:45 PM. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 12 Feb2021, the patient had no side effects for almost 12 hours (Fri 9am-9pm).

The Patient was unable to sleep friday night due to the pain and on saturday had difficulty getting comfortable. By sunday the back pain subsided but the neck pain and stiff neck remained, patient had difficulty turning the head. The patient continued to have chills and fever. Ibuprofen helped some with the symptoms. By sunday night patient had no major symptoms but had blood in stool on Sunday and Monday. Event blood in my stool was considered as medically significant. Patient had fully recovered in 2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering a plausible temporal association between the event &#39;Hematochezia&#39; and the suspect drug BNT162B2, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Sore left arm, muscle soreness, fatigue waking up the next day. Around 24 hrs after vaccination, headache started, and lasted for ~8 hours. I took some advil around an hour before the headache stopped (really wish I&#39;d taken it when I first felt the headache). I could feel the muscle soreness go away before the headache did. The headache felt like it moved from behind my eyes to the back of my head. I decided to only eat bits and pieces of stuff when I was feeling my worst because I was concerned that would make me feel nauseated (never did feel that way, so no idea if that made a difference). I drank probably 200oz of liquid throughout the day, but still felt dehydrated, even though I wasn&#39;t sweating. Did pee a lot though. Generally it was what I expected, but a friend who works at a hospital said I should report the info.

                                                When I got the shot I felt okay for the rest of the day, but the injection site on my right arm hurt a bit for the rest of the day. The next morning my right arm still hurt, but it was not worst. However my left hand and left elbow felt very stiff. When I tried to bend my left elbow it hurt a bit. When I tried to bend my fingers on my left hand it hurt very much. I couldn&#39;t even make a fist it hurt so much. I kept slowly bending my elbow and bending my fingers until the pain and stiffness would go away. Most of the pain and stiffness went away, but a little still remained. It feels like I have some kind of Arthritis in my left hand and left elbow, but I have never had it before. Since I got the COVID-19 vaccine, every time I wake up I have been experience the same thing.

                                                Vaccine was received  Friday around noon. Friday night i had a headache. By Saturday morning I had muscle aches, chills, and terrible headache. Muscle aches, chills and headache resolved by early Sunday morning. Sunday morning around 9am an itchy rash started on the abdomen. Over the course of 30 minutes it moved from the stomach area to other parts of the body (shoulders, back, head, feed, hands, etc, only the face and neck have avoided seeing rash). It pops up and then dissipates and then moves to another area over the course of 30 minutes to an hour. It has been two weeks since the shot and the rash is still present, coming and going, moving around the body. Allergy medication controls the rash, but when the medication wears off the rash returns.

                                                I had a nasty zit on the back of my neck, popped it, and my immune response was extreme. Initial: Itching and burning through my neck and shoulders, and swollen lymph nodes in neck and collarbone. I began sweating at night profusely and losing weight. I have had a lot of trouble sleeping. These symptoms continued in 24-48 hour cycles of flare ups until 04/19/2021 but finally seem to be abating. Progression: secondary symptoms appeared over the course of the month such as full body joint soreness, weakness, stiffness, stabbing pains (in the neck, arms, chest, and abdomen), blood pressure spikes, dry/sore throat, dry eyes, difficulty swallowing. Symptoms are similar to arthritis or other autoimmune diseases. Night sweats continue but are lighter. Weight loss continues but slower. Sleeping remains irregular.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I experienced soreness in the left side of my neck within a few minutes of getting the vaccine shot in my left arm. Approximately 5 minutes after the shot I experienced swelling in my throat. The swelling did not restrict my breathing but it was uncomfortable and unlike anything I have experience before. I have never had a previous allergic reaction to any shot, medication, or food in my medical history. Approximately 10 minutes after the symptoms began, the swelling of my throat went away.

                                                3 days after I got the 1st dose I started to muscle tightness in both of my upper legs, and buttox. I took a muscle relaxer 10 mg cyclobenzaprine once a day to try and relieve the tightness and pain but did not seem to make any difference. I drive a work truck for a living and I could not even bare to sit down anymore. The pain in my legs got to be so bad that I could not work anymore. On 5-1-2021 both of my upper legs, hips and low back where all &#34;on fire&#34;, extremely painful to walk, could not sit down at all. Both buttox muscles hurt extremely bad when I sat down. Everything was hot to the touch and just had pulsating pain. 10 days after icing and taking ibprohen,  the pulsating pain finally stopped in everything except for my left hip and low back. (But I have had chronic left hip pain and low back pain for awhile bow so that&#39;s just &#34;normal&#34; for me). Another symptom that has started is upper right abdominal cramping and feeling nauseous. Especially when getting up to quickly. I am very nervous about getting my 2nd dose of the Pfizer shot. Which is scheduled for tomorrow in fact.

                                                16 hours after my second shot, I woke up with some nausea.  I went to the bathroom, did not vomit, however in the middle of urinating I collapsed on the floor, couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t form full sentences, started sweating profusely, had to crawl back to my bed, and my pulse was through the roof.  I almost went to the ER, but the episode subsided within 15 minutes.   When I tried to fall back asleep, it felt like I was blacking out and not drifting asleep.  The next day, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms.  Followed by 4 days of normalcy.  On the 4th day, while working, I experienced a sharp 3 second &#34;electric shock&#34; feeling in my left side of my chest.   On the 5th day, I already had previously scheduled an appointment with my primary for a physical.  I told her about my episode; she took an EKG which yielded normal results.  Lab work also looked ok.  On the 6th day, I started feeling some more nausea and fatigue.  On the 7th day, the vertigo intensified tenfold, and the room was spinning.  That&#39;s when I started experiencing the following symptoms:  ? More nausea. ? Dizzy spells that come and go, especially after eating. ? Persistent periodic electric shock feeling in my left chest.  It?s dull but annoying.  And just when I think it?s gone for good, another 1 second shock happens. ? Left arm is  weak - the entire arm. ? When I try to sleep, the left side of my head feels as though I?m blacking out when I start drifting.  It almost feels like I?m getting anesthesia or something like that.  But just the left side. ? Basically the left side of my body (I got the jab in my left arm) from the waist up just feels off. ? One of my arms is numb when I wake up until I shake it out.  It?s not one particular arm. ? Energy levels are low.  Especially when I wake up and start moving around.  On the 8th day, I went to the ER thinking  perhaps it was a heart attack.  Nothing - EKG was again normal and lab work was normal.  The doctor told me it&#39;s all in my head - anxiety.  However, I&#39;m not anxious and I&#39;m a very level headed individual.    It&#39;s now day 12 and I feel overall awful.  I can&#39;t concentrate on anything.  I&#39;m not thinking clearly and forgetting simple things.  The dull feeling and electric shocks on my left side continue.  I&#39;ve never felt this bad before.  I&#39;m a healthy 34 year old that exercises regularly, has never smoked or done drugs, rarely drinks alcohol, and eats generally very healthy.  If given a second chance I would not take the covid shot.  I am praying this goes away.

                                                After receiving my second COVID-19 vaccine, I began feeling feverish and achy about 20 hours after the shot. I left work early to come home and rest. About 34 hours after the shot, I woke up around 2:00 am with intense abdominal and back pain, a fever, and vomiting. I took Tylenol and tried to rest, but my discomfort continued throughout the day. By the afternoon of March 30, I began to worry that I was having more than a typical vaccine reaction. The PA who saw me assessed my symptoms, performed an abdominal exam, and then dismissed my issues as a bad vaccine reaction. He gave me an injection of toradol and sent me home. My symptoms subsided after the toradol injection, but I still felt unwell.   On March 31, I had a previously scheduled visit with my primary care doctor. During the visit, I described my symptoms after receiving the vaccine, but I was told again that I was just having a really bad reaction to the vaccine. Throughout that day, my condition continued to worsen, and by the evening of the 31st I developed a fever and my abdominal pain returned. I scheduled an emergency telemedicine visit. I described my symptoms and described the pain I was feeling, but again, I was told I was having a bad vaccine reaction.   On the morning of April 1, I woke up with a fever and debilitating abdominal pain. I drove myself to the ER where I was diagnosed appendicitis. My appendix was about to rupture, so I was rushed into surgery. I was released after several days but had to return.

He reported having lunch with his friends but could not stand and needed help walking to his car, could not walk on his own. I asked if he has any history of back pain or a similar situation and he denied any previous experience similar to this. I advised patient to contact his doctor as soon as possible for observation.

After that, had tingling sensation in both arms and tongue for 10 - 15 minutes. Since the initial event, I have had a tingling/numbness sensation below my knee on my right leg, on the outside of my leg extending down to my toes and on the top of my foot. The inside of my leg feels fine so does the bottom of my foot. I can move my foot from side to side and point my foot and toes down, but I have weakness and lack of mobility when pointing my foot and toes upwards. When trying to stand on toes my right foot buckles. Can&#39;t walk on my right heel.

I felt some soreness in my neck Friday the 25th but didnt think much of it. The next day, Saturday 26th, my neck was completely tense with horrible pain when trying to turn my neck, especially to the right.   My wife received the vaccine at the same time I did and she is also experiencing the same neck issue as me, we found it strange that both of use are having the same pain after receiving the vaccine and decided to report this issue.  It is now 4 days later and the pain is still present along with limited range of motion.

Approximately three weeks (06/20/2021) after he received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine he started having complications walking. From June 20 through June 23rd he used a cane to get around to help him but was still struggling to walk. After those three days and it getting worse he went in to an urgent care where his Primary works at. They referred him to the Emergency room . He went to the emergency room on June 23rd where he was receiving treatment and was moved to inpatient on the morning of June 24th. The Hospital has run multiple tests including three MRIs, provided physical therapy, and none of the tests they have performed have all come back normal. This is not normal for the Pt not to be able to walk, he has always been very self sufficient even with having a hurt back.

From the symptoms the doctor said it was a tonic-clonic seizure, and that it was a side effect of the vaccine. They told me I turned purple, stopped breathing, and exhaled the remaining air until I stopped breathing for about 30 seconds until then I came back to my senses. The firefighters examined me and all my vital signs were fine so they recommended that I go home and rest.

                                                5 mins after receiving vaccine I felt a strong sense of heat within the muscles in my back. Soon after felt anxiety and scared so I ran to the front of pharmacy to get the pharmacist?s attention for them to call 911. I began feeling weak and started hyperventilating, feeling like I was going to die. Almost felt difficult to gasp for a full breath of air. As I got on the floor due to feeling weak, I began sweating profusely in my face, while at the same time, seeing my sweat drip on the ground like I just ran a full sprint mile. I was begging the pharmacist for some water but she refused to give me water because she thought I would choke. I was able to breathe but hyperventilating made it difficult. A couple mins passed, and I began to try my best to control my breathing by taking deeper breaths. I say about 5 mins, the paramedics arrived, but by then, all the side effects went away. Lastly, I felt the chills and very cold by the time the medics came. I got up on my own accord, went outside in the sun and felt normal again.

Patient swore this was related to the vaccine. This patient tested positive for COVID. He had a CT (computerised tomogram) scan which showed extensive infiltration in the lungs in Dec2020. Patient was admitted to the hospital on 24Dec2020 and then was moved to the ICU 2 days later, on 26Dec2020. Caller thought patient had a positive COVID test at another hospital. Caller did know that tested positive at the current hospital on 26Dec2020 which was done to confirm the previous positive test. Caller thought patient had his first positive COVID test either the same day or the next day after receiving the vaccine. Event of O2 Saturation of 80% / hypoxia was reported as hospitalization from 24Dec2020 and life threatening; infiltration in the lungs and shortness of breath caused hospitalization from 24Dec2020, muscle pain, chills and positive COVID test was reported as medically significant; and other events were reported as non-serious.  Outcome of O2 saturation of 80% / hypoxia and shortness of breath was not recovered, outcome of cough was recovering; and outcome of other events were unknown.

Second shot same as above but starting 24 hours after vaccine I developed left axillary pain. Able to palpate a lymph node ~1cm. Very painful on palpation. Has not limited activity but still painful. Was difficult to fall asleep  2 nights after vaccine. Now day 2 after vaccine still hurts, maybe incrementally better but taking ibuprofen. Cannot palpate significant lymphadenopathy otherwise.  No fever. I am a physician.

Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

Took OTC acetaminophen and NDAIDs. Visited employees health who sent me to urgent care for neurological exam. Urgent care physician noted right arm weaker than left and recorded report of bilateral upper extremity paresthesia. Recommended follow up exam and cervical MRI if symptoms worsen or do not resolve within 7 days. Neck pain has improved but still present. Paresthesias still present. Right arm (dominant arm) still weaker than left. Will follow up with primary care physician this week if symptoms continue.  Additional side effects: headache, dizziness, nausea, shivers, fatigue, joint pain (all resolved within 72 hours).

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

Those stopped by the second day morning (day after vaccine). However, in the second morning ( day after vaccine) I started having pain on left side of neck and on Trapezius muscle on left shoulder blade - and had that pain for three more days. Range of motion for neck restricted for three days. All symptoms improved after four days. I took Lidocaine patch and Tylenol for neck and shoulder blade pain.

The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

Slight to noticable light headed or slight dizziness regardless of physical position. Drinking plenty of water, adding in Gatorade for electrolytes. Was wondering if any OTC (advil,tylenol,etc) was recommended for the light head. If not I&#39;ll probably be fine in a day, just reporting in and hoping to speed this along. I&#39;ll probably just go to sleep for the day and if anything gets worse I&#39;ll submit another report. The time is 2:50 pm. Thanks for the hard work everybody. Have a nice day.

The next day was even more of the same if not worse. Stayed in bed and even with multiple blankets was still shivering, but sweating like crazy. Towards the evening there was a slight break in the cold and aching. Woke up and there were still aches and cold chills, but way less painful. Third day was just  dull aches that went away in the evening. No more noticeable effects since then.

Second vaccine (04/29/2021), slight headache after about 6 hours?woke up at 2:30am (11 hours after second vaccine) with flush feeling/light sweating but no fever. Triggered my vasovagal syncope (had this happen with other vaccines before so no big deal) to have a heavier heartbeat (about 10-20bpm higher than normal) for about 2 hours. Insomnia until about 6am. Next day 4/30 minor soreness, fatigue, soreness at injection site and ?blah? feeling with headache.  5/1/2021: woke up feeling great, other than soreness in my left arm and armpit area. By noon 5/1 most soreness gone with little to no other symptoms?

                                                After 2nd dose of COVID19 vaccine (taken 3 weeks after first dose) I had a feeling of a mild fever/chills and low energy and body aches about 12 hours after the injection. However I also begin getting a lot of pain and tightness around my right rib cage intercostal muscle area and lower back (QL area to Lats). This made it harder to breath and hurt while I laid down to sleep. It also hurt to take a deep breath/cough/laugh etc. This lasted until Thursday night (4/29/21) when the same kind of pain moved over to my left side. The past 2 days it has become quite intense though making it impossible to sleep on my back last night (I had to sit upright to avoid intense pain) and painful to even walk. It still hurts in my left rib cage at rest (feels more like a dull ache and stiff), but intensifies if I try to expand my lungs with breathing or lie down or move in any way. Mainly intercostal area around the rib cage and the back around my lung. Thought I might have to go to the emergency room last night it was so bad.

                                                Symptoms started approximately 14 hours post-vaccination.  Day 1 symptoms:   - Fever (&lt;= 101.0 degrees F)   - Chills   - Headache   - Fatigue/tiredness   - Vomiting (one time exactly 24 hours post onset of symptoms)  Days 2 - 5 symptoms:   - Severe pain/tightness and fatigue feeling in both arms, shoulder blades, and chest.  This has slowly improved over days 2 through 5.   - Nausea associated with the pain/tightness noted above   - Coughing (no phlegm)   - Vomiting (one more time on day 2 exactly 24 hours after the first vomiting episode)   - Fever and chills (both resolved by days 2-3)  Treatments:   - 500 mg Tylenol was used to treat fever and pain during the first several days.  Fever was well controlled, but pain was only partially controlled   - On days 3&#43; Advil was used for pain relief and it was effective   - Alka Seltzer Gold was used to treat nausea as necessary.  It was not particularly effective as the nausea seemed linked to the severity of the pain.  When the pain eased, the nausea did as well.   Outcomes:   - Symptoms have slowly improved over the 5 days post 2nd dose vaccination.  Advil has been discontinued since the afternoon of day 4.  No fever is present and the pain is now only mild.

This 35-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 28Jan2021 (at 35-years of age) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included testosterone cipionate, vortioxetine hydrobromide (TRINTELLIX) and propranolol, all from unknown dates for unknown indications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number EK9231) on 06Jan2021 at 16:00 (at 35-years of age) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported experiencing rapid onset of back pain that shifted positions and was then in the left neck, shoulder and arm regions on 04Feb2021 at 07:00, 7 days following the second shot. He reported he was referred by his primary care physician and physical therapist to a physiatrist specializing in spine/neck issues. It was unknown if treatment was received for the events. The clinical outcomes of back pain that shifted positions and was then in the left neck, shoulder and arm regions were not recovered. It was also reported that since vaccination, the patient had tested negative for COVID-19 via blood test on 15Feb2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot number cannot be obtained.

                                                First dose: Pain around injection site spread to shoulder. Started within one minute. Kept me awake the first night and lasted 3-4 days on and off. Very intense headache for the first few days. Ears felt funny. Hard to think. Felt like my brain was swollen. It was most intense after the first shot but hasn&#39;t gone away. Head/neck ache; muscle aches; back pain; stomach pain lasted about a week. Wheezing cough has come and gone since the first dose. Brain fog; lightheadedness; dizziness; irritability has not gone away five weeks later. Phantosmia: persistent and distracting olfactory hallucinations. Worst between the first and second doses but hasn&#39;t gone away completely. General inflammation: old injuries hurting, swelling and swollen lymph nodes around my body.  Second dose: Pain in injection arm, lasted only about two days. Flu-like symptoms for the first week. Fatigue; headache; cough; muscle aches; fever; intense nausea. Starting about three days after the second dose, I could barely eat for three or four days. This was similar to when I was on chemotherapy. Fatigue (any physical activity is tiring). Difficult to go to work. If I do, then I have to lie down the entire next day. Any exertion makes all other side effects worse.

                                                Received his second Pfizer COVID vaccine Tuesday 5/18/2021.  On Wednesday started developing systemic symptoms such as chills, headache, myalgia.  Also developed constant sub-sternal chest pain.  Worse with movement or deep inspiration.  No clear positional component.   CP persisted until he came to the ED today.  Initial ECG showed concave ST elevations lateral leads.  Given his history this was felt to be most consistent with pericarditis.  He received toradol, morphine and SL NTG with near complete relief of the pain.  Repeat ECG showed resolution ST elevations.  Troponin was elevated, peak 9.08 ng/ml.

A 35-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 21Jan2021 12:00 (at 35 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL9263) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing food allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  After receiving the Covid Vaccine on 21Jan2021, the caller has experienced a lot of adverse side effects that he&#39;s dealing with now almost 3 and a half months later. He has seen numerous doctors as well as specialists. He has a long list of symptoms that occurred at onset. What he is dealing with now is a swollen neck (onset date 21Jan2021), a sore throat (onset date 21Jan2021), tongue discoloration, and just general fatigue (onset date 21Jan2021) and malaise (onset date 21Jan2021). Prior to the shot he was physically healthy. He was running about 20 miles a week. Then he got the shot and his health declined significantly and he is still recovering. When this occurred, caller weighed 165 pounds, and now he weighs 145 pounds. He lost 20 pounds. These events happened after the first dose of the vaccine. He got his vaccine at around noon on 21Jan2021, and by that evening at around 2000 he had a tightness in his throat, felt like his right ear was plugged up, then had pain on the right side of his neck. It all coincided with the same side as the vaccine, which he had in his right arm. He also experienced some pretty severe chills. His throat still feels swollen, probably because of his swollen lymph nodes. Some days it is better and some days it is worse. It is causing constant pressure on his neck. He is not sure if he noticed the swollen lymph nodes the same day as the shot or shortly after.Patient does not currently have neck pain. He should probably mention it started probably a few weeks after the onset of his symptoms. He does not know when it went away. He was getting swollen lymph nodes on his left side as well, and his throat became sore on the left side as well. It went away maybe a few weeks ago. He is not sure when the swollen lymph nodes or the sore throat started. His right ear was plugged and then it affected his left ear and it got plugged up as well. It was to the point where he could barely hear. It was almost like an ear infection when it is completely plugged and there is pressure behind the ear drum. 2 weeks after his right side it started on the left side. It has subsided by this time, but it has not completely gone away, but it is not as bad. Patietnt had the chills for 3 weeks, but they weren&#39;t as severe as the first night. He was just freezing cold and could not get warm. After that night he was still having issues feeling warm and had to keep his bedroom at like 80 degrees constantly. It probably continued for about a month. He doesn&#39;t have chills now, however it evolved into more of a heat intolerance. Whenever he feels to warm he feels more tired and not well overall. It is really odd. It is more heat intolerance he feels is going on. After the first few months it started then he had the opposite. He had a problem getting warm, then after the first month he didn&#39;t tolerate heat too well. He is not sure when the tongue discoloration first started, but he noticed it about a month and a half ago. The general fatigue and malaise started at the beginning with everything else. He did not have the second dose of the vaccine. Caller believes the doctors ran a CBC. He had a complete panel done a few times and nothing concerning presented or stood out to the doctors. They did an ultrasound on the left side of his abdomen to make sure he had no spleen enlargement, and that came back normal. They ran thyroid panels and those came back normal. One thing that came back abnormal that explains more of this but the timing is odd with the vaccine is he came back positive for Mono. He started seeing an ENT specialist, and he believes that getting the vaccine could have caused his immune system to freak out considering his history with allergies. It could have caused the Epstein Mono virus already present to become reactivated. That was kind of his theory on why this could have occurred. All the events caused a visit to Emergency Room. He went to the ER about a week, exactly a week after he had the vaccine that day. He was having trouble swallowing (onset date 28Jan2021) as well as his breathing was becoming a concern (onset date 28Jan2021) for him. He also was just having what felt like anxiety-like symptoms (onset date 28Jan2021), and he has no history of anxiety. If he got the vaccine on 21Jan2021 then this happened around 28Jan2021. He did have another ER visit about a week after that one as well. He started to have severe symptoms similar to the first time he went. He is still having a little bit of an issue swallowing. He attributes that to the swelling in his lymph nodes and neck possibly affecting that. His breathing he does not have problems with so much now. He has more of a constant discomfort in his neck, though it is not affecting his breathing at this point. As far as general anxiety he still has that and it does cause issues. It is causing him to not sleep as a result. His swallowing is better. His breathing was the most severe of the symptoms. Maybe after the first month it began to become less of an issue. He couldn&#39;t say exactly when it went away. It probably went away as a result of the swelling subsiding. To be honest he is not sure. Doctors put the caller on numerous medications as well as a medicine that he continued with. He doesn&#39;t know if his anxiety is better as a result of the medicine helping or if it would be the same if he went off of it. He is not sure. He has had trouble sleeping since this all began. It has been a little better. It could be a result of the medicine that helped. He is really unsure if he was not on the medicine how it would be. Patient visited a Physician Office for all events.No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the events Throat tightness,Sensation of block in ear,Swallowing difficult,Anxiety, Sleep difficult,Hearing reduced was recovering; chills,Swollen lymph nodes,Neck pain,Sore throat was recovered; Tongue discoloration, heat intolerance,Fatigue,Malaise was not recovered; other events was unknown.

He sat down for bit and symptoms persisted.  He vomited x1 and went home, assuming he had developed the same &#34;24 GI bug&#34; his daughter had over the weekend. Once home he continued to feel unwell.  He called his mother who proceeded to call EMS.  EKG revealed anterior and inferior STE and he was taken directly to cardio lab for emergent coronary angiography, where he was found to have total thrombotic occlusion of midLAD, treated with drug-eluting stents.

I was working and thought I was going to pass out so I went home, and I tried calling the hospital, but they said they couldn&#39;t recommend if I should go in or not. A week after that every joint in my body was killing me. I had a little bit of breathing issues probably about a week after. Chest tightness, not being able to get a full breath. 48-72 hours after that my knuckles and joints were hurting. 48 hours after that the tightness in chest started and the trouble breathing. I did not go to an urgent care. My brain just feels like it shut off a little bit and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just something in my head or not.

                                                The first reaction I had on 05/19/2021 was body pain from my back to all over my front side which feels like I&#39;m having a heart attack without the shortness of breathe. Whenever I moved my head forward, I experienced a cramping pain and it was the first time for me. I alerted my wife that my back was really hurting and the next day when I woke up, I felt sick with eye pain even though I wear glasses (have never happened to me before). The pain became worst as the day progressed (a pulsating pain at the back of my eyes and whenever I moved, I felt like I was going to faint. I stayed in bed because I could not move (includes light sensitivity...room has to be dim all the time and on May 27, I lost partial hearing in the left ear along with ringing in my ear). I was not sick and wanted to know what was going on (went to the ENT). The lost happened for 4 days and then it moved to the right ear on May 29 and I lost my hearing and it made me afraid that I would lose my hearing (went on and off for several weeks with both ears). I&#39;m a Nurse and I told my wife that it may be an autoimmune reaction but I have never had any illness; therefore, I took  Loratadine. My PCP prescribed me Advil and Tylenol but the pain did not go away in my ears and it didn&#39;t work. I also still have eye pain and can drive because now (having been taking Vitamins B-12 and B-6 to help me recover). I also have a change in my taste buds. The ringing in my ears and the hearing lost scared me the most. The headaches will probably be with me a while since the progress is so slow. I also still have pain at the back of my eyes. I also had one episode of vertigo and also a time when I felt that my legs had weakness in them.

I started having panic attacks and shakiness in my arms along with lose of weight (no appetite whatsoever). It has been like that every since and then the insomnia following the 2nd dosage and I had a feeling of bloating after I ate anything, became restless, sweating a lot, vision was blurry, and noticeable changes in my stool (became yellowish). I been gasping for air after any physical activity or eating. I also noticed that the mucus is yellowish in my throat and tongue. I also experience muscle cramps when attempting to fall asleep which causes me to wake up instantly (also happens when I eat...legs and arms start twitching). If I try to swallow, the yellowish mucus wakes me up while I am trying to sleep. The symptoms started gradually and I didn&#39;t have anything of them prior to taking either dosage of the vaccine. The emergency medical team did some tests upon arriving at my home to see if I needed to be transported to the hospital (was not necessary since my heart was working fine).

Approximately 10 hours after vaccination i felt very fatigued and tired and went to bed early. Approximately 12 hours after vaccination I woke from sleep with fevers (101.8), chills, and headache. I took tylenol, fever subsided,  and was able to return to sleep at approximately  4:00AM. I woke at 6:30AM with headache, dizziness, and fever (99-100).  I took more tylenol and fever and headache subsided. For remainder of day temperature would start in increase, but stayed below 99, and headache would return between doses of tylenol. I slept through the night of 1/9/2021 and woke 1/10/2021 without fever or headache, although I would experience dizziness with exertion above level of walking.  Today, 1/11/2021, I am not experiencing any symptoms.

Couldn&#39;t abduct arm for about 24 hours due to pain.  Very faint red rash a few inches below injection site that goes across arm.  Arm is moderately itchy and has been since Monday 1/18/21.  Arm feels tight and is still pretty sore when reaching out and stretching it above my head.   No redness, itchiness, or discomfort around injection site.  Everything is in the middle of the upper arm.  The itchiness and prolonged soreness are my concerns, considering I still need a 2nd dose.

                                                Stronger pain in area of shot (compared to first dose) Soreness About 14-15 hours after the 2nd dose, I began feeling extremely fatigue. Also developed a slight chills feeling.  At the 21 hour mark, I was exhausted. Felt very weak and stared feeling a little warm. Around hour 22/23, body/bone aches developed.  By 24hrs after the 2nd vaccine, I took 800mg of ibuprofen (to help with the body aches and slight fever) and a Zyrtec for my allergies.  I&#39;m awake and getting ready for work again (I worked through the symptoms yesterday, somehow) approx 34hrs after the 2nd dose. I feel &#34;normal&#34; considering my arm is still sore from the shot. But all other symptoms appear to have subsided; my only tiredness is from waking up early for work.

                                                Mild headache approx 4 hours after injection.  When waking to alarm at 0600 on 25Mar21, noticed that bed was wet from sweating.  Foread was hot to the touch, ague, severe headache, light and noise sensitivity.  The room was cold, I turned up the heat in the house and put on sweatpants, socks, thermal shirt, hoodie, and beanie and could not get warm.  Began drinking water (1.5 gal by end of day at 2300).   No appetite for the entire day, nausea set on after eating a bowl of oatmeal around 1030.  Had several episodes of dry heaving, but no vomiting after eating.  Ate again at around 1900 - chicken broth and a peanut butter sandwich, nausea set on at around 1945, dry heaving, but no vomiting.  Spoke with PCM on symptoms and continued to monitor.  On 26 Mar21, cold sensation had abated, continued drinking water.  Headache, light sensitivity, nausea, and body aches for the entire day, headache has remaind constant - 6 out of 10.  Nausea at a 4.  Body Aches varied between 4-7.  Around 1100, I noticed that my neck had stiffened and it felt as if I had a tension headache.  I used a theracane, heat, and an ice pack to try and relieve the tension with no success.  I have tried relaxation techniques learned from VA to manage pain with no success.  As of 2146, stiffness is around a 6, headache is a 7, body aches 3, nausea while sitting 1, while walking 4.

It feels like the beginning stages of a charlie horse about 25% of the time and I am getting 1 to 2 charlie horses each day.

                                                I was unable to sleep and began to feel significantly overheated by 10 or 11pm the night of my vaccination. To give a sense of the extent of the disturbance, I ended up standing outside for 10 minutes without shoes or socks in the cold night air (~45°F) to cool off, but remained shiftless the rest of the night and was unable to remain asleep for a full sleep cycle until early morning (4 or 5am). I did not take my temperature at any point but did not appear to have a significantly warm forehead. The next morning I woke up with a very sore left shoulder and arm (i.e. the site of my vaccination) and general muscular stiffness in my back. Raising my arm increases the soreness significantly. I have no concerns about my reactions, but they were significant for a first Pfizer COVID shot so I am reporting to provide information to VAERS.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Heavy sweating (sweating all over his body)&#34;, &#34;Head felt heavier; head was heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back&#34;, &#34;Throwing up; vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Nausea&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

Slept on the other side and went ok. Next night same pain around 5am, this time I couldn?t sleep after.  Then 3/4 days after the shot, pain in my groins and intestines. It feels really irritated and pain varies from 1 to 4.5 on a scale of 10 throughout the days. It?s been now 10 days since the shot and this pain is not getting away or improving. Sometimes I also experience pain in the left side of my  stomach as well but it?s much less frequent than groins and intestines.

I would go from normal temperature of around 98 to 101 or so and back within a matter of 20 minutes.  Additionally, random parts of my body would get very hot at times.  About 2 hours after the side effects started, I became nauseous and threw up.  I was unable to eat for nearly 24 hours.  It seems that the fever and most side effects subsided through the 2nd night after vaccination.

                                                4 days after the first shot I was feeling very very dizzy.   My ears felt full enough that I thought maybe they were just full of wax.  I bought an over the counter ear cleaning kit.  That didn&#39;t relieve any symptoms.  I never get headaches, but a couple days later the front top of my head was throbbing.  The area just above my forehead.  It was not sinus pressure, my face didn&#39;t feel any pressure or pain.  My throat also felt like I was being slightly choked.  Not my airway, but just my jugulars.  It began in the evenings.  It would feel like I had been hanging upside down for a while.  My head felt full of blood, like it was going to pop, like my eyes were bugging out.  By a week to 10 days later, my upper arms felt weak, my toes were tingling, and my heart would flutter for just a few seconds occasionally.  I was still dizzy, still felt like I was choking, except I was feeling this way all the time now.  The symptoms only seemed to be staying the same or getting worse.  I have NEVER gone to the doctor on my own in my life to get something checked, but this had me disconcerted enough to check in and see if I should get my second shot at all.  My appointment was to see my doctor was the morning of the same day I was scheduled to get my second Pfizer shot.  My doctor had not heard of these symptoms being associated with the Pfizer shot and chalked my symptoms up to stress.  I am not a stressful person and very much err on the side of &#34;waiting to see what happens&#34; if I feel sick.  I never feel sick.  But I accepted the explanation and took the second shot that day anyway.  It should be noted that the second shot made my left armpit swell up quite a bit.  I did feel dizzy again, but not nearly as much.  The other symptoms seemed to not be as bad either.

Patient reports dizzy spells over the past few days with shortness of breath and then last evening developed a diffuse rash over his chest and extremities associated with itching and burning sensation on 5/1 evening. He denies any nausea,vomiting,abdominal pain,diarrhea.No chest pain or cough.Denies headaches.Denies h/o of prior allergic reaction/concerns to the first dose of the vaccine or any other vaccine.Denies any new exposure other than as stated the 2nd dose of the covid vaccine. Treated with IV steroids, IV Pepcid, and IV Benadryl with improvement. Upon discharge, directed to continue Prednsione 40mg daily for three more days for a total of five days of steroids, and follow-up with PCP. SUBSEQUENTLY, returned to ER  acute onset of decreased visual acuity, diffuse arthralgias, joint pain, myalgias, lightheadedness, palpitations, vertigo, muscle spasms, and difficulty moving both upper extremities. This was accompanied by sharp, 10 out of 10, nonradiating, diffuse anterior chest pressure. Nothing made this better or worse. The patient was driving at that time, and was unable to control his arms, which resulted in his vehicle leaving the roadway.  He was able to bring the vehicle to a stop before crashing. Since then, his symptoms have gradually improved, although they have not completely resolved. The characteristics are identical to the events that led to his previous admission.

First night, it was very difficult to sleep - I did not get much. Dizziness was like being very drunk. Now every night laying down in bed looking up is dizzying, some nights worse than others but not as bad as first night of symptoms. This has been persistent for about a week. Some temporary dizziness when reorienting head quickly during the day, particularly looking up or down, but mainly worse at night in the dark, not debilitating. Sleeping with some low lights on helps reduce spinning feeling. Mild headache and tight neck/shoulders starting 9 days after injection but may be unrelated.

                                                I got my vaccine at 1:15pm and I had no symptoms for the first 9 hours and then I began experiencing a very extreme pulsing pain throughout my entire body. The pain felt very deep like it was at a skeletal level and lasted 24 hours. I took my first Advil at 2am, my second at 9am, and a Tylenol around 1pm and 4pm. My temperature at first dropped to 97 degrees but later rose as high as 100.84 degrees. I felt constant pulsing and painful chills that were overwhelming and the pain never let up at all for the first 16 hours and then began to subside slowly. I mostly laid in bed the entire day trying to sleep as it was impossible to sleep with the pain the first night. After waking up today 06/13/2021 my symptoms feel about 85% relieved with only mild chills and body aches remaining. I didn&#39;t feel a typical headache but I did feel periodic sharp pains in my head as well as my ears during the first 24 hours.

Caller stated that got a lot of the normal things, like his arm hurt, he had joint pain, his armpits hurt, he had muscle pain, and his bones hurt a little bit and reported that 5-6 hours after getting the vaccine he had ringing in his ears and that lasted a bit but then it went away, then the next day it came back, and not had the ringing since then. Stated that had slight pressure in his ears that is still there, but the ringing only happened the first two days. The pressure feels like an ear infection, no treatment for the ear ringing or pressure, but called his primary care provider and they told him to wait a bit and also said he could come in or he could try over the counter ear ringing medications, but they recommended calling to report it to Pfizer and get their opinion on it, she doesn&#39;t see any reason he could not get the second dose. Stated that his armpit hurting and things only lasted a couple hours, didn&#39;t take anything for the other pains either. Stated arm felt like an anvil for days, was super tired and fatigued. Still muscle and joint pain lasted a couple days after or lasted a day or two, main reason he called was because of the ear ringing and pressure. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                About 2 weeks after getting my first Pfizer shot, I woke up with burning left-sided substernal chest pain that persisted for hours.  When I went to get up to use the bathroom that night, I passed out.  For the next 1-2 months, I had exertional left-sided chest pain that then resolved spontaneously.  I&#39;m a 37-year-old male (was 36 at the time of symptoms), thin (BMI 23), exercise regularly, and take just one medication (the lowest dose of atorvastatin for mild dyslipidemia).  At the time I had these symptoms, the phenomenon of myocarditis after the Pfizer vaccine had not been widely reported, so it never occurred to me that my symptoms could have been due to this.  So I ended up receiving the second Pfizer vaccine about 3 weeks after the first dose.  My symptoms after the second dose were similar to others around me (24 hours of severe myalgias/chills/weakness followed by several days of not feeling like myself).   Now (6 months later), I feel essentially back to normal.

                                                After the first shot I had extreme soreness in my arm/shoulder. The pain began the 2nd day and was only sore at first, by the end of that day I could not lift my arm higher than my shoulder. This lasted another day and then by the 4th day after the shot I could move my arm normally but it was still sore until the 6th day after the shot.  After the second shot I began experiencing a lot of join pain in my hands and fingers and my feet and toes. The pain was mild, maybe a 4 out of 10 and lasted for about 3 days. Earlier this year I had similar issue&#39;s with joint pain that lasted a while but it had been gone for almost two months before returning immediately after the second shot.

First couple of days were fine, but starting  26-FEB-2021, I&#39;ve been exhibiting all of the following: Fever - Friday 98, Saturday (3 measures over 5 hours) 99.1, 99.3, 99.4, Sunday 98.5, Monday 99.4 (at night, work up in body aches), Tuesday(97.5), Wednesday 98.5 Chills - mild, 1-3 times. comes and goes through past week.  Occurs more at night.  Feeling cold - wearing sweat pants, two shirts, long sleeve shirt, sweater, during sleep.  Constantly add/remove clothes to regulate temperature. During day, have sweat pants &#43; sweater on 78&#43; degree weather. Muscle pain - in back, moving daily. First started in right chest and back right shoulder, has now disappeared.  Now in middle of back, around spin area, hard and uncomfortable to sleep, taking IB profin helps alleviate pain, 2 to 3 tables over counter.  pain in throat around vocal box, could be due to sneezing, slight soreness to touch/aches. Feeling unwell - comes and goes, day starts fine, then around noon/1pm i get super tired and sleep.  Sleeping schedule is generally 10PM to 6AM &#43; naps through day Lose stools - from 25-FEB to 27-FEB, cleared up on 29-FEB Coughing - started on 03-MAR-2021, slight about 1 to 3 times an hour. Headache - comes and goes, use IB profin only when trying to sleep, all other times i let it be.  Good news: No swelling at injection site No redness at injection site  No Swelling at injection site  Final notes: Just feeling up an down, not taking anything besides IB profin for pain management. I was going to work everyday pre-shot with out issue. Post-shot, not feeling well enough to report to work out of fear of spreading anything that i got. Weekend immune system. Slightly grumpy demeanure since sick and interrupted sleep patterns.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

I have never had an allergic reaction, so didn?t pay much attention to it. After returning home I became severely lightheaded and almost passed out. I immediately took a Benadryl and Motrin. Then my heart rate shot up to 160BPM according to my smart watch and maintained that for around 5 minutes. The home medicine helped it to subside, but the same feelings would return in moderate waves. By 2pm, I decided I should seek professional help and was taken to the ER by a family member. By this time I had moderate chest and jaw was very tight. At the ER I was monitored for 1 hour and then given an IV injection of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron(steroid). I immediately get relived and well. I was released from the ER around an hour later and sent home with a prescription of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone Oral Steroid. I have since had a few different side effects like chest pain, extremely flushed face, and low grade fevers. The medicine taken at home immediately stopped the face flushing.

                                                Only symptom experienced during first ~36 hours after receiving vaccine was soreness near injection area of left arm.   A couple hours after falling as sleep the second night after vaccination shot (Sunday night), I woke up very cold / severe shivering. After several hours I managed to fall asleep for approximately another 1-2 hours. The next day I experienced fever, shivers, general body weakness/fatigue, and muscle aches/discomfort especially in both legs. These symptoms lasted throughout the day.  That night (Monday night), when I got into bed, I was strongly shivering. I managed to fall asleep for 1-2 hours, but woke up uncomfortably warm. I was unable to fall back asleep until 4-5 hours later. I woke up 1-2 hours later, with most of my body dripping with sweat, and the sheets rather damp.  Tuesday and Wednesday: Symptoms came and went, mostly feelings of fever, chills, general fatigue, lost appetite, and mild light headedness. Sleeping remained difficult, able to stay asleep for &lt;4 hours each night.    As of today (Thursday), fever has subsided. Still generally feel fatigued, occasionally lightheaded.

Other symptoms include profusive sweating, joint pain, chills, fatigue, and tremors. Similar sensations as a fever. Increasing my body temperature via heaters, hot showers, and warm drinks temporarily alleviated these symptoms, but they returned with any moderate physical exertion. This lasted for 4 days.

                                                A few days after the shot, my lower back really started to hurt. So much, that I ended up in the ER thinking it could be kidney stones. ER staff were unable to determine the cause of the pain. Exactly one week after the shot (Tuesday), I start sweating profusely and nearly passing out at work. A day later (Wednesday), my heart rate went through the roof and I was dizzy, out of breath. By Friday night I was in an urgent care clinic with a resting heart rate of 145BPM. (My normal is in the 50s). I was diagnosed with Arterial Fibrillation. I have no history, or family history of heart issues. I run 3-5 days a week....3-10 miles at a time. In the military...very healthy.

                                                Worst sickness/flu like symptoms I have ever experienced. Bad dehydration, diarrhea, throwing up, fatigue, light headed, chills, fainting/passing out. Had to diarrhea over 30 times in one day, throw up several times. Went to emergency room for treatment. IV treatment plus anti naseau and anti cramping   Medication. Cramping was severe in upper intestine. Symptoms have decreased, but still linger after 2 weeks of 2nd shot.  Concern if side effects are permeant. I still very tired/fatigued,  have cramping, dirahaha, throwing up, aches muscles and joints- not feeling like myself and regret taking the vaccine if it results in lifelong side effects.

Comes and goes varying in intensity, usually a dull ache at the front of my forehead. Gets worse later in the day and into the evening. * Body aches--started in the shot arm, then moved to shoulders and neck and sometimes lower back. Comes and goes with varying intensity. Has persisted through day 9. Sometimes it feels like achey area is emitting heat. * Night sweats- started around day 3 * Congestion/sinus pressure--intense sinus pressure (not a runny nose or cough) starting day 4 persisting through day 9. C Currently taking a steady dose of tylenol and sudafed. Have been taking tylenol since the shot on 4/11. GP admits she has no idea if this is related to the vaccine or another virus. I would love to get some clarity.

Next day had a low grade fever all day and evening, extreme lethargy, and muscle aches all over my body, especially my back. That night, 2nd after shot, I had profuse sweating in bed while trying to sleep. Had to wake up several times to change clothes and bed sheets as they were soaked in sweat. Feeling better today, still a little lethargic but no fever or sweats. It?s been a rough couple days.

                                                Recipient had a prior history of the feeling of a lump in his throat, narrowing of his throat and dry throat with his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. This resolved with oral Benadryl at home.  Prior medical history included COVID disease in January, 2021. Due to his history, he was vaccinated next to our ambulance with physician and EMS team in attendance. Approximately 5 minutes after vaccination, recipient began complaining of dryness of the throat and feeling a lump in his throat without any compromise in breathing. Approximately 9 minutes post vaccination, he complained of a progression of his swallowing symptoms, swelling and pressure feeling (periorbital and in the malar area) of the face. He did not complain of dyspnea. Due to his symptoms, he was administered 0.3 mL of epinephrine IM at 10:39, followed by diphenhydramine 50 mg IM approximately 1-2 minutes later. Symptoms seemed to remain static, with treatment, with the exception of post-epinephrine shakiness and complaints of tingling of his feet. Initial vital signs were: Pulse 90, Respirations 20, BP 148/84 and SaO2 of 99. Vital signs and SaO2 remained stable.  A transport ambulance was notified and recipient was transferred to the care of EMS for further treatment and observation.

I get trouble breathing (like anxiety, but it&#39;s not). I feel my arm tingles like when you&#39;re on top of it and it&#39;s &#34;asleep&#34;.    I&#39;m super scared because these are &#34;known&#34; effects, but it&#39;s been 7 days now. Also, I&#39;m super scared because I&#39;ve heard second dose is when you actually feel sick... if this is the first one, will it get worse on the second one? is it recommended to get second one?

                                                Shortly after the shot which was painless to take, I felt soreness in my arm and stiffness in my neck and for about 1 min about 10 min after the shot my vision went slightly fuzzy and got slightly light headed but passed very quickly but I did feel flushed for about 30 min after. A few hours after though a fuzzy feeling over my head returned, my stomach was slightly nauseated, and had a slight fever.  This did not really go away before I went to bed for the night. My shot was about 1:15 PM EST this was noticed about 4-5 pm starting and lasting until bed. Around 4:00 Am I woke and my stomach was very nauseated to feeling like I would puke but I was able to go back to sleep. When I woke my left arm felt very sore, my stomach the rest of the day until sometime the next morning around 6 am was unsettled. No issues using the restroom. But the fuzzy headache had persisted but by the end of the night I had a very front sided top of the head headache that radiated to my neck off and on. Swallowing water hurt, lights were becoming slightly painful.  As well as my jaw ached a bit. I went to bed and throughout the night woke to a headache of the same nature but at time with a pulsing pain. Sometime around 6 am it did stop for the most part as well as my fever broke. When I got up for the morning and throughout the day now it being around 5:30 pm my stomach had stopped for the most part with the unsettled feeling, my headache for the most part disappeared but I still have this slight felling of something fuzzy laying on top of the front part of my brain.  It not a feeling of being on top of the head but actually a feeling on the brain.

Around 7 hours later and after a series of multiple tests I was told I have PE-blood clot in my lungs.   (3) Sun, May 16th - I was admitted in the hospital around 5:30am.

Weekend of 5/8 - vomiting, likely fever (felt like true vaccine side effects) - no vomiting/fever since  Since then, lots of tests/dr visits.  Current symptoms: tingliness/numbness - left leg - midshin to foot/toes. Left arm - elbow to hand/fingers. Face started to tingle ~2 weeks post vaccine - left side. Extremely fatigued. Some brain fog/forgetfullness. Lack of motivation. Irritability some days. Headaches - some days really bad, other days none. Chest pains come/go throughout day. Was getting winded walking up 3 stairs but that has been slightly better. Some days - extensive muscle pain. Especially in lower back &amp; left hip area. Some days - whole body aches. Chills - feels like body temp is off. Things come in waves - numbness/tingliness is pretty much all the time though. Also, insomnia. Did start to take 1.25mg of melatonin as needed but still very fatigued.  5/19 - Stared acupuncture (plan is 2x a week) Around 5/21 - developed rash. Face (R&amp;L side), neck/jaw area (L), inner thigh (L). Doesn&#39;t itch all the time but when it does, it really itches. Has continued 5/22 &amp; 5/23 - headaches worsened 5/22 &amp; 5/23 - developed diarrhea 5/23 - more tingliness developed midshin to right foot and more in right arm.  5/25 - joints began to hurt more - especially in elbow area  Lung dr. Rx&#39;ed albuterol (?) on Friday, 5/21 just in case something was going on in lungs. Has not helped.   The lung dr. noted weakness in right leg during physical exam.   Lung dr. and cardiologist discussed possibility of Guillain Barre Syndrome. Another blood test was ordered to check for some receptors. Awaiting results.  Neurologist appt scheduled for 5/ 28

                                                3 Days following my second shot, I felt a horrible shock/pain through my neck and jaw that made me crouch down in pain in the middle of a busy street. I went straight to an urgent care. The provider said it was a vaccine side effect and gave me steroids to take for four days. The next week, I went back because I began to feel a pulling sensation/pain develop on the side of my face. They referred me to an ENT. I went to the ENT.  He found a vocal chord nodule and ordered a CT scan.   Before I could make the CT scan appointment, I had an episode in the shower where I began to see flashing lights and my limbs became wobbly and weak. I was very dizzy and had to hug the shower wall for support. My wife took me to the emergency room where a multitude of tests were run including a CT scan. Nothing was remarkable, but the doctor was concerned about the neurological effects, and referred me to a neurologist.  I saw the neurologist the next day, and she diagnosed me with trigeminal neuralgia on top of ordering an MRI of my brain (normal). I am taking carbamazepine and baclofen as treatment for the condition. She said it can occur virally.

Naproxen helps but lymph nodes will swell if not taking it. I have had a cancer screening and that was clean. The doctor thinks the response to the vaccine may have caused this response. At this point my lymph nodes will swell and hurt and then go normal. This happens a few times a day.

When I came back around 4pm I was feeling okay, no sore on the injection site, unlike my regularly flu vaccines that I mostly feel sore at injection site which lasts about few hours immediately after the flu shot, so it was sort of surprising to see that but later that night, my body starts feeling weak, aches and a tangling on my feet, as the night progresses up to the early morning, I was unusually fatigued and lightheaded with the regression of the muscle aches and subsequently other symptoms started disappearing, notably, I started feeling soreness on the injection site, which lingered to the next day.

Details were as follows: the patient received the Covi-19 vaccine 30Dec2021. He had a reaction to the vaccine. 24 hours after getting the vaccine he had really bad chills, body aches, fever 100.4. He didn&#39;t take any medication for a bit. He then took acetaminophen (TYLENOL). He had a headache, he was unable to sleep. The acetaminophen worked and he went to bed. At 5:00 am he started having a bad headache and took Ibuprofen. He woke up to go to the bathroom. He passed out for 5-10 seconds in the bathroom. His head was leaning in the wall by the door. He was sweating and was stiff all over. He went to the Emergency Room on 01Jan2021. They did an X-ray and a CT scan. They gave him 100ml of saline and some pills. They also did some lab work. Everything was negative. They assumed his body couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. He was supposed to have received the second shot yesterday (20Jan2021).

Had first COVID-19 vaccination on 2/13.  Cannot exclude paraneoplastic syndrome; possible hilar mass noted on CXR will need further work-up to rule out sarcoid/malignancy. Concern for viral meningitis.  No known sick contacts. Another tonic-clonic seizure occurred around 08:00 on 2/24 AM with vomiting; no overt aspiration though certainly high risk given situation.&#34;

The primary reason i am reporting an adverse effect is that I am still experiencing mild soreness in the shoulder muscle into which the vaccine was injected.  Occasionally, this soreness seems to be present in the other muscles of my upper arm as well.  This mild soreness has persisted and been very consistent ever since the initial moderate soreness from the first injection subsided about 2 months ago.  I have not experienced this type of lingering soreness following any previous vaccination.

Later that night after going to bed he woke up w/ his muscles and nerves twitching and tingling.  He says you can sometimes see the muscles spasms and then other times he feels it tingling under the skin. Pt is still having these symptoms. He had a sore arm for about 48 hours. For about 3 to 4 days he had a faster heart rate and higher blood pressure than normal.   He developed a headache that lasted about 2 days.  Currently he is having some brain fog  and his shoulder and biceps still have a heavy feeling like they are detached from his body along with the muscle twitching and tingling.  He does not feel like these symptoms are improving and will see his PCP on 3/29/2021.

                                                At approximately 3:00 pm I was called to the observation area after reports from staff that a patient needed the epi pen due to a reaction from his injection. I proceeded to the area with an epi pen and requested for staff to activate EMS by calling 911. I discovered the patient laying on the ground in supine position, alert and oriented x3, multiple abrasions on forehead and knees. Assessed patient for SOB or any other symptoms to which he replied, ?I feel light headed and my knees hurt.? Measured vital signs ? Blood Pressure 108/47, O2SAT 97, Pulse 61. Per observation nurse, LVN, patient was sitting in an observation chair chatting with his girlfriend when he fell over face forward to the concrete ground. LVN then called for help and that is when I and vaccine nurse came to assist. Per Nurse , who administered the first dose of Pfizer to pt at 2:55 pm, he proceeded to the observation area a few minutes after his injection. Time of incident reported by  LVN was 3:00 pm. I continued to monitor the patient until EMS arrived. EMS transported patient to Hospital for further evaluation. - MB, RN

                                                After taking my 2nd Shot for Booster on the morning of Friday the 5th of 2021. I ate and hydrated for the day. At home I was resting when standing up I was overwhelmed with dizziness, nausea, sweats, and then the chills and heat hit. My inner core felt frozen. I couldn&#39;t move after standing up and the chills locked every bone in my body I couldn&#39;t breathe. Terrified doesn&#39;t cover how afraid I was at that moment. Teeth chattering, fingers rigid, and my back was solid. After moments in this state, I put on layers of sweaters to warm myself. The outside temperature was 65-70*C. So not that bad. I was in shock and not long after putting on my sweaters. My skin felt like it was sun burned and all the weight of the clothing was painful.  I could not lay down, or even roll on my side for rest. Even standing up made my spin hurt.  The muscles in my lower back seized up and the pain was right in the middle of my spin. (The ER Doctors checked and I do not have kidney stones.) I was fighting 99.3&#43; temp and rising. (This temp is accurate. I have phot evidence.)  There was no sleep that Friday night.  Saturday morning I called the first available chiropractor and went to that appointment at 2pm.  As a new client they don&#39;t want to go all out in the first session, but I was in pain with every breathe.  Hyperventilating and over breathing was causing issues with my head and stomach.  The session was amazing, electro therapy mixed with heavy cracks worked on by a professional did help, but only for a brief period of time. Walking away from the building I was still in more pain than ever.  My dad arrived to take me to the ER at roughly 6pm.   Doctors gave me fluid and anti inflammatory drip. Potassium and Tylenol.   It worked. The pain was unreal and I welcomed anything to end the suffering.

He also developed neuropathic pain. These symptoms began 2 days after vaccine administration. He was seen in the ED and admitted to the hospital on 3/29. He was diagnosed with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and started on PLEX and methylprednisolone. Patient continues to require inpatient hospitalization and significant assistance with his ADLs. He is also experiencing autonomic dysfunction with tachycardia, elevated BP, and diaphoresis.

                                                I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine last Thursday (4/8) at 9am. I did not have any immediate side effects -- just mild soreness at the injection site in my right arm approximately 8 hours later (I&#39;m left-handed), which subsided by the next morning. However, at approximately 3am on Friday (4/9), I woke up with a fair amount of discomfort in all of the fingers in my left (dominant) hand. It felt like what I would imagine someone suffering from arthritis might feel; I got up to take some ibuprofen and I had difficulty grasping the doorknob, for example. The pain mostly subsided by the time I woke back up, although there was some very minor continued stiffness in my left index finger, which also eventually seemed to go away after a few days.  Fast forward to this morning (4/13) and I woke up around 5am with renewed discomfort and stiffness in my left index finger, requiring ibuprofen. It is now ~3:45pm and the discomfort remains slightly, but has mostly subsided. I should add that I&#39;ve never experienced this before the vaccine, and I cannot think of anything I did differently in the last week other than receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  I reported this event today to my primary care physician, but have not sought additional treatment.

Sx included point tenderness just below left pectoral and difficulty breathing during inhalation due to pain as lungs expanded. Pt states pain felt like inflammation around upper lung or heart lining that was agitated with movement that lasted for 05 days and went away. 29MAR21 pt was treated at  Clinic at 0800 by Physician Assistant LT  to rule out cardiac related issues with an EKG that showed normal results. Prescribed Motrin 200mg and Famotidine 20mg that reduced discomfort. Pt was cleared to return to work with no current sx.

                                                On 3/27 I was diagnosed with gout following pain, redness, and swelling in my left foot. I also had pain in my shoulder. The next day I started developing a rash on the right side of my torso on my chest and back. In a follow up appointment with the doctor and a visit to the ER I was diagnosed shingles. I was prescribed acyclovir and indomethicin. The rash has mostly cleared, but pain in both my torso and foot still persists.

These symptoms worsened over the next eight hours, and a fever came on long with nausea/vomiting. Today is the day after my second injection and the symptoms are still present, except for the nausea/vomiting.

                                                I got gout in the big toe fingers in both my legs just 3 days following the 2nd vaccination shot, resulting in immense pain in my legs and making me completely unable to walk. I have been into an urgent care where they confirmed it is indeed gout and no swolenness due to fracture or infection.  I never had history or symptoms of gout or similar kind of illness ever earlier. I do exercise regularly, do not smoke or take alcohols, have properly maintained dietary habits and keep myself well hydrated. Given such lifestyle, the occurence of gout at an age of just 38 seems remote. So I have my doubts on the vaccine side effects. JUST A DISCLAIMER, I MAY BE WRONG.

                                                On day 2 or 3 of getting the shot, I started feeling a burning sensation in my chest and what felt like my heart. It was about 3 or 4 out of 10 on the pain scale. I also had intermittent tingling sensations, mostly on my cheek to the left of my nose, but also tingling in locations around my body which happened only a couple of times.  My heart beat rapidly. It was similar to the heart palpitations I get when I eat certain foods. It also felt as if my heart was constrained, as if its outer layers were less flexible than usual.  When the symptoms showed up I started following a fairly aggressive anti-inflammatory diet, mainly wheat/cereal and Advil. I spent most of the time  lying in bed facing up, in order to minimize strain on my heart. I had trouble laying on my side, since my chest/heart was sensitive to pressure. I also believe I was more acutely aware of the distribution of blood throughout my body, and laying on my side felt similar to being upside down in that blood was pooling heavily at the bottom, but I may be misremembering the sensation.  I don&#39;t know if I had shortness of breath, since I took care to avoid exertion. Since my heart was beating like crazy, exertion of any kind seemed like a really bad idea.  The symptoms did not change in severity for a couple days. On day 4 or 5 of getting the shot, I felt slightly feverish for about a 10 minute period. During this time, I noticed the burning sensation weakening slightly, and I began feeling a soreness on my chest near my left shoulder, which I believe is a lymph node area.  Each day after, the symptoms and my heart calmed down little by little.  ----  On day 9, I went to the emergency room since I still had heart palpitations and the burning sensation at about a 1/10 pain level. Just sitting upright caused my heart to go into overdrive. The hospital did not find anything out of the ordinary. I was given MAALOX, but the burning sensation was too faint to know if there was any improvement as a result.  Their best theory is that I had costochondritis.  ----  On day 11, after eating dinner I started getting &#34;chronic hiccups&#34;. These last anywhere from 10 minutes to a couple of hours without stopping. I am not sure whether food or drinks cause them. They are short/acute hiccups and happen at an interval of about 10-15 seconds. I have no history of such a thing.  ----  Today is day 12. The symptoms are noticeably better since I visited the hospital, but the burning sensation is still present around what feels like my heart and the hiccups aren&#39;t stopping.  My best theory is that I may have had an infection by the time I got the vaccine. Maybe I had an infection, not necessarily COVID but some related virus, that was kept in check below an immune response threshold until the vaccine came along and led to the immune system burning the whole infection down.

About a month in, pressure in nose, which goes through to tops of teeth came on.  Soon after, started feeling other neurological symptoms, including pain in hands, wrist, forearms and right foot.  Symptoms seem to come in waves.

Day 10, arm pain returns at the injection site. Day 20 arm pain has spread in size and pain, i cancel the second shot. elbow and wrist become inflamed, tight, pain restricted. become sick for 5 days, headaches exhausted.  prescribed 40mg prednisone for 5 days. first day it took the swelling down, then swelling came right back 2nd day. pinky and ring finder go numb, paresthesia/paresis. nerve pain in forearm to hand. ulnar nerve at first then all fingers. arm injection pain throbbing. rash shows up on stomach (now at 3.5 to 4 weeks since shot) cannot grasp a cup, weakness and numbness in hand. At this time its confined to the injection arm. Over the next week nerve pain and numbness spread to left side of face, both arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet, toes. physical therapist confirms elbow lymph node on injection arm swelling, hands turning red extreme pain and swelling, loss of feeling. nerve pain in the entire body, nerve and muscle spasms in all parts of body. Fingers and does burning at the tips feel like a string is cutting off circulation. Visibly red. Around the 4 week mark, fully unable to lift legs or arms, left half of face numb, zap/jots seizure like hitting my body. go to ER seemingly becoming paralyzed,  within hours strength of legs returns but with numb feet/toes. no diagnosis other than peripheral neuropathy. neck begins to swell, hurts to swallow, throat closing. trying to sleep, throat closed, wake up, completely unable to open throat cant breath. throat episodes lasted about 5 days and resolved. complete insomnia and 24/7tinitus. any attempt to sleep or become tired results in heavy body zaps like hooked to a tenz unit. can&#39;t use hands or type, arm to hand seized nerves, feel like shrunken or contracted nerves. PCP prescribes benzos to sleep. this allows some sleep with waking every hour. over the following weeks symptoms seem to improve slowly but still debilitating. today at week 8&#43; since one shot only, I am able to type again, but with nerve pain and numbness in all fingers. loud tinnitus, numbness in all limbs, episodes of extreme debilitating muscle fatigue come in waves, almost unable to stand agonizing muscle fatigue and nerve zapping. These full body muscle episodes only seem to come in waves of 24 hours, then seem to feel recovering, only to relapse again. injection site pain seems to have wrapped around to the bicep 24/7 pain. unsure if this is nerve or muscle. 3 ER visits, PCP visits, blood tests, no help. I cannot work, constant nerve firing muscle spasms and nerve pain and episodes of weakness so bad you cannot sit without agonizing pain. I am disabled from this and still searching for help

                                                Patient is a very pleasant 38-year-old male with no significant past medical history other than a BMI of 37 and a past history of COVID-19 infection in February 2021 which was asymptomatic with  no sequela after he was required to test after his wife tested positive .he is on no medications prior to arrival, he smokes an occasional cigar and drinks alcohol only occasionally who presented to the emergency room on 6/6/21 With a chief complaint of difficulty breathing,  fever, malaise and significant left-sided chest pain that have been ongoing since May 23 slowly worsening.  He denied any recent travel any recent illness any recent sick contacts.  He denied any illicit drug use over-the-counter supplement use .patient reported he received his first Pfizer Covid vaccine on 5/17/2021 and a few days after began to feel congestion with mild coughing which progressed.  He initially thought he may be having  allergies and took some Claritin without relief.  As the week went on he developed increasing shortness of breath and cough and also developed a fever.  He went to the well now urgent care on June 3 and was told he may have pulled a muscle and was sent home.  He returned back to our emergency room in the early morning of 6/4 complaining of again of left-sided chest pain radiating into his ribs with associated shortness of breath worse with inspiration associated with coughing but no hemoptysis.  At that time he had no complaints of fever or chills.  He works at a hardware store and thought perhaps he may have strained himself lifting heavy boxes of flooring.  During that ER visit he was hypotensive and tachycardic with respirations of 30.  CTA of the chest did not show any pulmonary emboli but showed inflammatory changes in the left side in the lingula consistent with possible acute community-acquired pneumonia.  He was given Toradol and morphine and was discharged home on oral antibiotics.  His EKG at that time showed sinus tachycardia the ST segments were normal.  He was afebrile.  He returned back to the emergency room the morning of 6/5 with complaints of worsening left-sided chest pain worsening shortness of breath and worsening fatigue.  He reported any movement he develops a cough and he cannot lie flat as he develops significant chest pain which is relieved with sitting up.  He had been taking some ibuprofen with minimal improvement.  He also reported some nausea and fatigue.  He had a fever at home of 102 °F just before coming to the hospital but arrived afebrile.  Patient admitted to having COVID-19 infection in February when his wife tested positive.  He was asymptomatic other than a headache for 1 day and recovered without any incident.  In the ER he was again tachycardic but was afebrile.  His blood pressure was 137/81 his O2 sat was 97% on room air.  He however was quite tachypneic with respirations of 35 at times at rest.  Lab work revealed a white blood cell count of 13.2 with significant elevations of his erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP at 75 and 20.8 respectively.  Covid testing was negative.  Repeat chest imaging reveals a large left pleural effusion and atelectasis with no pulmonary edema.  CT scan of the chest revealed no pulmonary emboli but now reveals right middle lobe and bibasilar infiltrates suspicious for an infectious or inflammatory process.    EKG revealed sinus tachycardia but no ST changes were apparent.  Was clinically dehydrated with an elevated specific gravity positive nitrites but 0-9 white blood cells on urinalysis.  Troponin at 0-hour was low -3 1 hour was -3 with no change in his delta.  BNP was normal at 14 lactic acid was normal at 1.1.  Procalcitonin was normal at 0.60 and lipase was normal at 21 with a normal CMP.  He was subsequently admitted to the hospitalist service.  In the emergency room he was given Rocephin and azithromycin. The following day his condition worsened with continued fever and increasing shortness of breath. . ESR was worsened from 75 to 82 and cardiac crp now &gt;200. A stat echo was ordered and his case was reviewed with the cardiologist. there was concern for possible myo/pericarditis so pt was started on colchicine and ibuprofen tid and the decision was made to transfer the patient to a larger tertiary care facility. stat echo showed normal ef and no sign pericardial effusion. He was transferred to another hospital where he was followed by cardiology and pulmonology. He ultimately underwent thorocentesis but the fluid reaccumulated so a chest tube/drain was placed. He was treated for a peripneumonic effusion. cultures and cytology were ultimately negative. acid fast bacilli was negative, blood cultures were negative. covid 19 pcr testing was negative x 2. He was discharged home on 6/11/2021 with instructions to continue augmentin bid for 4 more weeks with close follow up with pulmonary and repeat chest x ray in 1 month,

A 38-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech, formulation: solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0167), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 20May2021 11:30 (at the age of 38-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing SSRI discontinuation syndrome which would come back whenever he was sick and apparently also from the vaccine and ongoing electric brain zaps when he would get sick or have a temperature ever since he was a child and was taken off of paroxetine cold turkey which induced electric brain zaps and they went away at that time but continued having them lifelong whenever he would get sick, and also in response to this vaccine which felt like a jolt of electricity in the brain. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included lorazepam; diazepam; paroxetine and bisoprolol. The patient previously took paroxetine. On 21May2021 at 01:00, the patient experienced upper arm was extremely tender, painful and could not lift it above shoulder height due to pain. It was unknown if the patient received treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                1st covid shot: 10 minutes after I felt light headed and numbness\tingles throughout my entire body for up to a minute. (didn&#39;t eat prior) 2nd covid shot: felt similar symptoms but only lasted a few seconds. (ate that day) ------------------------------------------------  Issues\Symptoms Week 1  May 2-8 Right eye started slowly watering on Sunday and kept going for a week  Dizzy moment on a trip. Eye stopped watering mostly by Saturday -----------------------------------  Week 2  Dizzy moment again at a friend&#39;s  house(hadn&#39;t eaten that day).  Numbness through arms/weakness. May 10th: Panic attack. I was driving home and felt the numbness go through my arms so I pulled off and called friends to come and get me and take me home.  Ended up calling another firend who is a nurse and she had me squeeze someone&#39;s hand and check my face for sign of a stroke etc.  She thought I was having a panic attack and said to get some food, take some melatonin and try to calm down and goto sleep which I did.  May 11th: Saw General doc  who ordered blood work and heart monitor. No recommendations for immediate issue. EKG looked fine.  Through the week Numbness and tingles in arms and head Ringing in ears, lots of head/sinus pressure, unable to focus, brain fog. -----------------------------  Week 3 May 19th: Had blood drawn for testing: Night before getting heart monitor I couldn&#39;t sleep because it felt like not breathing fast enough made me light headed to the point I could pass out and was getting worried.  May 20th: Fitted with a heart monitor for 48 hours.  I was freaking out when we got to the hospital and almost went to the ER but we went to cardiology and saw the nurse who helped calm me down and did another EKG which looked good. Blood pressure was high that day possibly from the anxiety. Stayed at my dad&#39;s the next few days with the monitor, had tingles a couple times, some pressure, but slept well. ------------------------------  Week 4 May 24th: Followup with General doc said blood tests looked good, not diebetic, blood pressure fine, no signs of heart problems.  Gave me 6 days of prednisone and Nasonex for possible inflammation of Eustachian tube. (didn&#39;t feel like they helped any)  through the week: Felt okish for a day and a half, drove to work and then towards the end of the day started feeling off, right side feels like it&#39;s floating up and down, sensation down through leg which lasted about a week. Pushed in between nose and cheek on right side and felt numbness/pain shoot through my head on that side Periods of ringing again though not as much but also periods of head pressure and pain if resting head on hands etc. ---------------------------  Week 5 Muscle spasms in both arms lasting a couple minutes, finger twitching on left hand.  Also had muscle spasms in legs since.  ENT visit June 2nd: Audiologist tested hearing and saw no issues. ENT  gave me an exam and did not find any issues with the Eustachian tube or any other problems.  Suggested to do see if the symptoms continue to lessen and if they dont then do a VNG test and if that doesn&#39;t provide anything that he would have to refer me to a Neurologist next to see if they can find anything.  After the visit I came upon a web site and found that there are 300 pages of other people posting having the same symptoms as I have been experiencing for varying lengths of time, some upwards of 10 weeks. https://vestibular.org/forum/dizziness/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/ At this point I am absolutely convinced my issues have been as a result of some sort of reaction from the covid vaccine. There are way too many people having the same issues in a similar timeframe for not to be true.  In the few weeks since I still have symptoms that come and go but don&#39;t last nearly as long when they do. However it can still be quite disruptive depending on the circumstance.

Training period was 4 days after vaccination, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) began 48 hours after exercise and soreness remained intense for 24 hours, then began to resemble normal DOMS thereafter (but still abnormal for moderate exercise).  Symptoms were particularly noted for the pectoral muscles after a chest workout, including intense pain while performing normal day-to-day functions (sitting, standing, bending up/down and left/right, lying down for bed).  Symptoms persisted for ~24 hours, then began to subside and became more easily manageable.  Workout consisted of light weights (&lt;50% one rep max) and high repetitions (15-20 reps), which is my normal routine (performed regularly for years).

This 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899), intramuscular in left arm (IM in left shoulder) on 22Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. None medical history nor concomitant medications. Three hours after the vaccine (on 22Dec2020) patient started developing nausea that was pretty much and it was enough that patient had to stay at home instead of going out to shoot golf balls, it was so significant nausea. Then he had some extreme fatigue, muscle ache/muscle pain, started developing cough, sore throat and headache. Then all of his joints were painful.

                                                A few hours after injection, I began having discomfort in my left shoulder, the location of the injection.  Over the following next few hours I began to have overall body aches and pains in my joints.  My skin became extremely sensitive to the touch, a very strange hard to describe sensation.  I then began to get the chills, and running a fever.  Ultimately my fever spiked at 104 degrees.   I took a cold bath to bring the fever down, and for the rest of the night seesawed back and forth with fever using cold compresses and no sheets on my bed to keep my fever down.  I also took one 200 Mg Ib-Profen.  At roughly 26 hours after the injection, I no longer have a fever, but the body aches persist.

A 39-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0140), intramuscular on 20Dec2020 08:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications in two weeks included multivitamins. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. No known allergies to medications, food, or other products. On 22Dec2020 at approximately 19:15, the patient experienced sudden onset of severe stabbing-shooting lower back pain that radiated to both legs. Pricking, pins and needles sensations in the hands and feet. Coordination problems, unsteadiness, numbness, and weakness to both legs but mostly the right leg. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures post-vaccination which included nasal swab for covid test: negative on 30Dec2020 (Antigen Test). Adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, disability or permanent damage. Patient received pain medication, steroid dose pack, MRI (pending), and physical therapy (pending) as treatment. Outcome of all events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, a contributory role of vaccination with BNT162B2 in the onset of the events cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 39-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686) intramuscularly in the right arm on 11Jan2021 at 8:30 (at the age of 39-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history included hypertension and migraines. The patient does not have allergies to medication, food, or other products. Historical vaccinations included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Lot number EK5730) in the right arm on 18Dec2020. Prior to vaccination, the patient had not been diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was administered the vaccine in a Hospital. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Beginning on 14Jan2021 the patient started to experience dysaesthesia in the right arm (upper arm on the posterior aspect and forearm) and right hip/thigh. Discomfort feels like pins/needles sensation anytime skin is touched lightly (such as blankets, clothing etc). As of the reporting date, the symptoms persist. In addition, the right shoulder, right elbow, and right hip joints are mildly sore which also are persistent. No perceived muscle weakness and no associated numbness. Treatment was not received for the events. Lab data included two post vaccination COVID 19 tests. A PCR nasal swab test on 11Jan2021 and a PCR nasal swab test on 17Jan2021 both of which were negative for COVID-19. The clinical outcomes of dysaesthesia, joint soreness and pins and needles were reported as not recovered.

                                                I had a sore arm that lasted about three or four days. It made it hard to hold anything heavy or lift it above my head for one day. One week later, I developed severe hives, and itching all over my body and it didn&#39;t stop until about 24 hours later. I went to urgent care. They put me on Prednisone.

                                                Around 5:30am I woke up feeling as though I had not slept well. I had chills, then I would sweat, then I would have chills again. I had severe fatigue, and muscle aches centering in my lower back. I took my temperature and it was 100 degrees. I took Aleve and laid back down. My fever subsided, but I continued to intermittently feel chills throughout the day. I took a warm bath and shower. I felt exhausted and the ache in my back continued. I laid back down from 5-11pm and continued to feel chills, though not as severe as they had been. In the evening, beginning around 7, when I would get up I felt a chill and a wave of paranoia, affecting my mental stability. These would subside when I laid back down. I retired to bed at 11 and woke up at 5am completely drenched in sweat. I changed clothes and returned to bed. When I woke up at 7:30am for work, I felt much better and have felt fairly normal, except for being dehydrated, since.

This 39-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EL3247) via unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Feb2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 39-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number EL3247) in the left arm on 28Jan2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 39-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. On 18Feb2021 at 22:00 the patient experienced nausea, pain at the injection site, sore muscle in the upper back and shoulders, and tiredness. The events were reported as non-serious and did not require hospitalization. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The clinical outcomes of nausea, pain at the injection site, sore muscles in the upper back and shoulders, and tiredness were recovered in Feb2021. It was also reported that since vaccination the patient was not tested for COVID-19.

                                                Within an hour of the shot, started feeling dizzy.  Intense fatigue and full body aches set in within 3 hours.  Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours.  Low fever, chills, heavy heart beat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours.  Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours.  At ~4 days since the first shot, the facial numbness, heavy heart beat, and fatigue persisted, though the drooping became less prominent and the other symptoms have largely resolved.  At ~2 weeks since the first shot, the facial numbness has been constant, but varying in intensity, and the left-side facial drooping has returned multiple times.

It hurts to straighten my arm out. It hurts to bring my fist to my shoulder. It hurts to clench my fist tight. It&#39;s affecting my capabilites at work. I delayed reporting it because I thought it was just from getting a shot and would pass.

                                                I received the 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine on 3/31/21 at  High School. Within a few minutes of receiving the shot, I started to have muscle cramps in my calves and arms, joint pain, general feeling of anxiousness and jitteriness. My right hand started to shake and it was difficult to completely control the use of my fingers on my right hand. It was difficult to hold onto a water bottle cap or pick up my iPhone to call my wife. It was like I temporarily lost some fine motor skills in the fingers of my right hand. Overall, this lasted for more than 30 minutes. I drove to get the vaccine by myself, however my wife had to drive me home. We got home about an hour after the shot. When I got home I changed into looser fitting clothing and felt much better. I did not need medical attention.  On 4/6 I had similar symptoms but not as strong so I contacted my dr. They advised to get a Covid 19 test today.

                                                Same as the first shot, however, the adverse effects started shortly after the 2nd shot (within 2 hours after 2nd shot, vs 12 hours after the 1st shot). The symptoms are as follows: Severe headache, severe fatigue and muscle ache, shortness of breath and mild dizziness.  Muscle pain is more noticeable at joints (knees, shoulder cuffs, ankles).  I probably couldn&#39;t walk more than 2 blocks before having to sit down and catch my breath. I probably can&#39;t stand for more than 5 minutes,  and most definitely not in a shape to be able to work (office /engineering). It is hard to pin point, but I would probably say my mind is foggy and not as sharp. However I can quantify this.  The above symptoms lasted 5 days after the first shot, however,  it took up to 14 days before I recovered from general fatigue.   As for second dose, I am filling this form 5 hours post injection.  Considering the severity and early onset of symptoms (compared to 1st dose) I can predict uneasy days to follow.  Note, I am 178cm, and 76Kgs and do not have health issues. My pain tolerance is much higher than an average person.

                                                In the Morning after my shot, I was getting breakfast ready for my kids. Everything seemed fine at the time and I started getting an odd feeling. Not really a dizzy or lightheaded feeling, but an odd feeling. The next thing I know, I came to on the floor. My security camera in the living room caught part of it from down a hall. I fell strait forward, onto my stomach with a large crash. The rest of the day, I did feel fatigue, joint pain in my knees and then chills/hot flashes later in the day/evening. The next morning (Friday) I woke up with a scratchy throat but felt fine the rest of the day.  I  have never fainted in the past. I don&#39;t know what would bring that on.  I also have not had that feeling or any fainting spells since that incident. My wife came home about 8am out of concern.

                                                The patient had a sore throat for two days followed by severe polyarthralgias (pain in all of his joints) and fatigue. I sent him for evaluation in ER or urgent care.  I suspect the possibility that this illness is possibly vaccine related but that is uncertain as there could be other explanations. He had his second immunization 3 weeks ago. He thinks he had covid 19 in March 2020 and had trouble &#34;with his lungs&#34; for about 3 months. An antibody test in September 2020 did not show antibodies to covid 19.

A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm left on 16Feb2021 09:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN 5318) (at the age of 39-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included none. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included desvenlafaxine succinate (PRISTIQ) 50 mg ER taken for an unspecified indication, from an unknown start date (two weeks prior to vaccination). The patient previously received BNT162B2 (Batch/Lot Number: EN 5318) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 26Jan2021 at 12:00 for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On the day when patient received second dose on 16Feb2021 at 21:00, he felt strong soreness at the injection site (left arm) and began feeling chills by the time he went to bed (12 hours after receiving the vaccine), but no other symptoms. On the following day (17Feb2021) when he woke up, he experienced a multitude of symptoms, including headache, sore muscles throughout my body, alternating sense of hot/cold, and general fatigue. These symptoms continued most of the day but began to subside by that evening. No treatment was given for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered on 18Feb2021.

Went to healthcare facility to check if should still get 2nd shot they told me I would need to see a neurologist. I got the 2nd shot 3 weeks after first shot and now issue spread into my neck muscles and leg cramps. Seems to be worse when it rains. Told me take anti-inflammatory but no help. My doctor gave me muscle relaxers neither has helped try ice and heat. Arm still burns. Took xrays. But I couldn?t get appointment with neurology til mid May.

Observed a burning sensation in upper right pectoral major  that moved through right armpit at boundary between biceps brachii and right deltoid. Felt tight during arm movements sway from torso and over head, bringing medium severity burning and tugging sensations under skin. Suspected lymph node irritation from 1st Pfizer shot or damage from moving heavy furniture. After 3-4 days the irritation in right pectoral ceased and burning and tight sensation in deltoid area lessened by approximately 50%. Today as I write this there is little of this persisting - only noticeable in right deltoid area when moving right arm to the most extreme limits of its possible positions, such as above and behind head. This produces a minor burning and tugging sensation in the right deltoid area which encourages slow and careful movement to this extreme position.

                                                I had difficulty swallowing with pain in my neck. I had a severe headache and was extremely fatigued. It started Jan 8 2021 and it continued until I sought medical help from multiple physicians. I had a headache for over 90 straight days. I had a nogol in my neck, it ended up being diagnosed as acute thyroiditis.  I am in a lull right now after I was able to stop the medicine. My thyroid is functioning again, but we are waiting for it to go into the hyper thyroid stage.

On 5/17 smaller itchy bumps had spread to my stomach and chest and I was evaluated by PCP, who directed me to take Zyrtec and apply Eucerin. By 5/19 smaller itchy bumps had spread to my arms, and my right ankle and foot had started swelling. PCP prescribed a course of antibiotics as a precaution.  By 5/21 rash had spread to my back and continued in all other locations. On 5/21 dermatologist prescribed oral steroids (prednisone) and topical triamcinolone.   Swelling in leg subsided after a few days. Itching was reduced but still present through to June 1.

                                                Approximately 3 weeks following  receipt of first COVID vaccine, on 5/5/2021, was talking a walk when experienced a &#34;warm splashing&#34; feeling on one calf.  Following the walk, a pulsating feeling occurred in both feet, hours after the walk.  The pulsating feeling in the feet migrated to behind both knees and continued in both feet.  This feeling is not continual but persistent.  The feeling &#34;moves around&#34; the legs and the following day that area will be sore.  On May 13, received second dose of Pfizer vaccine; the leg feeling remains constant but has lessened in severity, but some days the feeling worsens.  Following second vaccine also began to have pain in the elbow area of both arms, but &#34;mostly in the left&#34;.  Had one episode of the feeling extending into the bicep area.  Has been to the doctor twice.  First visit blood panel and Lyme Disease test obtained.  Blood work was normal, except for slightly elevated liver enzyme which client attributed to some pain medication that had been taken.  On June 18th, had Ultra Sound of legs performed for vascular study; has not heard results. States contacted testing facility and results had not been sent to his ordering physician, but &#34;someone there are read the report&#34; and supposedly normal.  Is scheduled for an EMG on 6/24/21.  Encouraged client to monitor symptoms and if leg pain / spasm worsen or other symptoms arise, to seek out ER care.

This resolved after a few days after taking antihistamines (Diphenhydramine). About 2 weeks after vaccine I experienced significant chest pain, shallow breathing, very tense neck muscles, heart pounding at times, could not sleep or find position that would give any relief. Thought it was possible onset of a heart attack but was not experiencing any pain down left arm at all. Took both asprin and antacids which did not seem to grant much relief. By morning the symptoms became more manageable so I did not seek medical care. It took about 5-6 days for symptoms to fully resolve. Have not experienced any of the same symptoms since.

                                                4 days after the covid-19 vaccine 2nd dose, I have severe pain started in the left back neck. The pain started from the neck and goes up to back left head, head above the ear and left ear. Left part of neck becomes stiff. The head pain is burning. If someone touches the pain points in the head, I don&#39;t have a pressing pain but still have a burning pain.  Initially though it was due to a sleeping position(pillow) change. But as day progressed, pain increased and saw left armpit swelled. Went to a walking clinic and Dr. said it is due to muscular pain and asked me to take over-the counter pain killer.   I took the pain killer and pain reduced but when I stopped the medication, pain reappeared.   I also found a pattern in the pain. Neck stiffness and pain starts at around 2:00 pm and it increases to 8/9 at around 3:00 to 3:30. The pain at peak is extreme pulsive burning pain and automatically reduces at around 4:30 pm to level 2/3. This happens every day. I always have pain of 2/3 during the throughout the day.  Revisited the Same walk-in clinic and other Dr. said, It might be possibly linked to the Vaccine and they have few more similar cases reported. She prescribed me the Muscle relaxer and steroid and suggested me to contact my PCP for few blood work. I didn&#39;t take any of them before contacting my PCP.  PCP ordered some blood work and CTScan. Suggested me to take muscle relaxer and not to take Steroid as It will reduce the vaccine effect.  The Blood and CTScan report came normal. She also referred me to Neurologist.  Neurologist also looked at report and said, everything looks normal.  I took muscle relaxer. Neck stiffness and  head pain is reduced but I still have pain. It repeats at the same time interval and in same manner
