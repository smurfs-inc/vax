                                                Myalgias starting within 1 hour after vaccination, worsened throughout day that radiated to ipsilateral trapezius and rhomboid areas.  Starting around 16 hours after vaccination, severe subjective fevers and chills with severe headache that worsened with lying down. The headache was the most concerning symptom with tinnitus when laying flat in supine. It awoke me from sleep and prevented me from laying flat so I had to sleep upright on the couch. I took tylenol 500mg around 0200 and was able to sleep for a few hours. By 24 hours post vaccine, the headache and fevers/chills significantly improved so I could attend work the next day.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly in unknown arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for routine mass immunizations (covid-19 immunization). The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Not a military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none and concomitant medications was none (he was on no other medications). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced tachycardia, intermittent palpitations, low grade fever/fever all started somewhere in the morning of 18Dec2020 and muscle aches on 17Dec2020. Physician assessed tachycardia and intermittent palpitations as serious due to medically significant. Physician stated that one of his workers had the vaccine and proceeded to have tachycardia and low grade fever. He would like to know if patient should get the second dose. The patient had mostly tachycardia with some intermittent palpitations. Patient was seen in his office on 18Dec2020, and got the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020. He also reported fever and muscle aches, although the fever was subjective and was not documented. Tachycardia improved and sent him to cardiology on 21Dec2020. It was not life threatening and they did an Electrocardiogram (EKG). His initial heart rate was 130. When he was seen again in their office on 21Dec2020, it was 93, which was baseline. It improved. He never got his temperature. The highest in office was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He had some muscle aches. The physician just sent patient to cardiology because he was having intermittent tachycardia and intermittent palpitations. Two visits to physician office. He was seen on 18Dec2020 and again on 21Dec2020. Relevant tests: they did testing for tachycardia but not related specifically. They did thyroid and EKG in office and he did not know if test were back. EKG was ok. The Thyroid, Complete blood count (CBC) and lipid (all were on an unknown date in Dec2020) were not back and were just done to make sure there were no cardiac issues. The outcome of the events was recovering. The lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events tachycardia and palpitations cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                A few hours after my second dose on 1/08/2021, I had some adverse reactions that worried me, including arm numbness, tingling around my mouth and cheeks, a splitting headache/blurry vision, joint and muscle pain and dizziness. I called e-medicine and had a video call with a E-Medicine provider who told me to keep monitoring my symtoms and go to the ER if they got worse (fortunately they didn&#39;t); however there are some lingering effects. Currently I still am experiencing headaches (around my ears and temple area) with joint pain/body aches and occasional tingling/burning sensations in my fingers and feet.

Later that same day I experienced fatigue and loss of appetite that lasted about 24 hours.

                                                Symptoms of 2nd Covid vaccine lot EL 1284: numbness in feet, legs throbbing, muscle weakness in legs, overall tiredness  I received my second Pfizer vaccine on 1/12/21 at 12:15 pm.  After several hours, I felt weak and tired.  By 7:00 pm, I had a migraine that wouldn?t go away and I had muscle ache in my feet and legs.  On 1/13/21 I felt some numbness in my feet and my legs were throbbing.  By 10:00 pm, both of my feet were completely numb and my legs were throbbing/radiating heat.  It felt as if circulation was cut off from my feet entirely.  On 1/14/21 I went into work where I?m constantly on my feet.  I felt intense muscle weakness in my legs and thighs to point where I could barely stand up.  I immediately went to an urgent care where they started me on an Sodium Chloride 0.9% intravenous IV solution drip.  They ran blood tests and urine tests to rule out any other causes to my symptoms.  All results came back negative.  I was told to rest, hydrate, and recover for the next several days.  If my symptoms did not subside within the next couple days, I was instructed to go to the ER for further examination.

After 5-6 minutes he notes a syncopal episode that he describes as feeling like he randomly fell asleep. When this occurred, he fell back in his chair and hit his head.

While he was being brought to the ED in a wheelchair he began experiencing blurry vision again and his face became very pale. He was given some apple juice and reports that after 5-10 minutes he felt back to normal. While his vitals were being taken, his HR and BP were very low and he experienced another episode. Pt does not have a hx of passing out 2/2 needles and notes that he gets a flu shot every year and is totally fine. He does note that he became queasy when he tried to give blood in the past but that this does not normally happen. Of note, pt denies any leg swelling prior to these episodes.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Cervical and clavicular lymphadenopathy on the left side; Some tenderness in neck; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 29-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 17Dec2020 at 11:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the hospital. On 27Dec2020, the patient experienced cervical and clavicular lymphadenopathy on the left side (same side as the vaccine shot was received). The patient first noticed some tenderness in neck about 10 days after vaccine was administered. The events were considered non-serious. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient had not recovered from the events.   Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

A 29-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EK4176) in the hospital, via intramuscular route on 10Feb2021 at 10:30 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from 2010 to 2011 and allergies to penicillin on an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to vaccination, was the patient not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: H9899) in the hospital, via intramuscular route at 01:15 PM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that on 12Feb2021 at 08:00 PM (also reported as &#39;3 days after injection&#39;) the patient experienced flu-like symptoms that included fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, and a persistent headache. On 13Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 4th day&#39;, the patient developed pleurisy and difficulty breathing and had 2 syncope events the morning of 14Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 5th day&#39;). The patient was taken by ambulance and admitted to ER for further testing. It was determined that all symptoms likely related to the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine recently received. Pleurisy persists one week following vaccine dose. The patient went to the emergency room/department or urgent care due to the events. As treatment for the event, the patient was monitored and given IV fluids over 12 hour stay in CDU. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae (reported as recovered with lasting effects). The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile.

                                                Uncertain if truly caused by the vaccine.  I had an ACL reconstruction done back in May of 2020.  My knee has transient swelling that comes and goes, but is not particularly frequent.  3 days after receiving the vaccine, my knee swelled up and remained swollen for about 7 days.  It has since gone back down.  I did not have any acute injuries or remarkable events happen during this time other than the vaccine administration.  Overall, uncertain if it was caused by vaccine, but it was odd enough to report.

                                                20 hours after injection, I started having progressively worsening severe back pain, neck pain, headache, chills (no fever), skin sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, and brain fog. 2 days after the vaccine, I had abdominal pain, and cough. All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

                                                In the evening after getting the shot, I started getting chills and became more sensitive to cold temperatures.  Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

A 30-year-old male patient received second dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization (reported as &#34;I guess to protect myself from other people, to protect myself&#34;). There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient took his first dose on 20Dec2020, 3 weeks from there, he took the second on 10Jan2021 (reported as &#34;it was 10th it was Sunday morning when I took it&#34;). The patient reported that he had his second dose on Sunday morning (10Jan2021) and started feeling tired last Monday (11Jan2021). Then on 12Jan2021 (reported as &#34;yesterday&#34; at the time of reporting), he started to feel his chest and neck hurting. The patient stated that he woke up in the middle of the night (Sunday night) and Monday morning, he was feeling really sick so he called out rest all day on Monday (11Jan2021). Then patient woke up yesterday morning (12Jan2021) feeling good then probably about 6 o&#39;clock last night he started feeling tired, like real bad tired and he got home. Patient lied down and woke up in middle of night, his chest, arms and head were hurting. His neck and all around head area were hurting real bad. The events were assessed as non-serious. The patient does not have the lot number but stated that it was the Pfizer vaccine. When the patient was asked if still experiencing tiredness and chest hurting, he stated &#34;When I started, that was last night on I will go with the 12 before midnight 12 (not clear). Yes right now yeah. This is the first time my chest and my arms and my neck and like all that has been hurting, started last night&#34;. When asked for the treatment, the patient answered &#34;I took Ibuprofen to calm it down a little bit. I took Ibuprofen if you count that as a treatment&#34;. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

I went to the ER and was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer (the patient). A 31-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6201) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 21Feb2021 11:30 a.m. at age of 31-year-old, at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had history of frequent ear infections. Concomitant medication included fluticasone which was taken within 2 weeks of vaccination for an unspecified indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient reported when he woke up the next day after receiving the vaccine (22Feb2021), he found that he was suffering from paralysis and numbness on the left side of his face. He went to the emergency room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. He had been experiencing some minor pain in his left ear beginning two days before he received the vaccine (i.e., three days before onset of facial paralysis), and this ear pain had continued as he continue to experience the palsy. Since visiting the ER, he had also seen a neurologist. The doctors he had seen do not necessarily think that the palsy resulted from receiving the vaccine. The onset date of the event &#34;I was suffering from paralysis and numbness on the left side of my face. I went to the ER and was diagnosed with bell&#39;s palsy&#34; was reported as 22Feb2021 09:00 a.m. The event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The event was non-serious (the event did not result in death, not life threatening, not caused/prolonged hospitalization, no disabling/Incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect). Oral steroid and antiviral drugs, eye ointment was received to treat the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. The patient experienced swelling in left arm/thumb and numbness from tip of thumb to joint on opposite limb of administration.  Since Wednesday, 23Dec2020, he has been experiencing some numbness in the arm opposite of where the vaccine was administered. He clarifies the vaccine was administered in the deltoid of his right arm, and the numbness he is experiencing is in his left hand. His thumb has been partially numb since last Wednesday. He got a little bit of tingling in his left arm since last Wednesday (23Dec2020).The patient explains on Tuesday, 22Dec2020, when he was administered the vaccine he only had typical side effects that went away within 24 hours. He experienced headache and muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was administered. Both of these symptoms went away and he has recovered completely. After 24-36 hours, he noticed numbness on hand opposite of the arm where the vaccine was administered. His thumb has been partially numb which has lasted about 6 days. He clarifies the numbness is on the palm side- which he was told was not related to the nerve. His thumb looks swollen and inflamed compared to the other. He also has noticed muscle weakness in the opposite arm. The patient states he can&#39;t recall if the numbness occurred within 24 hours but he knows by 24 hours, he did have the numbness. His thumb is partially numb on the side of the palm and up to the middle of his thumb where the joint is.Patient states yesterday the numbness was noticeably worse when he was sleeping. However, today the numbness seems to be back where it was before. He forgets about the numbness since he is not actively doing anything with that particular hand, but he doesn&#39;t forget about it completely. The numbness hasn&#39;t improved any, it&#39;s been consistently there and never went away. While reading off of his card, the patient cannot determine if the Lot number is an F or an E because the number is underlined. He thinks it might be an E. Patient was able to confirm the Lot number begins with an E after looking at the information sheet he was provided. He also sees the product number, CVX 208. Patient states he has no allergic reactions and nothing that he knows of that is an underlying condition. Patient states he hasn&#39;t had any testing done in regards to these events. He wanted to talk to the manufacturer and report it to the (Contact center name) first before he schedules something at Urgent Care. He wanted to check and see if what he is experiencing is a lesser known symptom. He couldn&#39;t find this information anywhere. The outcome of events, headache and muscle soreness was recovered on 23Dec2020. The outcome of Numbness in hand was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

I was forwarned that the first dose primes the immune system, 2nd can be worse, so I was taking 600 mg Motrin q6 hours. Despite that, my arm progressively hurt worse and worse until now I can?t lift it above my waist. Full body aches and pains. Horrible chills and so cold. 102.1 F is highest temp so far, but that?s on top of scheduled Motrin.   Still glad that I got it, but man does it suck right now.

This neurologic diagnosis was not reported by the patient during the consent process with the COVID19 vaccination center staff.  Confirmed following review of the consent form.  Documentation from Emergency Department Provider:  Patient is serially reassessed following treatment for anaphylaxis.  Patient has significant improvement in diffuse erythema and hives within 20 minutes.  He has gradual improvement in his sensation of throat swelling.  He is observed while in the emergency department serially over 4 hours with no recurrence of symptoms.  He does not require any repeat dose of epinephrine and feels at baseline.  Discussed my suspicions that patient may have had a reaction to COVID-19 vaccine as he has had no other new medications or exposures that he is aware of.  As he will not be receiving another vaccine there is nothing to necessarily stay away from.  Make sure he notifies individuals about this for any new vaccine should he receive them.  Patient is observed for sufficient time but discussed possibility for biphasic reaction.  Recommend he return should he have recurrence of symptoms.  Recommend he take EpiPen as prescribed for any throat swelling or progressive shortness of breath.  Recommend follow-up with a primary care provider for this visit..

Pt states that this is sudden onset today. he is unsure if it is related to the recent covid vaccine but has otherwise been well. He has no recent viral sx. He has no other neuro sx. He did have some pain in the jaw at the onset but that has since resolved. CT head obtained more for the jaw pain and to ensure no mass etc. It is normal. I discussed at length with the pt that I suspect this is bells palsy as he has very minimal movement of the forehead, cannot fully blink the L eye closed and has no risk factors for stroke. I did offer him further imaging to make 100% sure this is not a stroke but he agrees that he feels he has bells palsy and declined further labs or imaging. i will have him f/u with ENT as an OP. Given return precautions and f/u with them in the office. Given first dose of steroids and valacyclovir here. He will use artificial tears and tape the eye at night. .

                                                Following the first COVID vaccine dose on Dec/18/2020, I had headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day.  The headaches were usually light, unilateral, and alternating from one side to the other. I was usually functional except on the fourth and seventh days where the headaches were moderate to severe, and I took naps to help with the headaches for those two days. I have never had an issue with headaches before, and these symptoms were a new experience for me. I did not take any medications as treatment for the headaches. Following the second COVID vaccine dose on January/7/2021, I felt fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On January/10/2021, when I woke up that morning I again felt light, unilateral, and alternating headaches. In addition, I noticed that I was unable to move the left side of my face. I felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When I looked in the mirror, I could quite noticeably see asymmetry in my face. I immediately went to the emergency department at the hospital where my primary care doctor is located. I was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation. After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, I was provided with the diagnosis of Bells Palsy. I have never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and I have never previously had a hospital stay before. The doctors prescribed medications which I am currently taking. As of today January/12/2021, the symptoms have had some improvement, but the symptoms still continue.

At about 8:30PM, I started to get chills and started to have muscle soreness all throughout my body (shoulders, arms, back, legs, abdomen, etc.). I went to bed at about 11:30PM with the soreness and chills. I woke up at about 7AM and the chills had resolved. The muscles soreness and now a headache remained up until about 5:30PM on Saturday 1/9/21. After that, I felt right back to normal.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

A 32-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3246) on 07Jan2021 at 09:00 a.m. intramuscular on left deltoid, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included omeprazole. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 at 09:00 on left arm (lot number: EK5730) and experienced headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day. Following the second dose on 07Jan2021, patient experienced fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On 10Jan2021, he noticed that was unable to move the left side of his face. He felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When looked in the mirror, he could quite noticeably see asymmetry in his face. Patient immediately visited emergency department at the hospital where his primary care doctor was located. Patient was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation (as reported). After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, patient was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He had never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and never previously had a hospital stay before. It was also informed that patient underwent Nasal Swab for SARS-CoV-2 test on an unspecified date in Dec2020 and on 10Jan2021, both resulted negative. At the time of the reporting, the symptoms continued.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of diagnosed Bells Palsy presented as unable to move the left side of his face/felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis/asymmetry in his face cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I am a pharmacist with a healthcare system and they have been offering the Pfizer/Biontech COVID-19 vaccine for essential associates. I received by first dose of vaccine on 12/31/20. On 1/1/20 I woke up with very noticeable muscle aches and fairly profound lethargy, which last 18-20 hours. I was not able to do much on 1/1/21 because of the way I was feeling. I&#39;m not sure if this reaction is normal for patients who receive their COVID-19 vaccine close to their illness/infection with COVID-19, which is why I&#39;m reporting this to the FDA.

Second shot same as above but starting 24 hours after vaccine I developed left axillary pain. Able to palpate a lymph node ~1cm. Very painful on palpation. Has not limited activity but still painful. Was difficult to fall asleep  2 nights after vaccine. Now day 2 after vaccine still hurts, maybe incrementally better but taking ibuprofen. Cannot palpate significant lymphadenopathy otherwise.  No fever. I am a physician.

Those stopped by the second day morning (day after vaccine). However, in the second morning ( day after vaccine) I started having pain on left side of neck and on Trapezius muscle on left shoulder blade - and had that pain for three more days. Range of motion for neck restricted for three days. All symptoms improved after four days. I took Lidocaine patch and Tylenol for neck and shoulder blade pain.

Approximately 10 hours after vaccination i felt very fatigued and tired and went to bed early. Approximately 12 hours after vaccination I woke from sleep with fevers (101.8), chills, and headache. I took tylenol, fever subsided,  and was able to return to sleep at approximately  4:00AM. I woke at 6:30AM with headache, dizziness, and fever (99-100).  I took more tylenol and fever and headache subsided. For remainder of day temperature would start in increase, but stayed below 99, and headache would return between doses of tylenol. I slept through the night of 1/9/2021 and woke 1/10/2021 without fever or headache, although I would experience dizziness with exertion above level of walking.  Today, 1/11/2021, I am not experiencing any symptoms.

Couldn&#39;t abduct arm for about 24 hours due to pain.  Very faint red rash a few inches below injection site that goes across arm.  Arm is moderately itchy and has been since Monday 1/18/21.  Arm feels tight and is still pretty sore when reaching out and stretching it above my head.   No redness, itchiness, or discomfort around injection site.  Everything is in the middle of the upper arm.  The itchiness and prolonged soreness are my concerns, considering I still need a 2nd dose.

Received vax and went home, slept 7 hours, got up and had an extremely strenuous workout including deadlifts (pyramid to heavy weight, 275lb x 5 reps in HIIT sets with kettlebell swings, and boxing in garage gym. Was 45 dF at the time. Patient was finishing workout with last 2 minutes boxing on a 100lb heavy bag and suddenly felt violent &#34;pop&#34; in right medial gastrocnemius muscle. Pt stopped workout and could barely put weight on right leg and reported back to work for shift within 45 minutes of event.

Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was reported as &#39;None&#39; and AEs following prior vaccinations was reported as &#39;None&#39;. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was reported as None. The patient experienced really bad chills, body aches, fever, unable to sleep on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, passed out on bathroom floor for 5-10 seconds, sweating and neck was stiff on 01Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, headache on an unspecified data with outcome of unknown.  Details were as follows: the patient received the Covi-19 vaccine 30Dec2021. He had a reaction to the vaccine. 24 hours after getting the vaccine he had really bad chills, body aches, fever 100.4. He didn&#39;t take any medication for a bit. He then took acetaminophen (TYLENOL). He had a headache, he was unable to sleep. The acetaminophen worked and he went to bed. At 5:00 am he started having a bad headache and took Ibuprofen. He woke up to go to the bathroom. He passed out for 5-10 seconds in the bathroom. His head was leaning in the wall by the door. He was sweating and was stiff all over. He went to the Emergency Room on 01Jan2021. They did an X-ray and a CT scan. They gave him 100ml of saline and some pills. They also did some lab work. Everything was negative. They assumed his body couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. He was supposed to have received the second shot yesterday (20Jan2021). Employee Health said his Primary Care Physician would have to make the decision on him taking it or not. His doctor said he would have to do more research with Pfizer before he says if he can take it or not. Emergency Room visit required due to event passing out.

Had first COVID-19 vaccination on 2/13.  Cannot exclude paraneoplastic syndrome; possible hilar mass noted on CXR will need further work-up to rule out sarcoid/malignancy. Concern for viral meningitis.  No known sick contacts. Another tonic-clonic seizure occurred around 08:00 on 2/24 AM with vomiting; no overt aspiration though certainly high risk given situation.&#34;

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I felt myself get very flushed and slightly lightheaded.  This feeling lasted for about 45 minutes before resolving.  Had right shoulder pain start about 1-2 hours after the vaccine and it steadily increased to the point where it was too painful to move in certain ways that utilized that muscle.  I had to assist my right arm with my left when needing to move it in certain ways between 12-36 hours after the vaccine was received.  The pain dissipated to manageable levels after 48 hours post vaccination and resolved completely after about a week.  Also experienced significant fatigue that started 3-4 hours after the vaccination.  the first night after the vaccination I slept for 12 hours and the second night I slept for 10 hours.  I was still able to go to work which does not involve too much labor and alot of computer work.  Once home I did essentially nothing except rest on the couch or in bed.  When I woke up on the third day the fatigue was mostly gone.  It was completely resolved on the 4th day.

This 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899), intramuscular in left arm (IM in left shoulder) on 22Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. None medical history nor concomitant medications. Three hours after the vaccine (on 22Dec2020) patient started developing nausea that was pretty much and it was enough that patient had to stay at home instead of going out to shoot golf balls, it was so significant nausea. Then he had some extreme fatigue, muscle ache/muscle pain, started developing cough, sore throat and headache. Then all of his joints were painful. Patient had a mild discomfort the day after at the injection site. The next day (on 23Dec2020) when he woke up nausea was gone.

                                                A few hours after injection, I began having discomfort in my left shoulder, the location of the injection.  Over the following next few hours I began to have overall body aches and pains in my joints.  My skin became extremely sensitive to the touch, a very strange hard to describe sensation.  I then began to get the chills, and running a fever.  Ultimately my fever spiked at 104 degrees.   I took a cold bath to bring the fever down, and for the rest of the night seesawed back and forth with fever using cold compresses and no sheets on my bed to keep my fever down.  I also took one 200 Mg Ib-Profen.  At roughly 26 hours after the injection, I no longer have a fever, but the body aches persist.

A 39-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0140), intramuscular on 20Dec2020 08:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications in two weeks included multivitamins. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. No known allergies to medications, food, or other products. On 22Dec2020 at approximately 19:15, the patient experienced sudden onset of severe stabbing-shooting lower back pain that radiated to both legs. Pricking, pins and needles sensations in the hands and feet. Coordination problems, unsteadiness, numbness, and weakness to both legs but mostly the right leg. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures post-vaccination which included nasal swab for covid test: negative on 30Dec2020 (Antigen Test). Adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, disability or permanent damage. Patient received pain medication, steroid dose pack, MRI (pending), and physical therapy (pending) as treatment. Outcome of all events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, a contributory role of vaccination with BNT162B2 in the onset of the events cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient was evaluated at Urgent Care yesterday and sent by the NP. Patient reports three days of rash to the left side of his face with redness and swelling. The patient initially thought the rash was acne due to his face mask. There is intermittent pain to the area which is rated 10/10 severity at its worst. The patient has been unable to sleep the past two days due to the pain. Pain is worse with cold weather and at night with increased clenching of his jaw and grinding of his teeth. He was prescribed Valtrex at Urgent Care and took one dose just PTA to the ED. There is concern given a bump just lateral to the patient&#39;s left eye. The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccination on 01/18/2021 and explains that the Urgent Care provider believes this may be an adverse reaction.
