                                                Myalgias starting within 1 hour after vaccination, worsened throughout day that radiated to ipsilateral trapezius and rhomboid areas.  Starting around 16 hours after vaccination, severe subjective fevers and chills with severe headache that worsened with lying down. The headache was the most concerning symptom with tinnitus when laying flat in supine. It awoke me from sleep and prevented me from laying flat so I had to sleep upright on the couch. I took tylenol 500mg around 0200 and was able to sleep for a few hours. By 24 hours post vaccine, the headache and fevers/chills significantly improved so I could attend work the next day.

A 26-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EK9231; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 20:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. He received his first dose (age of vaccination was 26-year-old) of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EH9899; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s family history included his father has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine in a university hospital which set up a clinic. The patient reported that he thought he got his second dose last night at about 8 pm and since then in the morning around 8 am, so about 12 hours after he started having flu like symptoms that got pretty bad one point. He took some acetaminophen (TYLENOL) so it has gotten better but he was having myalgia, headache, fever, chills and nausea. The patient further mentioned that first, he started having chills around 8 am in the morning. He had chills before but now he kind of overheated and now he is not under a blanket anymore, so he thinks that is improved. He then started having nausea, then myalgia and then everything kind of got bad all at once. He mentioned that over all everything has improved except the headache. He further added that everything has not gone away complete but improved significantly. Earlier today (14Jan2021) like 2-3 hours ago he would say it was a 7 or 8 on a scale of 0-10 but right now it is about 4 on a scale of 0-10 and that goes for everything. He does not think anything else is confounding, he is not on any medications and has no chronic health problems, there has been no labs drawn. The patient did not visit an emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the outcome of the event headache was unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovering.

This rash appeared within a week or so of getting the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Over the next few weeks the rash slowly faded (not completely, though). When I woke up the morning after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, the rash doubled in coverage in the same areas of my body.   Around the time the rash showed up, I also began experiencing lower to mid-back pain, which grew more severe over time. The back pain is worst in the morning after sleeping, or after sitting/resting for longer periods of time. I&#39;ve been taking Ibuprofen and Aleve, which helps, as does being active. The back pain did not noticeably worsen after the second dose, but it is just as severe.   Currently, the rash has faded (not completely), and my back pain is still quite bothersome.

The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced tachycardia, intermittent palpitations, low grade fever/fever all started somewhere in the morning of 18Dec2020 and muscle aches on 17Dec2020. Physician assessed tachycardia and intermittent palpitations as serious due to medically significant. Physician stated that one of his workers had the vaccine and proceeded to have tachycardia and low grade fever. He would like to know if patient should get the second dose. The patient had mostly tachycardia with some intermittent palpitations. Patient was seen in his office on 18Dec2020, and got the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020. He also reported fever and muscle aches, although the fever was subjective and was not documented. Tachycardia improved and sent him to cardiology on 21Dec2020. It was not life threatening and they did an Electrocardiogram (EKG). His initial heart rate was 130. When he was seen again in their office on 21Dec2020, it was 93, which was baseline. It improved. He never got his temperature. The highest in office was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He had some muscle aches. The physician just sent patient to cardiology because he was having intermittent tachycardia and intermittent palpitations. Two visits to physician office. He was seen on 18Dec2020 and again on 21Dec2020. Relevant tests: they did testing for tachycardia but not related specifically. They did thyroid and EKG in office and he did not know if test were back. EKG was ok. The Thyroid, Complete blood count (CBC) and lipid (all were on an unknown date in Dec2020) were not back and were just done to make sure there were no cardiac issues. The outcome of the events was recovering. The lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events tachycardia and palpitations cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

I called e-medicine and had a video call with a E-Medicine provider who told me to keep monitoring my symtoms and go to the ER if they got worse (fortunately they didn&#39;t); however there are some lingering effects. Currently I still am experiencing headaches (around my ears and temple area) with joint pain/body aches and occasional tingling/burning sensations in my fingers and feet.

For the rest of the day, I had mild myalgia, a mild to moderate headache and general malaise that resolved by the following morning (within 48 hours of vaccine administration)

Noted lymph swelling of my axillary lymph nodes with aching pain.  This has not gone away at current but improved with x1 dose of motrin.

                                                Symptoms of 2nd Covid vaccine lot EL 1284: numbness in feet, legs throbbing, muscle weakness in legs, overall tiredness  I received my second Pfizer vaccine on 1/12/21 at 12:15 pm.  After several hours, I felt weak and tired.  By 7:00 pm, I had a migraine that wouldn?t go away and I had muscle ache in my feet and legs.  On 1/13/21 I felt some numbness in my feet and my legs were throbbing.  By 10:00 pm, both of my feet were completely numb and my legs were throbbing/radiating heat.  It felt as if circulation was cut off from my feet entirely.  On 1/14/21 I went into work where I?m constantly on my feet.  I felt intense muscle weakness in my legs and thighs to point where I could barely stand up.  I immediately went to an urgent care where they started me on an Sodium Chloride 0.9% intravenous IV solution drip.  They ran blood tests and urine tests to rule out any other causes to my symptoms.  All results came back negative.  I was told to rest, hydrate, and recover for the next several days.  If my symptoms did not subside within the next couple days, I was instructed to go to the ER for further examination.

                                                Uncertain if truly caused by the vaccine.  I had an ACL reconstruction done back in May of 2020.  My knee has transient swelling that comes and goes, but is not particularly frequent.  3 days after receiving the vaccine, my knee swelled up and remained swollen for about 7 days.  It has since gone back down.  I did not have any acute injuries or remarkable events happen during this time other than the vaccine administration.  Overall, uncertain if it was caused by vaccine, but it was odd enough to report.

                                                20 hours after injection, I started having progressively worsening severe back pain, neck pain, headache, chills (no fever), skin sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, and brain fog. 2 days after the vaccine, I had abdominal pain, and cough. All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

By 3rd barely ate only had soup and a mild case of diarrhea ,  day face neck throat pain still and swelling , warm wash clothe hot fluids help with pain, 4 day cold things help reduces swelling in face and throat, neck still swollen and a lot more pain in face jaw , neck, still hard and painful to swallow. Current day a lot of pain in jaw neck throat face still only happening on left side of body more pain then before but less swelling neck still swollen a little bit. I tried cough drops soup heat ice and still having pain don?t want to pay for an ER visit found old painkillers haven?t taken yet. How long do symptoms like these last for ? I take medication for ADD and that masks pain to make it bearable. What do you recommend to do if I don?t want to go to the ER ?

A 30-year-old male patient received second dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization (reported as &#34;I guess to protect myself from other people, to protect myself&#34;). There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient took his first dose on 20Dec2020, 3 weeks from there, he took the second on 10Jan2021 (reported as &#34;it was 10th it was Sunday morning when I took it&#34;). The patient reported that he had his second dose on Sunday morning (10Jan2021) and started feeling tired last Monday (11Jan2021). Then on 12Jan2021 (reported as &#34;yesterday&#34; at the time of reporting), he started to feel his chest and neck hurting. The patient stated that he woke up in the middle of the night (Sunday night) and Monday morning, he was feeling really sick so he called out rest all day on Monday (11Jan2021). Then patient woke up yesterday morning (12Jan2021) feeling good then probably about 6 o&#39;clock last night he started feeling tired, like real bad tired and he got home. Patient lied down and woke up in middle of night, his chest, arms and head were hurting. His neck and all around head area were hurting real bad. The events were assessed as non-serious. The patient does not have the lot number but stated that it was the Pfizer vaccine. When the patient was asked if still experiencing tiredness and chest hurting, he stated &#34;When I started, that was last night on I will go with the 12 before midnight 12 (not clear). Yes right now yeah. This is the first time my chest and my arms and my neck and like all that has been hurting, started last night&#34;. When asked for the treatment, the patient answered &#34;I took Ibuprofen to calm it down a little bit. I took Ibuprofen if you count that as a treatment&#34;. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Also felt unusually anxious, though unsure if that was directly due to the vaccine or to the inability to sleep for a number of days because of the feverish chills. Acute symptoms lasted for 48 hours, and prohibited me from being able to work from home.   I still have what feels like a lingering sinus headache (with no actual sinus symptoms) as well as some fatigue. Lingering headache is not debilitating, but it is irritating. Feels a bit like a sensation of pressure in my forehead.

A 30-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot Not Provided, second dose) solution for injection intramuscular on an unknown date (at the age of 30-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Cystic Fibrosis and Autoimmune Necrotizing Myositis. Concomitant medications were unknown. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (first dose) for COVID-19 vaccination on an unknown date with no adverse effect reported (tolerated first COVID-19 vaccine). The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Less than 24 hours after second COVID-19 vaccine injection, the patient had severe polymyalgia. CPKs checked very high at 80,000. The patient was currently admitted to the hospital. Unspecified treatment was provided for the events severe polymyalgias and CPKs very high. The outcome of the events severe polymyalgias and CPKs very high was unknown. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was supposed to get RITUXAN as a regimen for his muscle disorder and was interested in Pfizer checking his neutralizing antibody level both pre and post Rituxan. The patient will receive RITUXAN shortly in the next week.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine causality between events severe polymyalgia and CPKs checked very high and  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE0 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 30-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: ER8730) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 31Mar2021 15:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroid. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium taken for hypothyroid. The patient previously received tetanus vaccine (6 weeks out from his Covid Vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient stated that his side effects began on 01Apr2021. He noticed tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck. This was the same side of the body he got the vaccine on. His symptoms worsened over the next two days. He had increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck. On Saturday 03Apr2021. it took him a half an hour just to get out of bed. Stated that he went to the Emergency Room at the hospital where he works and they did a series of tests. He had CAT Scans with and without contrast, a MRI, and an Ultrasound. Mentioned later that they also did blood work (Apr2021). The Emergency Room doctor told the caller he was going to have his CAT scan read by a specialist. Caller stated they called him on Sunday 04Apr2021 and said his CAT scan showed an inflammatory infectious process with atypical organisms and Lymphadenopathy. He stated that he read that Lymphadenopathy was a side effect of the vaccine. They told him that the Lymphadenopathy was compressing the nerves in his neck and causing his pain and decreased range of motion. He had been on a week of treatment consisting of pain medications, muscle relaxers, and anti-inflammatory medications. The Infectious Disease was consulted and he was started on a 5 day course of Azithromycin. He was on the third day of this antibiotic per his report. He has a follow up MRI scheduled next Friday. He was calling to report his side effects and also to ask about what he should do in regards to his appointment for his second dose of the vaccination. His symptoms were worsening for the first three days. Since he has been being treated for them they have started to improve slowly day by day. Today he said there was minimal pain and tightness but he was still not back to one hundred percent. He was offered admission to the hospital for pain control after his emergency room visit but he decided to defer it to an outpatient setting. Was not admitted to the hospital. The patient felt that the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; were medically significant and stated they were disabling, at least temporarily. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; was recovering while unknown for the other events. Patient stated that he felt all of his adverse events were caused by the COVID Vaccination he received.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be excluded based on the temporal relationship. Case will be  reassessed if additional information is received.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. The patient experienced swelling in left arm/thumb and numbness from tip of thumb to joint on opposite limb of administration.  Since Wednesday, 23Dec2020, he has been experiencing some numbness in the arm opposite of where the vaccine was administered. He clarifies the vaccine was administered in the deltoid of his right arm, and the numbness he is experiencing is in his left hand. His thumb has been partially numb since last Wednesday. He got a little bit of tingling in his left arm since last Wednesday (23Dec2020).The patient explains on Tuesday, 22Dec2020, when he was administered the vaccine he only had typical side effects that went away within 24 hours. He experienced headache and muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was administered. Both of these symptoms went away and he has recovered completely. After 24-36 hours, he noticed numbness on hand opposite of the arm where the vaccine was administered. His thumb has been partially numb which has lasted about 6 days. He clarifies the numbness is on the palm side- which he was told was not related to the nerve. His thumb looks swollen and inflamed compared to the other. He also has noticed muscle weakness in the opposite arm. The patient states he can&#39;t recall if the numbness occurred within 24 hours but he knows by 24 hours, he did have the numbness. His thumb is partially numb on the side of the palm and up to the middle of his thumb where the joint is.Patient states yesterday the numbness was noticeably worse when he was sleeping. However, today the numbness seems to be back where it was before. He forgets about the numbness since he is not actively doing anything with that particular hand, but he doesn&#39;t forget about it completely. The numbness hasn&#39;t improved any, it&#39;s been consistently there and never went away. While reading off of his card, the patient cannot determine if the Lot number is an F or an E because the number is underlined. He thinks it might be an E. Patient was able to confirm the Lot number begins with an E after looking at the information sheet he was provided. He also sees the product number, CVX 208. Patient states he has no allergic reactions and nothing that he knows of that is an underlying condition. Patient states he hasn&#39;t had any testing done in regards to these events. He wanted to talk to the manufacturer and report it to the (Contact center name) first before he schedules something at Urgent Care. He wanted to check and see if what he is experiencing is a lesser known symptom. He couldn&#39;t find this information anywhere. The outcome of events, headache and muscle soreness was recovered on 23Dec2020. The outcome of Numbness in hand was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Following the first COVID vaccine dose on Dec/18/2020, I had headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day.  The headaches were usually light, unilateral, and alternating from one side to the other. I was usually functional except on the fourth and seventh days where the headaches were moderate to severe, and I took naps to help with the headaches for those two days. I have never had an issue with headaches before, and these symptoms were a new experience for me. I did not take any medications as treatment for the headaches. Following the second COVID vaccine dose on January/7/2021, I felt fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On January/10/2021, when I woke up that morning I again felt light, unilateral, and alternating headaches. In addition, I noticed that I was unable to move the left side of my face. I felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When I looked in the mirror, I could quite noticeably see asymmetry in my face. I immediately went to the emergency department at the hospital where my primary care doctor is located. I was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation. After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, I was provided with the diagnosis of Bells Palsy. I have never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and I have never previously had a hospital stay before. The doctors prescribed medications which I am currently taking. As of today January/12/2021, the symptoms have had some improvement, but the symptoms still continue.

At about 8:30PM, I started to get chills and started to have muscle soreness all throughout my body (shoulders, arms, back, legs, abdomen, etc.). I went to bed at about 11:30PM with the soreness and chills. I woke up at about 7AM and the chills had resolved. The muscles soreness and now a headache remained up until about 5:30PM on Saturday 1/9/21. After that, I felt right back to normal.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

A 32-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3246) on 07Jan2021 at 09:00 a.m. intramuscular on left deltoid, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included omeprazole. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 at 09:00 on left arm (lot number: EK5730) and experienced headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day. Following the second dose on 07Jan2021, patient experienced fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On 10Jan2021, he noticed that was unable to move the left side of his face. He felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When looked in the mirror, he could quite noticeably see asymmetry in his face. Patient immediately visited emergency department at the hospital where his primary care doctor was located. Patient was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation (as reported). After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, patient was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He had never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and never previously had a hospital stay before. It was also informed that patient underwent Nasal Swab for SARS-CoV-2 test on an unspecified date in Dec2020 and on 10Jan2021, both resulted negative. At the time of the reporting, the symptoms continued.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of diagnosed Bells Palsy presented as unable to move the left side of his face/felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis/asymmetry in his face cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 32-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 06Mar2021 09:45 (lot number: EN6205) at the age of 32 years old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medication included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Initially the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, his diagnosis was changed to rare reaction to a vaccine as per ER report in the hospital. They changed the diagnosis because it was not only his face drooping (reported as drooling) but he did not have a knee reflex or any feeling in his hands, and severe muscle pain all over his body to the extent he can&#39;t move. At the hospital they excluded Lyme disease by blood work and stroke and spinal infection by spinal tapping. Then he was discharged. All events occurred on 12Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. AEs resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab (COVID-19 PCR test): negative on 13Mar2021; and on unspecified date, blood work which excluded Lyme disease and stroke and spinal tapping which excluded spinal infection. Corticosteroid was given as treatment for the events. The patient has not recovered from the events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and an implied temporal association, the reported events are considered possibly related to BNT162B2.

I sat back down for a few more minutes and then I went back to work. The the tingling stopped but my legs felt heavy for 3 days. I am feeling normal now. I am aware of orthostatic hypotension and the possibility of it being from sitting in the chair and pinching nerves. I just wanted to report this in case it is a problem.

I am a pharmacist with a healthcare system and they have been offering the Pfizer/Biontech COVID-19 vaccine for essential associates. I received by first dose of vaccine on 12/31/20. On 1/1/20 I woke up with very noticeable muscle aches and fairly profound lethargy, which last 18-20 hours. I was not able to do much on 1/1/21 because of the way I was feeling. I&#39;m not sure if this reaction is normal for patients who receive their COVID-19 vaccine close to their illness/infection with COVID-19, which is why I&#39;m reporting this to the FDA.

                                                I had the same symptoms on the dose two, as I did in dose 1, same timeline. My arm got heavier and hurt quite a bit. I was feeling feverish by the end of the day, a slight head ache,  clammy, mental fog, exhausted. The following day I had waves of nausea, and each of the previously reported symptoms were stronger. The headache grew stronger and I was relatively useless, feeling very ill. By the next day the 16th most of the symptoms had cleared up. I had a slight headache and felt a bit tired, but much better. By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

                                                While driving home in traffic from getting the vaccine, I felt a tingling over my whole body and then everything started to spin (vertigo). This lasted for about 10 seconds of severe vertigo and then stopped. I thought that was weird and kept driving (was in stop and go traffic) then about 1 minute later it started again and thankfully I was stopped at the time in traffic. I leaned my  seat back slightly and called my wife to tell her where I am. I couldn&#39;t pull over because there was a cement barrier on one side and 4 lanes of traffic on the other. I kept on the phone with her for the remained of my drive and it occurred one more time when I was driving home. Once home, a couple more times I felt it coming on but it didn&#39;t ever happen again. I took my blood pressure and it was normal, boarderline high when I got home (140/84). The next morning I had a fever and severe muscle aches and body aches which lasted most of the day and then today I&#39;ve felt totally fine (today being 1/23).

                                                About an hour after I received my second shot I felt extremely hot and my knees and elbows started to hurt. I felt so hot that I walked outside to my car (about .3 miles away) in freezing cold temperatures with no jacket and didn&#39;t feel the cold at all. I developed a brain fog shortly thereafter and made several mistakes while performing my job throughout the day. My supervisor provided me with extra strength tylenol and within an hour or so the joint pains subsided. By 7 PM that night I had very bad chills and was shaking under a blanket on my couch. My temperature got up to 99.8 which is pretty high for me. I went back and forth between  feeling like I was freezing cold and on fire.  I got very little sleep that night and had disturbing dreams. The following morning all my joints hurt and I felt extreme exhaustion. I laid on my couch all day the day after receiving the shot and felt exhausted and and had no appetite. From 6 PM the day of the shot to 9 PM the following day I ate NOTHING and had no desire to eat. As I&#39;m typing this 60 hours after receiving the second shot the joint pain is  gone, the exhaustion is gone and my appetite is back to normal. There&#39;s a lingering pain at the injection site but otherwise I feel like I did prior to receiving the second shot.

Second shot same as above but starting 24 hours after vaccine I developed left axillary pain. Able to palpate a lymph node ~1cm. Very painful on palpation. Has not limited activity but still painful. Was difficult to fall asleep  2 nights after vaccine. Now day 2 after vaccine still hurts, maybe incrementally better but taking ibuprofen. Cannot palpate significant lymphadenopathy otherwise.  No fever. I am a physician.

Took OTC acetaminophen and NDAIDs. Visited employees health who sent me to urgent care for neurological exam. Urgent care physician noted right arm weaker than left and recorded report of bilateral upper extremity paresthesia. Recommended follow up exam and cervical MRI if symptoms worsen or do not resolve within 7 days. Neck pain has improved but still present. Paresthesias still present. Right arm (dominant arm) still weaker than left. Will follow up with primary care physician this week if symptoms continue.  Additional side effects: headache, dizziness, nausea, shivers, fatigue, joint pain (all resolved within 72 hours).

                                                24 hr after vaccine, I had fatigue and generalized body aches and left arm pain at site of injection. I took tylenol.  Those stopped by the second day morning (day after vaccine). However, in the second morning ( day after vaccine) I started having pain on left side of neck and on Trapezius muscle on left shoulder blade - and had that pain for three more days. Range of motion for neck restricted for three days. All symptoms improved after four days. I took Lidocaine patch and Tylenol for neck and shoulder blade pain.

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

Approximately 10 hours after vaccination i felt very fatigued and tired and went to bed early. Approximately 12 hours after vaccination I woke from sleep with fevers (101.8), chills, and headache. I took tylenol, fever subsided,  and was able to return to sleep at approximately  4:00AM. I woke at 6:30AM with headache, dizziness, and fever (99-100).  I took more tylenol and fever and headache subsided. For remainder of day temperature would start in increase, but stayed below 99, and headache would return between doses of tylenol. I slept through the night of 1/9/2021 and woke 1/10/2021 without fever or headache, although I would experience dizziness with exertion above level of walking.  Today, 1/11/2021, I am not experiencing any symptoms.

Couldn&#39;t abduct arm for about 24 hours due to pain.  Very faint red rash a few inches below injection site that goes across arm.  Arm is moderately itchy and has been since Monday 1/18/21.  Arm feels tight and is still pretty sore when reaching out and stretching it above my head.   No redness, itchiness, or discomfort around injection site.  Everything is in the middle of the upper arm.  The itchiness and prolonged soreness are my concerns, considering I still need a 2nd dose.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Received vax and went home, slept 7 hours, got up and had an extremely strenuous workout including deadlifts (pyramid to heavy weight, 275lb x 5 reps in HIIT sets with kettlebell swings, and boxing in garage gym. Was 45 dF at the time. Patient was finishing workout with last 2 minutes boxing on a 100lb heavy bag and suddenly felt violent &#34;pop&#34; in right medial gastrocnemius muscle. Pt stopped workout and could barely put weight on right leg and reported back to work for shift within 45 minutes of event. Pt iced 4x per day for next 2 days (current), walking better by 2nd day but still very painful and unable to put much weight on forefoot. This has never occurred to patient.

The burning in his back and skin got worse. He took some paracetamol (TYLENOL) in the morning and the headache started to go down. It came back again worse, so he took paracetamol again. He took two tablets of 500mg paracetamol and he tried to go rest on his break. He took a nap on his break for 15 minutes. When he got up from his nap, he found his achiness was much better. The burning was still there. It was getting less but still there. The headache was less when he woke up from the nap. Headache came back worse and he couldn&#39;t open eyes. He took paracetamol.

When I came back around 4pm I was feeling okay, no sore on the injection site, unlike my regularly flu vaccines that I mostly feel sore at injection site which lasts about few hours immediately after the flu shot, so it was sort of surprising to see that but later that night, my body starts feeling weak, aches and a tangling on my feet, as the night progresses up to the early morning, I was unusually fatigued and lightheaded with the regression of the muscle aches and subsequently other symptoms started disappearing, notably, I started feeling soreness on the injection site, which lingered to the next day.

Had first COVID-19 vaccination on 2/13.  Cannot exclude paraneoplastic syndrome; possible hilar mass noted on CXR will need further work-up to rule out sarcoid/malignancy.

                                                1/8 vaccination Almost 72 hours later, fatigue, itching in a few spots, I saw hives/welts on couple different areas on upper arms, upper thighs. Very big and itchy. I took some Claritin. Those welts continued to grow and spread;  Upper inner arms, flanks, inner thighs.  Continued throughout the night  *took pictures of welts Took some Benadryl at night. Woke up; symptoms still there and extended even more to include hands. I went to work. I wasn&#39;t feeling ill but uncomfortable. Took some more antihistamines. It got worse thru the day. No SOB.  1/12 noon Different kind of rash, petechia in appearance.; shins. My knees, ankles, feet were starting to swell.  Hives had gone from the thighs and up, But below, shins to feet, were swelling.  1/13 I woke up to a lacy rash over all extremities. Bruising on shins. Knees, hands and feet still swollen.  Started Oral steroid. By noon that day, pretty much everything had cleared up. Six day course treatment, no symptoms came back. No fever. No SOB. I did miss work the 1/13 as it was at its worse.

                                                I experienced the normal moderate soreness after both injections as well as the expected mild flu like symptoms for about a day after the second injection.  The primary reason i am reporting an adverse effect is that I am still experiencing mild soreness in the shoulder muscle into which the vaccine was injected.  Occasionally, this soreness seems to be present in the other muscles of my upper arm as well.  This mild soreness has persisted and been very consistent ever since the initial moderate soreness from the first injection subsided about 2 months ago.  I have not experienced this type of lingering soreness following any previous vaccination.

I was prescribed acyclovir and indomethicin. The rash has mostly cleared, but pain in both my torso and foot still persists.

This 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899), intramuscular in left arm (IM in left shoulder) on 22Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. None medical history nor concomitant medications. Three hours after the vaccine (on 22Dec2020) patient started developing nausea that was pretty much and it was enough that patient had to stay at home instead of going out to shoot golf balls, it was so significant nausea. Then he had some extreme fatigue, muscle ache/muscle pain, started developing cough, sore throat and headache. Then all of his joints were painful. Patient had a mild discomfort the day after at the injection site. The next day (on 23Dec2020) when he woke up nausea was gone. Patient might just have some general labs at the family practitioner just to check cholesterol. The outcome of &#34;nausea&#34; was recovered on 23Dec2020, of &#34;mild discomfort at the injection site&#34; was unknown, outcome of else events was not recovered. The reporting physician considered all events &#34;related&#34; to the Covid 19 Vaccine, Physician stated 100 percent it is from the vaccine.

                                                A few hours after injection, I began having discomfort in my left shoulder, the location of the injection.  Over the following next few hours I began to have overall body aches and pains in my joints.  My skin became extremely sensitive to the touch, a very strange hard to describe sensation.  I then began to get the chills, and running a fever.  Ultimately my fever spiked at 104 degrees.   I took a cold bath to bring the fever down, and for the rest of the night seesawed back and forth with fever using cold compresses and no sheets on my bed to keep my fever down.  I also took one 200 Mg Ib-Profen.  At roughly 26 hours after the injection, I no longer have a fever, but the body aches persist.

A 39-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686) intramuscularly in the right arm on 11Jan2021 at 8:30 (at the age of 39-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history included hypertension and migraines. The patient does not have allergies to medication, food, or other products. Historical vaccinations included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Lot number EK5730) in the right arm on 18Dec2020. Prior to vaccination, the patient had not been diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was administered the vaccine in a Hospital. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Beginning on 14Jan2021 the patient started to experience dysaesthesia in the right arm (upper arm on the posterior aspect and forearm) and right hip/thigh. Discomfort feels like pins/needles sensation anytime skin is touched lightly (such as blankets, clothing etc). As of the reporting date, the symptoms persist. In addition, the right shoulder, right elbow, and right hip joints are mildly sore which also are persistent. No perceived muscle weakness and no associated numbness. Treatment was not received for the events. Lab data included two post vaccination COVID 19 tests. A PCR nasal swab test on 11Jan2021 and a PCR nasal swab test on 17Jan2021 both of which were negative for COVID-19. The clinical outcomes of dysaesthesia, joint soreness and pins and needles were reported as not recovered.

One week later, I developed severe hives, and itching all over my body and it didn&#39;t stop until about 24 hours later. I went to urgent care. They put me on Prednisone.

                                                Around 5:30am I woke up feeling as though I had not slept well. I had chills, then I would sweat, then I would have chills again. I had severe fatigue, and muscle aches centering in my lower back. I took my temperature and it was 100 degrees. I took Aleve and laid back down. My fever subsided, but I continued to intermittently feel chills throughout the day. I took a warm bath and shower. I felt exhausted and the ache in my back continued. I laid back down from 5-11pm and continued to feel chills, though not as severe as they had been. In the evening, beginning around 7, when I would get up I felt a chill and a wave of paranoia, affecting my mental stability. These would subside when I laid back down. I retired to bed at 11 and woke up at 5am completely drenched in sweat. I changed clothes and returned to bed. When I woke up at 7:30am for work, I felt much better and have felt fairly normal, except for being dehydrated, since.
