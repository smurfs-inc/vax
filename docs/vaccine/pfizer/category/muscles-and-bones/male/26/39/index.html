                                                Myalgias starting within 1 hour after vaccination, worsened throughout day that radiated to ipsilateral trapezius and rhomboid areas.  Starting around 16 hours after vaccination, severe subjective fevers and chills with severe headache that worsened with lying down. The headache was the most concerning symptom with tinnitus when laying flat in supine. It awoke me from sleep and prevented me from laying flat so I had to sleep upright on the couch. I took tylenol 500mg around 0200 and was able to sleep for a few hours. By 24 hours post vaccine, the headache and fevers/chills significantly improved so I could attend work the next day.

                                                Chills; flu like symptoms; Nausea; Myalgia; Headache; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 26-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EK9231; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 20:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. He received his first dose (age of vaccination was 26-year-old) of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EH9899; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s family history included his father has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine in a university hospital which set up a clinic. The patient reported that he thought he got his second dose last night at about 8 pm and since then in the morning around 8 am, so about 12 hours after he started having flu like symptoms that got pretty bad one point. He took some acetaminophen (TYLENOL) so it has gotten better but he was having myalgia, headache, fever, chills and nausea. The patient further mentioned that first, he started having chills around 8 am in the morning. He had chills before but now he kind of overheated and now he is not under a blanket anymore, so he thinks that is improved. He then started having nausea, then myalgia and then everything kind of got bad all at once. He mentioned that over all everything has improved except the headache. He further added that everything has not gone away complete but improved significantly. Earlier today (14Jan2021) like 2-3 hours ago he would say it was a 7 or 8 on a scale of 0-10 but right now it is about 4 on a scale of 0-10 and that goes for everything. He does not think anything else is confounding, he is not on any medications and has no chronic health problems, there has been no labs drawn. The patient did not visit an emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the outcome of the event headache was unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovering.

                                                I had a blood report taken on the 25th of February as a part of my physical. I have never had elevated platelets, but this report showed my platelets at at 499 (130-450 is reference ranges of the lab). A year ago, my platelets were just below the max at 445. Upon discussing with my PA, he didn&#39;t feel too concerned, but after asking if the first dose covid shot may have something to do with it, that became a potential etiology.  I am very unsure of my elevated platelets is associated with the first dose. Arm was stiff on injection date for approximately 6 hours. Felt slightly flu like symptoms (headache, dizziness, fatigue) that same evening of injection date and felt fine the next morning.  Blood specimen was taken on 25th of February 2021. Diet at the time is a ketogeneic diet. I&#39;d like to make it clear I mean no deception and am unsure if there is an association with the vaccine and platelet levels, but my elevated platelets is inconsistent with any other blood report in the past, and the dose 1 covid vaccine was the only &#34;new&#34; thing in my life prior to the blood draw. I figured, better to let y&#39;all know in case it became relevant. Currently on no treatments for the platelets and was told to &#34;not worry about it&#34; which is hard for me to just take.

This rash appeared within a week or so of getting the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Over the next few weeks the rash slowly faded (not completely, though). When I woke up the morning after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, the rash doubled in coverage in the same areas of my body.   Around the time the rash showed up, I also began experiencing lower to mid-back pain, which grew more severe over time. The back pain is worst in the morning after sleeping, or after sitting/resting for longer periods of time. I&#39;ve been taking Ibuprofen and Aleve, which helps, as does being active. The back pain did not noticeably worsen after the second dose, but it is just as severe.   Currently, the rash has faded (not completely), and my back pain is still quite bothersome.

                                                On 2/13/2021, I began to experience both enhanced and new musculoskeletal and neurological symptoms that have not completely resolved still, today, 3/16/2021. While I had experienced some slight discomfort and pain of the b/l thumbs 2-3 weeks prior to 2/13, I began to experience increased pain up to the forearm in both arms on that day. In addition to pain, I had large muscular knots in the superior forearms, especially the right arm. The lower right arm felt extremely tight, and I was having difficulty raising the arm and gripping things. This continued for 2-3 weeks on the right arm. During that time, symptoms worsened on the left arm, while improving on the right arm. A week after the initial symptoms my left arm became worse, and I was struggling to lift objects as light as a sheet of paper. I was also having trouble typing at work, dialing the phone, and opening or closing my hand. Just over a week after symptoms began, I left work to determine a cause and solution for my issues. I also began to have tremors, extreme muscle spasms, and involuntary movements around this time for about 2-3 weeks. While the neurological symptoms have mostly subsided, still, today, 3/16/2021, I continue to deal with various inflammatory musculoskeletal symptoms affecting mostly my left arm, but also my right arm. Since yesterday, my left shoulder has begun to have pain as well, making raising my arm and reaching to the opposite side difficult due to pain. I have also had persistent popping of various joints in both arms since the initial symptoms began.

                                                This was my second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. I took some notes during my waiting time following my injection similar to my first dose. Information from my last report can be found using Temporary VAERS E-Report No: 334845. Of note, I did prepare for my second dose by taking Benadryl 50 mg and Airborne Immune-Boost supplements the night before my second dose, so my symptoms were not as severe as last time.  6 minutes: Mild tingling around tongue. This time all around the edges of my tongue, but a lot less bothersome than the first dose. 8 minutes: Weird. Slight itchiness under left half of tongue. Still very mild but less concerning than first dose itchiness on the left and right sides of my tongue. 18 minutes: Itchy on right side slightly, only side noticeable. 20 minutes: Mild warm feeling on left side of top of my throat. Less bothersome than time. 26 minutes: Left throat warm ness resolved, but transitioned to right side of top of my throat. 31 minute: Throat warmness overall resolved, but slightly itchy on edge of right side of my tongue. 37 minutes: Top of throat on right feels weird but not itchy. Warm maybe? 39 minutes: Weird feeling on right side of throat resolved.  Symptoms more or less resolved the rest of the day, especially after second dose of Flonase @ 9:00 am.  14 hours later: About to go to bed. Feeling fatigued, similar to my first dose after working out. Took airborne and two Benadryl (25 mg each) before sleeping.  24 hours later: 03/27/2021, feeling more fatigued, groggy, mild headache (mostly at back of my head), and muscle aches around my body.  25 hours later: Groggy feeling and fatigue resolved. Possibly due to Benadryl or vaccine?  32 hours later: Majority of muscle aches resolved. Headache also resolved. Feeling mostly soreness at this point.  Drank Airborne @ 10:00 am and 4:00 pm. In between drank plenty of fluids (water, cranberry juice, apple juice, milk). No fever or chills.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly in unknown arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for routine mass immunizations (covid-19 immunization). The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Not a military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none and concomitant medications was none (he was on no other medications). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced tachycardia, intermittent palpitations, low grade fever/fever all started somewhere in the morning of 18Dec2020 and muscle aches on 17Dec2020. Physician assessed tachycardia and intermittent palpitations as serious due to medically significant. Physician stated that one of his workers had the vaccine and proceeded to have tachycardia and low grade fever. He would like to know if patient should get the second dose. The patient had mostly tachycardia with some intermittent palpitations. Patient was seen in his office on 18Dec2020, and got the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020. He also reported fever and muscle aches, although the fever was subjective and was not documented. Tachycardia improved and sent him to cardiology on 21Dec2020. It was not life threatening and they did an Electrocardiogram (EKG). His initial heart rate was 130. When he was seen again in their office on 21Dec2020, it was 93, which was baseline. It improved. He never got his temperature. The highest in office was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He had some muscle aches. The physician just sent patient to cardiology because he was having intermittent tachycardia and intermittent palpitations. Two visits to physician office. He was seen on 18Dec2020 and again on 21Dec2020. Relevant tests: they did testing for tachycardia but not related specifically. They did thyroid and EKG in office and he did not know if test were back. EKG was ok. The Thyroid, Complete blood count (CBC) and lipid (all were on an unknown date in Dec2020) were not back and were just done to make sure there were no cardiac issues. The outcome of the events was recovering. The lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events tachycardia and palpitations cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I would like to start out by saying that I am well aware that this vaccine is known to cause side effects and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any side effects induced by it. The reason I am writing this is to provide information that you all can keep in mind as you provide guidance on your recommendations for the timing of when the vaccine should be administered to those who have already tested positive for COVID. I tested positive for COVID-19 11 days prior to getting vaccinated. My symptoms from the virus began on 12/21/20, lasted until 12/26/20 and included: mild headache, fever of 100.3, moderate muscle fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and sinus congestion. I received the Pfizer vaccine on 1/3/21 at 11am and by 2am on 1/4/21 I was experiencing a temperature of 102.5, severe headache, severe muscle fatigue, and painful right axillary lymphadenopathy. Although they had almost completely resolved by 11am on 1/4/20, I would describe these side effects to the vaccine as significantly worse than the symptoms of the virus itself. As someone who has a stronger medical background than the general public (I am a 4th year dental student in a patient-facing role and was encouraged by my school to receive the vaccine despite already testing positive), I understood the likelihood of developing side effects to the vaccine and I am still planning on receiving my second dose in three weeks despite already showing clear signs of a strong immune response to the proteins created by the vaccine. The reason why I am writing this is because there was no guidance on recommending that I wait longer than 10 days between testing positive and receiving the vaccine and I am worried that if the general public is allowed to receive the vaccine at this same time interval, there will be a significant number of people who will have similar side effects (worse than those induced by the virus itself) and they will not only refuse a second dose, but could also vocally discourage many people from trusting the vaccine?s safety and benefit. I obviously don?t know what minimum timeframe should be recommended, but from my individual experience, 11 days was not sufficient. I will be happy to follow up if you would like to know how the symptoms fare after my second dose.

A 27-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 04Jan2021 11:15 AM (at the age of 27-years) as a single dose (Lot Number EK9231) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and no allergies to medications, food or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 12:00 PM (at the age of 27-years) as a single dose (Lot Number EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had not received any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 04Jan2021, approximately 10-12 hours after 2nd dose of vaccine the patient began to feel really cold, had some mild muscle pains, joint pains, and a headache. Overnight these symptoms worsened to severe muscle pains, joint pains, and a throbbing headache, shivering chills, took a temperature and had a fever of 101.7F. These symptoms did not subside until late the next morning. The headache had persisted. The patient reported taking paracetamol (TYLENOL) 1000 mg, which helped. The outcome of the events feels really cold, muscle pains, joint pains, throbbing headache, shivering chills, fever of 101.7F, were reported as recovering.

                                                Received the first COVID shot on 1-17-21 and began to feel pain in the back of my neck on the right side in the afternoon of 1-19-21. On 1-20-21 I lost part of my taste and neck started to cause headaches. On 1-21-21 symptoms continued to get worse. On 1-22-21 I began to lose control of the right side of my face. Face began to droop and eye was unable to close. I went to the ER on the evening of 1-22-21 and was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package. I did experience very bad side affects:  headaches, muscle pains, tiredness, fatigue, weakness, low strength, dizziness, partial blindness, overwhelming stress, back pain, joint pain,  spinal pain, chills, fever like symptoms, nausea, spontaneous  pain, soreness in the arm, swelling throughout my body, difficulty breathing, short breaths.

                                                Similar symptoms to pericarditis, with debilitating pain that was exasperated while lying down; Heart palpitations; left armpit with pain radiating to entire left shoulder through the middle of the neck; low grade fever; severe fatigue; slightly dry cough; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for himself. A 27-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EV8732/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 07Apr2021 at 13:45 (at the age of 27 years old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included COVID-19 on an unspecified date. The patient did not have any known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication (other medications taken in two weeks) were none.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 19Apr2021 at 22:00, the patient experienced similar symptoms to pericarditis, with debilitating pain that was exasperated while lying down, Heart palpitations, left armpit with pain radiating to entire left shoulder through the middle of the neck, low grade fever, severe fatigue and slightly dry cough. The events required a physician&#39;s office visit. The patient received treatment for these events. The clinical course of the events was as follows: Heart palpitations originating under left armpit with pain radiating to entire left shoulder through the middle of the neck. Similar symptoms to pericarditis, with debilitating pain that was exasperated while lying down, low grade fever, severe fatigue, and slightly dry cough. Lasted about 30 hours. Discomfort relief, like pericarditis, was only felt when sitting up and propping myself up by my arms leaning forward. Onset was rapid, occurring 13 days after the first dose of the vaccine over a period of 8 hours (palpitations came first, followed by shoulder and neck pain in the morning). Treated with Aspirin at first (low effectiveness) followed by NSAID Advil 7 hours later (high effectiveness, symptom relief was about 50%). High strength Advil recommended by MD. The outcome of the events was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

On the morning of 1/8 I woke up with noted chills and headache.  I checked my temp and noticed 100.4* oral temp.  I also had back pain, muscle pain, headaches, continued fever (improved with motrin) and chills. My left arm from my shoulder to my wrist was with noted pain/aches, improved with motrin. On the morning of 1/9 I felt much better, did not take any motrin/tylenol and without any fever/chills.  Noted improvement of muscle aches in general and arm felt  the same as 1/7 (much better!).  Noted lymph swelling of my axillary lymph nodes with aching pain.  This has not gone away at current but improved with x1 dose of motrin.

                                                Symptoms of 2nd Covid vaccine lot EL 1284: numbness in feet, legs throbbing, muscle weakness in legs, overall tiredness  I received my second Pfizer vaccine on 1/12/21 at 12:15 pm.  After several hours, I felt weak and tired.  By 7:00 pm, I had a migraine that wouldn?t go away and I had muscle ache in my feet and legs.  On 1/13/21 I felt some numbness in my feet and my legs were throbbing.  By 10:00 pm, both of my feet were completely numb and my legs were throbbing/radiating heat.  It felt as if circulation was cut off from my feet entirely.  On 1/14/21 I went into work where I?m constantly on my feet.  I felt intense muscle weakness in my legs and thighs to point where I could barely stand up.  I immediately went to an urgent care where they started me on an Sodium Chloride 0.9% intravenous IV solution drip.  They ran blood tests and urine tests to rule out any other causes to my symptoms.  All results came back negative.  I was told to rest, hydrate, and recover for the next several days.  If my symptoms did not subside within the next couple days, I was instructed to go to the ER for further examination.

He was taking ibuprofen for prophylactic symptom relief and was able to attend work the following day.  The patient stated to still endorses symptoms of the vaccine days after but did not seek medical attention because he thought the symptoms would resolve.  The morning of 1/21, patient sustained constant, nonradiating chest pain located along the sternal that was  moderate to severe in nature and exacerbated with deep inspiration that lasted 2 hours.  Lying on the side provided minimal relief but the pain was still moderate.  Nausea also accompanied the pain but the patient denied any vomiting.  Patient decided to go to the ED for work-up.   Patient had two further episodes of chest pain and EKG revealed diffuse ST elevations. Troponin level peaked at 3.02. He was diagnosed with myopericarditis and started on colchicine, with improvement of chest pain.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Cervical and clavicular lymphadenopathy on the left side; Some tenderness in neck; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 29-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 17Dec2020 at 11:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the hospital. On 27Dec2020, the patient experienced cervical and clavicular lymphadenopathy on the left side (same side as the vaccine shot was received). The patient first noticed some tenderness in neck about 10 days after vaccine was administered. The events were considered non-serious. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient had not recovered from the events.   Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

A 29-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EK4176) in the hospital, via intramuscular route on 10Feb2021 at 10:30 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from 2010 to 2011 and allergies to penicillin on an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to vaccination, was the patient not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: H9899) in the hospital, via intramuscular route at 01:15 PM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that on 12Feb2021 at 08:00 PM (also reported as &#39;3 days after injection&#39;) the patient experienced flu-like symptoms that included fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, and a persistent headache. On 13Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 4th day&#39;, the patient developed pleurisy and difficulty breathing and had 2 syncope events the morning of 14Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 5th day&#39;). The patient was taken by ambulance and admitted to ER for further testing. It was determined that all symptoms likely related to the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine recently received. Pleurisy persists one week following vaccine dose. The patient went to the emergency room/department or urgent care due to the events. As treatment for the event, the patient was monitored and given IV fluids over 12 hour stay in CDU. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae (reported as recovered with lasting effects). The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Uncertain if truly caused by the vaccine.  I had an ACL reconstruction done back in May of 2020.  My knee has transient swelling that comes and goes, but is not particularly frequent.  3 days after receiving the vaccine, my knee swelled up and remained swollen for about 7 days.  It has since gone back down.  I did not have any acute injuries or remarkable events happen during this time other than the vaccine administration.  Overall, uncertain if it was caused by vaccine, but it was odd enough to report.

                                                20 hours after injection, I started having progressively worsening severe back pain, neck pain, headache, chills (no fever), skin sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, and brain fog. 2 days after the vaccine, I had abdominal pain, and cough. All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

                                                In the evening after getting the shot, I started getting chills and became more sensitive to cold temperatures.  Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

A 30-year-old male patient received second dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization (reported as &#34;I guess to protect myself from other people, to protect myself&#34;). There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient took his first dose on 20Dec2020, 3 weeks from there, he took the second on 10Jan2021 (reported as &#34;it was 10th it was Sunday morning when I took it&#34;). The patient reported that he had his second dose on Sunday morning (10Jan2021) and started feeling tired last Monday (11Jan2021). Then on 12Jan2021 (reported as &#34;yesterday&#34; at the time of reporting), he started to feel his chest and neck hurting. The patient stated that he woke up in the middle of the night (Sunday night) and Monday morning, he was feeling really sick so he called out rest all day on Monday (11Jan2021). Then patient woke up yesterday morning (12Jan2021) feeling good then probably about 6 o&#39;clock last night he started feeling tired, like real bad tired and he got home. Patient lied down and woke up in middle of night, his chest, arms and head were hurting. His neck and all around head area were hurting real bad. The events were assessed as non-serious. The patient does not have the lot number but stated that it was the Pfizer vaccine. When the patient was asked if still experiencing tiredness and chest hurting, he stated &#34;When I started, that was last night on I will go with the 12 before midnight 12 (not clear). Yes right now yeah. This is the first time my chest and my arms and my neck and like all that has been hurting, started last night&#34;. When asked for the treatment, the patient answered &#34;I took Ibuprofen to calm it down a little bit. I took Ibuprofen if you count that as a treatment&#34;. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Shoulder soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 30-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EK4176; Expiration date was not reported) on 07Jan2021 at a single dose on the right arm, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the workplace clinic. The patient had no relevant medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EH9899; Expiration date was not reported), intramuscularly on the left arm on 16Dec2020 (when the patient was 30 years old) for COVID-19 immunization. On 07Jan2021, the patient had shoulder soreness. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. The outcome of the event, shoulder soreness, was recovered on 09Jan2021. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested since the vaccination.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Also felt unusually anxious, though unsure if that was directly due to the vaccine or to the inability to sleep for a number of days because of the feverish chills. Acute symptoms lasted for 48 hours, and prohibited me from being able to work from home.   I still have what feels like a lingering sinus headache (with no actual sinus symptoms) as well as some fatigue. Lingering headache is not debilitating, but it is irritating. Feels a bit like a sensation of pressure in my forehead.

                                                11pm on day of (Sunday) vaccination felt soreness in left arm at injection site and in entire upper arm when trying to hold it up. Soreness subsided by noon the next day, Monday. No symptoms on Tuesday until late evening when tongue began to feel sore. On Wednesday morning around 6am, woke up with severe body fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, nausea, headache. Hands and fingers very cold to the touch. Severe fatigue and weakness all day. Sore tongue persisted. No respiratory symptoms present. By Thursday (today), body is still feverish, joint and muscle aches persist, light headache at times. Still fatigued and weak. All symptoms today Thursday are much weaker except for the muscle and joint pain which remains high.  The reason I am reporting this is that from what I&#39;ve read and been told, the delayed onset of these symptoms (almost 3 days) is very unusual, especially because I had little/no symptoms in the first 2 days of the vaccine.

A 30-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot Not Provided, second dose) solution for injection intramuscular on an unknown date (at the age of 30-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Cystic Fibrosis and Autoimmune Necrotizing Myositis. Concomitant medications were unknown. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (first dose) for COVID-19 vaccination on an unknown date with no adverse effect reported (tolerated first COVID-19 vaccine). The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Less than 24 hours after second COVID-19 vaccine injection, the patient had severe polymyalgia. CPKs checked very high at 80,000. The patient was currently admitted to the hospital. Unspecified treatment was provided for the events severe polymyalgias and CPKs very high. The outcome of the events severe polymyalgias and CPKs very high was unknown. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was supposed to get RITUXAN as a regimen for his muscle disorder and was interested in Pfizer checking his neutralizing antibody level both pre and post Rituxan. The patient will receive RITUXAN shortly in the next week.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine causality between events severe polymyalgia and CPKs checked very high and  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE0 cannot be excluded.

A 30-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: el1283), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, on 09Jan2021 11:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mild asthma, allergies to fur, mites and olive tree pollen from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) in two weeks included finasteride taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: ek5730) at 30-year-old on 19Dec2020 08:00 PM at left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination. No Covid tested post vaccination. A few hours after the second dose, the patient experienced back and joint pain, shivers and headaches for two days. On 19Jan2021 (reported as 10 days after the second dose), the patient started experiencing tingling sensation (paresthesia) in both legs without loss of sensitivity or strength. Also, the patient started having lumbar pain similar to a mild muscle cramp. The paresthesia was somewhat strong for a week and started to very slowly fade away, but the patient still has intermittent lumbar discomfort and mild tingling sensation in his feet and sometimes legs depending on posture. Possibly a demyelinating neuropathy. No treatment AE. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A 30-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: ER8730) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 31Mar2021 15:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroid. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium taken for hypothyroid. The patient previously received tetanus vaccine (6 weeks out from his Covid Vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient stated that his side effects began on 01Apr2021. He noticed tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck. This was the same side of the body he got the vaccine on. His symptoms worsened over the next two days. He had increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck. On Saturday 03Apr2021. it took him a half an hour just to get out of bed. Stated that he went to the Emergency Room at the hospital where he works and they did a series of tests. He had CAT Scans with and without contrast, a MRI, and an Ultrasound. Mentioned later that they also did blood work (Apr2021). The Emergency Room doctor told the caller he was going to have his CAT scan read by a specialist. Caller stated they called him on Sunday 04Apr2021 and said his CAT scan showed an inflammatory infectious process with atypical organisms and Lymphadenopathy. He stated that he read that Lymphadenopathy was a side effect of the vaccine. They told him that the Lymphadenopathy was compressing the nerves in his neck and causing his pain and decreased range of motion. He had been on a week of treatment consisting of pain medications, muscle relaxers, and anti-inflammatory medications. The Infectious Disease was consulted and he was started on a 5 day course of Azithromycin. He was on the third day of this antibiotic per his report. He has a follow up MRI scheduled next Friday. He was calling to report his side effects and also to ask about what he should do in regards to his appointment for his second dose of the vaccination. His symptoms were worsening for the first three days. Since he has been being treated for them they have started to improve slowly day by day. Today he said there was minimal pain and tightness but he was still not back to one hundred percent. He was offered admission to the hospital for pain control after his emergency room visit but he decided to defer it to an outpatient setting. Was not admitted to the hospital. The patient felt that the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; were medically significant and stated they were disabling, at least temporarily. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; was recovering while unknown for the other events. Patient stated that he felt all of his adverse events were caused by the COVID Vaccination he received.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be excluded based on the temporal relationship.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

                                                On 2/7 I woke up with pain in left shoulder. Movement away from body caused intense tearing pain in shoulder and bicep muscle. After 4 days intense pain had subsided. I am still experiencing persistent aching in shoulder upon movement away from body and noticed marked weakness in arm upon exercise.

                                                Sore arm at injection site began hours after (nothing terrible). Woke up the next day with mild to severe body aches, muscle soreness, joint pain and pain in my stomach/abdomen. Developed a 101 fever 24 hrs after receiving the vaccine, and continued until this morning (3/16). Vomiting multiple times in the middle of the night on 3/14. The vomiting was only a one night deal, but every other symptom that I experienced has been persistent until this morning. I feel about 80% back at the moment. Symptoms were very similar, maybe even a little more extreme, than the ones I experienced when I contracted Covid months ago, but they didn?t last as long.

A 31-year-old male patient received of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Pfizer, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number and Expiration date were not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 (age at vaccination 31 years) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Reportedly, there were no known allergies to medications, food or other products other medical history. Patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. Patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient was complaining of right facial weakness since 04Apr2021 (the day before yesterday), drooping face, has difficulty closing right eye. It was associated with headache, neck pain. The neck and headache pain scale was 7/10 for 4-5 days. It was reported that pain comes and goes. The headache was less when he works and exercise. But the headache was more severe at night. It was hard to get into sleep last night. There was no n/v/c/d, blurred vision, cp, sob, doe, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, etc. There was no rash, numbness. The adverse event resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The reporter assessed the case as non-serious with no seriousness criteria (Seriousness criteria-Results in death/ Seriousness criteria-Life threatening/ Seriousness criteria-Caused/prolonged hospitalization/ Seriousness criteria-Disabling/Incapacitating/ Seriousness criteria-Congenital anomaly/birth defect). No treatment was given for adverse events. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of drooping face cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. The patient experienced swelling in left arm/thumb and numbness from tip of thumb to joint on opposite limb of administration.  Since Wednesday, 23Dec2020, he has been experiencing some numbness in the arm opposite of where the vaccine was administered. He clarifies the vaccine was administered in the deltoid of his right arm, and the numbness he is experiencing is in his left hand. His thumb has been partially numb since last Wednesday. He got a little bit of tingling in his left arm since last Wednesday (23Dec2020).The patient explains on Tuesday, 22Dec2020, when he was administered the vaccine he only had typical side effects that went away within 24 hours. He experienced headache and muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was administered. Both of these symptoms went away and he has recovered completely. After 24-36 hours, he noticed numbness on hand opposite of the arm where the vaccine was administered. His thumb has been partially numb which has lasted about 6 days. He clarifies the numbness is on the palm side- which he was told was not related to the nerve. His thumb looks swollen and inflamed compared to the other. He also has noticed muscle weakness in the opposite arm. The patient states he can&#39;t recall if the numbness occurred within 24 hours but he knows by 24 hours, he did have the numbness. His thumb is partially numb on the side of the palm and up to the middle of his thumb where the joint is.Patient states yesterday the numbness was noticeably worse when he was sleeping. However, today the numbness seems to be back where it was before. He forgets about the numbness since he is not actively doing anything with that particular hand, but he doesn&#39;t forget about it completely. The numbness hasn&#39;t improved any, it&#39;s been consistently there and never went away. While reading off of his card, the patient cannot determine if the Lot number is an F or an E because the number is underlined. He thinks it might be an E. Patient was able to confirm the Lot number begins with an E after looking at the information sheet he was provided. He also sees the product number, CVX 208. Patient states he has no allergic reactions and nothing that he knows of that is an underlying condition. Patient states he hasn&#39;t had any testing done in regards to these events. He wanted to talk to the manufacturer and report it to the (Contact center name) first before he schedules something at Urgent Care. He wanted to check and see if what he is experiencing is a lesser known symptom. He couldn&#39;t find this information anywhere. The outcome of events, headache and muscle soreness was recovered on 23Dec2020. The outcome of Numbness in hand was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Following the first COVID vaccine dose on Dec/18/2020, I had headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day.  The headaches were usually light, unilateral, and alternating from one side to the other. I was usually functional except on the fourth and seventh days where the headaches were moderate to severe, and I took naps to help with the headaches for those two days. I have never had an issue with headaches before, and these symptoms were a new experience for me. I did not take any medications as treatment for the headaches. Following the second COVID vaccine dose on January/7/2021, I felt fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On January/10/2021, when I woke up that morning I again felt light, unilateral, and alternating headaches. In addition, I noticed that I was unable to move the left side of my face. I felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When I looked in the mirror, I could quite noticeably see asymmetry in my face. I immediately went to the emergency department at the hospital where my primary care doctor is located. I was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation. After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, I was provided with the diagnosis of Bells Palsy. I have never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and I have never previously had a hospital stay before. The doctors prescribed medications which I am currently taking. As of today January/12/2021, the symptoms have had some improvement, but the symptoms still continue.

At about 8:30PM, I started to get chills and started to have muscle soreness all throughout my body (shoulders, arms, back, legs, abdomen, etc.). I went to bed at about 11:30PM with the soreness and chills. I woke up at about 7AM and the chills had resolved. The muscles soreness and now a headache remained up until about 5:30PM on Saturday 1/9/21. After that, I felt right back to normal.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

A 32-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3246) on 07Jan2021 at 09:00 a.m. intramuscular on left deltoid, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included omeprazole. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 at 09:00 on left arm (lot number: EK5730) and experienced headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day. Following the second dose on 07Jan2021, patient experienced fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On 10Jan2021, he noticed that was unable to move the left side of his face. He felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When looked in the mirror, he could quite noticeably see asymmetry in his face. Patient immediately visited emergency department at the hospital where his primary care doctor was located. Patient was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation (as reported). After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, patient was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He had never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and never previously had a hospital stay before. It was also informed that patient underwent Nasal Swab for SARS-CoV-2 test on an unspecified date in Dec2020 and on 10Jan2021, both resulted negative. At the time of the reporting, the symptoms continued.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of diagnosed Bells Palsy presented as unable to move the left side of his face/felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis/asymmetry in his face cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About two weeks after first shot, I got shingles. It could be unrelated, but since I&#39;m young, perfectly healthy, not abnormally stressed, and haven&#39;t ever had singles before, I thought there might be a chance it is related. I&#39;ve seen online other young people who are saying that they got shingles after the first shot of Moderna or Pfizer.  Maybe it was just a coincidence, but I figured it was worth reporting. It is overall a pretty mild case because I got on the antiviral drugs pretty quickly. Wondering if I should still get my second shot on schedule or wait until my shingles is all cleared. I have asked my doctor and am awaiting a response. I first noticed the symptoms on Saturday (3/20) exactly two weeks after my first shot.

                                                On April 6 a.m. developed fewer-like symptoms with muscle pain typical foe fewer with these symptoms steadily worsening by evening. Night shower at appr. 9 p.m. caused a feeling of spinal nerve pinch followed by acute pain during certain movements and breathing. Following day (Wednesday) spent in bed taking Ibuprophene thinking is just a nerve pinch. Called virtual appointment tele doctor who prescribed Katorolac which I took from Wednesday night to Thursday morning per prescription with no effects. On Thursday evening called tele doctor again and got Ibuprophene 800 mg prescription. It helped for 20-30 min only. Same evening coughed some blood. On Friday kept taking Ibuprophene for very temporary relieve. On Saturday April 10 was admitted to hospital and was hospitalized with blood cloth diagnosis for 4 days.

A 32-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 06Mar2021 09:45 (lot number: EN6205) at the age of 32 years old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medication included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Initially the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, his diagnosis was changed to rare reaction to a vaccine as per ER report in the hospital. They changed the diagnosis because it was not only his face drooping (reported as drooling) but he did not have a knee reflex or any feeling in his hands, and severe muscle pain all over his body to the extent he can&#39;t move. At the hospital they excluded Lyme disease by blood work and stroke and spinal infection by spinal tapping. Then he was discharged. All events occurred on 12Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. AEs resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab (COVID-19 PCR test): negative on 13Mar2021; and on unspecified date, blood work which excluded Lyme disease and stroke and spinal tapping which excluded spinal infection. Corticosteroid was given as treatment for the events. The patient has not recovered from the events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and an implied temporal association, the reported events are considered possibly related to BNT162B2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I sat back down for a few more minutes and then I went back to work. The the tingling stopped but my legs felt heavy for 3 days. I am feeling normal now.

A 33-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot numbers and expiry dates were unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Dec2020 for the first dose and on 08Jan2021 for the second dose, both administered in the right arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2 and did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 09Jan2021, the patient experienced nausea, shortness of breath, tiredness, and stiffness at the injection site. No therapeutic measures were taken in response to the events. Outcome of the events at the time of last observation was recovered. The report was considered as non-serious; the events did not result in death, were not life threatening, did not caused/prolonged hospitalization, were not disabling/ incapacitating, and did not caused any congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I am a pharmacist with a healthcare system and they have been offering the Pfizer/Biontech COVID-19 vaccine for essential associates. I received by first dose of vaccine on 12/31/20. On 1/1/20 I woke up with very noticeable muscle aches and fairly profound lethargy, which last 18-20 hours. I was not able to do much on 1/1/21 because of the way I was feeling. I&#39;m not sure if this reaction is normal for patients who receive their COVID-19 vaccine close to their illness/infection with COVID-19, which is why I&#39;m reporting this to the FDA.

I was feeling feverish by the end of the day, a slight head ache,  clammy, mental fog, exhausted. The following day I had waves of nausea, and each of the previously reported symptoms were stronger. The headache grew stronger and I was relatively useless, feeling very ill. By the next day the 16th most of the symptoms had cleared up. I had a slight headache and felt a bit tired, but much better. By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

                                                While driving home in traffic from getting the vaccine, I felt a tingling over my whole body and then everything started to spin (vertigo). This lasted for about 10 seconds of severe vertigo and then stopped. I thought that was weird and kept driving (was in stop and go traffic) then about 1 minute later it started again and thankfully I was stopped at the time in traffic. I leaned my  seat back slightly and called my wife to tell her where I am. I couldn&#39;t pull over because there was a cement barrier on one side and 4 lanes of traffic on the other. I kept on the phone with her for the remained of my drive and it occurred one more time when I was driving home. Once home, a couple more times I felt it coming on but it didn&#39;t ever happen again. I took my blood pressure and it was normal, boarderline high when I got home (140/84). The next morning I had a fever and severe muscle aches and body aches which lasted most of the day and then today I&#39;ve felt totally fine (today being 1/23).

                                                About an hour after I received my second shot I felt extremely hot and my knees and elbows started to hurt. I felt so hot that I walked outside to my car (about .3 miles away) in freezing cold temperatures with no jacket and didn&#39;t feel the cold at all. I developed a brain fog shortly thereafter and made several mistakes while performing my job throughout the day. My supervisor provided me with extra strength tylenol and within an hour or so the joint pains subsided. By 7 PM that night I had very bad chills and was shaking under a blanket on my couch. My temperature got up to 99.8 which is pretty high for me. I went back and forth between  feeling like I was freezing cold and on fire.  I got very little sleep that night and had disturbing dreams. The following morning all my joints hurt and I felt extreme exhaustion. I laid on my couch all day the day after receiving the shot and felt exhausted and and had no appetite. From 6 PM the day of the shot to 9 PM the following day I ate NOTHING and had no desire to eat. As I&#39;m typing this 60 hours after receiving the second shot the joint pain is  gone, the exhaustion is gone and my appetite is back to normal. There&#39;s a lingering pain at the injection site but otherwise I feel like I did prior to receiving the second shot.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had no known allergies. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination.  On 21Mar2021 at 07:30 PM, after receiving his first dose, he began noticing facial drooping, which began to intensify, on the right side. He was advised by a medical professional to immediately call an ambulance and he was then taken to an emergency room where received a CT scan and full bloodwork on Mar2021. Luckily, the facial palsy began to subside and he was able to return home after the test results came back and a stroke was ruled out - it was stated that this was some kind of immuno-reaction to the vaccine. He still felt as though his face was still not 100% back to normal and still felt a bit droopy (noticeable in the mirror) yet it does feel better than on 21Mar2021 evening. Patient had a nasal swab on 22Mar2021 with negative result. One of the reporters is a psychologist and reported that her son received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Psychologist asking about risk of Bell&#39;s palsy, incidence, and outcomes and if these patients received their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. She read about 7 cases of Bell&#39;s palsy in a Dec2020 article in the [Redacted], 4 of them on the Pfizer vaccine. The reporter further clarified and described that at 6pm (2 hours after dose), patient reported he felt fine and was happy he got the vaccine; but then sometime after that, he reported &#34;strange feelings in face&#34; and then eyes started drooping and then mouth started drooping, all on right side of face. They called the university clinic and was instructed to go to ER. Brain scans and blood work were done; they ruled out stroke and said it was a possible reaction to the vaccine. He was discharged at midnight and by then, paralysis was 80-85% resolved. He is an otherwise very healthy young man. The psychologist wanted to know the efficacy after just one dose and stated that a friend suggested to perhaps not get second dose and consider getting a dose of the non mRNA vaccine like Johnson and Johnson.  The outcome of the event was recovering.   Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                I began experiencing severe neck pain the morning after I received my first vaccine. The first morning, the pain was so intense that I was unable to lift my head out of bed and consequently had to lift the back of my neck with one hand to sit up in bed. I?d never experienced this kind of neck pain before.  The pain level was equally intense over the next several days until I started taking ibuprofen . I even went to the chiropractor to receive an adjustment to help reduce the pain. However, as of today,  I am still experiencing significant neck pain that is effecting my activities of daily living.

                                                Almost immediately after I received my dose, I felt very dizzy and began sweating profusely. My vision became very blurry, and I had trouble breathing. No one came to check and see if I was ok. They just waved me out of the building, being terrified of what was going on and what wanting to leave the facility I drove out into the parking lot for the additional assessment. In the parking lot, I continued panting and sweating, feeling as though I was going to vomit. Again, no one checked on me, and I was too incapacitated to &#34;honk my horn 3 times.&#34; After the additional 15 minutes, they waved everyone through to leave, so I left. There was no professional around to speak with at this point anyways. Covered in sweat and dizzy. I drove home to go to bed.  When I got home about 10 minutes later, my arm where I received the vaccine was already very sore. I laid in bed and fell asleep and continued sleeping off and on for the rest of the day and night. My shoulder was still sore the following morning when I woke up. As the day progressed my fatigue increased (Sunday was not too bad.) Monday (3.22.21) I felt terrible, (headache, brain-fog, bad back pain, bad knee pain, bad hip pain.) My symptoms have persisted all week. I am unsure as to what to do. I do not have a doctor that I regular see. I am afraid to receive another dose and have even worse reactions/side-effects

Patient swore this was related to the vaccine. This patient tested positive for COVID. He had a CT (computerised tomogram) scan which showed extensive infiltration in the lungs in Dec2020. Patient was admitted to the hospital on 24Dec2020 and then was moved to the ICU 2 days later, on 26Dec2020. Caller thought patient had a positive COVID test at another hospital. Caller did know that tested positive at the current hospital on 26Dec2020 which was done to confirm the previous positive test. Caller thought patient had his first positive COVID test either the same day or the next day after receiving the vaccine. Event of O2 Saturation of 80% / hypoxia was reported as hospitalization from 24Dec2020 and life threatening; infiltration in the lungs and shortness of breath caused hospitalization from 24Dec2020, muscle pain, chills and positive COVID test was reported as medically significant; and other events were reported as non-serious.  Outcome of O2 saturation of 80% / hypoxia and shortness of breath was not recovered, outcome of cough was recovering; and outcome of other events were unknown.

Second shot same as above but starting 24 hours after vaccine I developed left axillary pain. Able to palpate a lymph node ~1cm. Very painful on palpation. Has not limited activity but still painful. Was difficult to fall asleep  2 nights after vaccine. Now day 2 after vaccine still hurts, maybe incrementally better but taking ibuprofen. Cannot palpate significant lymphadenopathy otherwise.  No fever. I am a physician.

                                                Chills and muscle fatigue starting around 10:30am 1/12. Grew more intense throughout the day and into the night.  Had a fever starting around 3pm 1/12. Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

Took OTC acetaminophen and NDAIDs. Visited employees health who sent me to urgent care for neurological exam. Urgent care physician noted right arm weaker than left and recorded report of bilateral upper extremity paresthesia. Recommended follow up exam and cervical MRI if symptoms worsen or do not resolve within 7 days. Neck pain has improved but still present. Paresthesias still present. Right arm (dominant arm) still weaker than left. Will follow up with primary care physician this week if symptoms continue.  Additional side effects: headache, dizziness, nausea, shivers, fatigue, joint pain (all resolved within 72 hours).

                                                24 hr after vaccine, I had fatigue and generalized body aches and left arm pain at site of injection. I took tylenol.  Those stopped by the second day morning (day after vaccine). However, in the second morning ( day after vaccine) I started having pain on left side of neck and on Trapezius muscle on left shoulder blade - and had that pain for three more days. Range of motion for neck restricted for three days. All symptoms improved after four days. I took Lidocaine patch and Tylenol for neck and shoulder blade pain.

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

                                                I had the normal symptoms of pain at injection site, headache, fatigue, chills, muscle aches.  I did get a fever for a short duration.  The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

Approximately 10 hours after vaccination i felt very fatigued and tired and went to bed early. Approximately 12 hours after vaccination I woke from sleep with fevers (101.8), chills, and headache. I took tylenol, fever subsided,  and was able to return to sleep at approximately  4:00AM. I woke at 6:30AM with headache, dizziness, and fever (99-100).  I took more tylenol and fever and headache subsided. For remainder of day temperature would start in increase, but stayed below 99, and headache would return between doses of tylenol. I slept through the night of 1/9/2021 and woke 1/10/2021 without fever or headache, although I would experience dizziness with exertion above level of walking.  Today, 1/11/2021, I am not experiencing any symptoms.

Arm feels tight and is still pretty sore when reaching out and stretching it above my head.   No redness, itchiness, or discomfort around injection site.  Everything is in the middle of the upper arm.  The itchiness and prolonged soreness are my concerns, considering I still need a 2nd dose.

Also developed a slight chills feeling.  At the 21 hour mark, I was exhausted. Felt very weak and stared feeling a little warm. Around hour 22/23, body/bone aches developed.  By 24hrs after the 2nd vaccine, I took 800mg of ibuprofen (to help with the body aches and slight fever) and a Zyrtec for my allergies.  I&#39;m awake and getting ready for work again (I worked through the symptoms yesterday, somehow) approx 34hrs after the 2nd dose. I feel &#34;normal&#34; considering my arm is still sore from the shot. But all other symptoms appear to have subsided; my only tiredness is from waking up early for work.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Heavy sweating (sweating all over his body)&#34;, &#34;Head felt heavier; head was heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back&#34;, &#34;Throwing up; vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Nausea&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                4 days after the first shot I was feeling very very dizzy.   My ears felt full enough that I thought maybe they were just full of wax.  I bought an over the counter ear cleaning kit.  That didn&#39;t relieve any symptoms.  I never get headaches, but a couple days later the front top of my head was throbbing.  The area just above my forehead.  It was not sinus pressure, my face didn&#39;t feel any pressure or pain.  My throat also felt like I was being slightly choked.  Not my airway, but just my jugulars.  It began in the evenings.  It would feel like I had been hanging upside down for a while.  My head felt full of blood, like it was going to pop, like my eyes were bugging out.  By a week to 10 days later, my upper arms felt weak, my toes were tingling, and my heart would flutter for just a few seconds occasionally.  I was still dizzy, still felt like I was choking, except I was feeling this way all the time now.  The symptoms only seemed to be staying the same or getting worse.  I have NEVER gone to the doctor on my own in my life to get something checked, but this had me disconcerted enough to check in and see if I should get my second shot at all.  My appointment was to see my doctor was the morning of the same day I was scheduled to get my second Pfizer shot.  My doctor had not heard of these symptoms being associated with the Pfizer shot and chalked my symptoms up to stress.  I am not a stressful person and very much err on the side of &#34;waiting to see what happens&#34; if I feel sick.  I never feel sick.  But I accepted the explanation and took the second shot that day anyway.  It should be noted that the second shot made my left armpit swell up quite a bit.  I did feel dizzy again, but not nearly as much.  The other symptoms seemed to not be as bad either.

First night, it was very difficult to sleep - I did not get much. Dizziness was like being very drunk. Now every night laying down in bed looking up is dizzying, some nights worse than others but not as bad as first night of symptoms. This has been persistent for about a week. Some temporary dizziness when reorienting head quickly during the day, particularly looking up or down, but mainly worse at night in the dark, not debilitating. Sleeping with some low lights on helps reduce spinning feeling. Mild headache and tight neck/shoulders starting 9 days after injection but may be unrelated.

First couple of days were fine, but starting  26-FEB-2021, I&#39;ve been exhibiting all of the following: Fever - Friday 98, Saturday (3 measures over 5 hours) 99.1, 99.3, 99.4, Sunday 98.5, Monday 99.4 (at night, work up in body aches), Tuesday(97.5), Wednesday 98.5 Chills - mild, 1-3 times. comes and goes through past week.  Occurs more at night.  Feeling cold - wearing sweat pants, two shirts, long sleeve shirt, sweater, during sleep.  Constantly add/remove clothes to regulate temperature. During day, have sweat pants &#43; sweater on 78&#43; degree weather. Muscle pain - in back, moving daily. First started in right chest and back right shoulder, has now disappeared.  Now in middle of back, around spin area, hard and uncomfortable to sleep, taking IB profin helps alleviate pain, 2 to 3 tables over counter.  pain in throat around vocal box, could be due to sneezing, slight soreness to touch/aches. Feeling unwell - comes and goes, day starts fine, then around noon/1pm i get super tired and sleep.  Sleeping schedule is generally 10PM to 6AM &#43; naps through day Lose stools - from 25-FEB to 27-FEB, cleared up on 29-FEB Coughing - started on 03-MAR-2021, slight about 1 to 3 times an hour. Headache - comes and goes, use IB profin only when trying to sleep, all other times i let it be.  Good news: No swelling at injection site No redness at injection site  No Swelling at injection site  Final notes: Just feeling up an down, not taking anything besides IB profin for pain management. I was going to work everyday pre-shot with out issue. Post-shot, not feeling well enough to report to work out of fear of spreading anything that i got. Weekend immune system. Slightly grumpy demeanure since sick and interrupted sleep patterns.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

                                                Well I?m alive. It started about 45 minutes after taking the vaccine. It began as heavy salivating and turned into a numb tongue. I have never had an allergic reaction, so didn?t pay much attention to it. After returning home I became severely lightheaded and almost passed out. I immediately took a Benadryl and Motrin. Then my heart rate shot up to 160BPM according to my smart watch and maintained that for around 5 minutes. The home medicine helped it to subside, but the same feelings would return in moderate waves. By 2pm, I decided I should seek professional help and was taken to the ER by a family member. By this time I had moderate chest and jaw was very tight. At the ER I was monitored for 1 hour and then given an IV injection of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron(steroid). I immediately get relived and well. I was released from the ER around an hour later and sent home with a prescription of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone Oral Steroid. I have since had a few different side effects like chest pain, extremely flushed face, and low grade fevers. The medicine taken at home immediately stopped the face flushing.

                                                A few days after the shot, my lower back really started to hurt. So much, that I ended up in the ER thinking it could be kidney stones. ER staff were unable to determine the cause of the pain. Exactly one week after the shot (Tuesday), I start sweating profusely and nearly passing out at work. A day later (Wednesday), my heart rate went through the roof and I was dizzy, out of breath. By Friday night I was in an urgent care clinic with a resting heart rate of 145BPM. (My normal is in the 50s). I was diagnosed with Arterial Fibrillation. I have no history, or family history of heart issues. I run 3-5 days a week....3-10 miles at a time. In the military...very healthy.

Received vax and went home, slept 7 hours, got up and had an extremely strenuous workout including deadlifts (pyramid to heavy weight, 275lb x 5 reps in HIIT sets with kettlebell swings, and boxing in garage gym. Was 45 dF at the time. Patient was finishing workout with last 2 minutes boxing on a 100lb heavy bag and suddenly felt violent &#34;pop&#34; in right medial gastrocnemius muscle. Pt stopped workout and could barely put weight on right leg and reported back to work for shift within 45 minutes of event. Pt iced 4x per day for next 2 days (current), walking better by 2nd day but still very painful and unable to put much weight on forefoot. This has never occurred to patient. Possibly related to vaccine? Worth reporting

The burning in his back and skin got worse. He took some paracetamol (TYLENOL) in the morning and the headache started to go down. It came back again worse, so he took paracetamol again. He took two tablets of 500mg paracetamol and he tried to go rest on his break. He took a nap on his break for 15 minutes. When he got up from his nap, he found his achiness was much better. The burning was still there. It was getting less but still there. The headache was less when he woke up from the nap. Headache came back worse and he couldn&#39;t open eyes. He took paracetamol.

When I came back around 4pm I was feeling okay, no sore on the injection site, unlike my regularly flu vaccines that I mostly feel sore at injection site which lasts about few hours immediately after the flu shot, so it was sort of surprising to see that but later that night, my body starts feeling weak, aches and a tangling on my feet, as the night progresses up to the early morning, I was unusually fatigued and lightheaded with the regression of the muscle aches and subsequently other symptoms started disappearing, notably, I started feeling soreness on the injection site, which lingered to the next day.

Had first COVID-19 vaccination on 2/13.  Cannot exclude paraneoplastic syndrome; possible hilar mass noted on CXR will need further work-up to rule out sarcoid/malignancy. Concern for viral meningitis.  No known sick contacts. Another tonic-clonic seizure occurred around 08:00 on 2/24 AM with vomiting; no overt aspiration though certainly high risk given situation.&#34;

Very big and itchy. I took some Claritin. Those welts continued to grow and spread;  Upper inner arms, flanks, inner thighs.  Continued throughout the night  *took pictures of welts Took some Benadryl at night. Woke up; symptoms still there and extended even more to include hands. I went to work. I wasn&#39;t feeling ill but uncomfortable. Took some more antihistamines. It got worse thru the day. No SOB.  1/12 noon Different kind of rash, petechia in appearance.; shins. My knees, ankles, feet were starting to swell.  Hives had gone from the thighs and up, But below, shins to feet, were swelling.  1/13 I woke up to a lacy rash over all extremities. Bruising on shins. Knees, hands and feet still swollen.  Started Oral steroid. By noon that day, pretty much everything had cleared up. Six day course treatment, no symptoms came back. No fever. No SOB. I did miss work the 1/13 as it was at its worse.

                                                I experienced the normal moderate soreness after both injections as well as the expected mild flu like symptoms for about a day after the second injection.  The primary reason i am reporting an adverse effect is that I am still experiencing mild soreness in the shoulder muscle into which the vaccine was injected.  Occasionally, this soreness seems to be present in the other muscles of my upper arm as well.  This mild soreness has persisted and been very consistent ever since the initial moderate soreness from the first injection subsided about 2 months ago.  I have not experienced this type of lingering soreness following any previous vaccination.

Later that night after going to bed he woke up w/ his muscles and nerves twitching and tingling.  He says you can sometimes see the muscles spasms and then other times he feels it tingling under the skin. Pt is still having these symptoms. He had a sore arm for about 48 hours. For about 3 to 4 days he had a faster heart rate and higher blood pressure than normal.   He developed a headache that lasted about 2 days.  Currently he is having some brain fog  and his shoulder and biceps still have a heavy feeling like they are detached from his body along with the muscle twitching and tingling.  He does not feel like these symptoms are improving and will see his PCP on 3/29/2021.

The next day I started developing a rash on the right side of my torso on my chest and back. In a follow up appointment with the doctor and a visit to the ER I was diagnosed shingles. I was prescribed acyclovir and indomethicin. The rash has mostly cleared, but pain in both my torso and foot still persists.

Then he had some extreme fatigue, muscle ache/muscle pain, started developing cough, sore throat and headache. Then all of his joints were painful. Patient had a mild discomfort the day after at the injection site. The next day (on 23Dec2020) when he woke up nausea was gone.

                                                A few hours after injection, I began having discomfort in my left shoulder, the location of the injection.  Over the following next few hours I began to have overall body aches and pains in my joints.  My skin became extremely sensitive to the touch, a very strange hard to describe sensation.  I then began to get the chills, and running a fever.  Ultimately my fever spiked at 104 degrees.   I took a cold bath to bring the fever down, and for the rest of the night seesawed back and forth with fever using cold compresses and no sheets on my bed to keep my fever down.  I also took one 200 Mg Ib-Profen.  At roughly 26 hours after the injection, I no longer have a fever, but the body aches persist.

A 39-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686) intramuscularly in the right arm on 11Jan2021 at 8:30 (at the age of 39-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history included hypertension and migraines. The patient does not have allergies to medication, food, or other products. Historical vaccinations included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Lot number EK5730) in the right arm on 18Dec2020. Prior to vaccination, the patient had not been diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was administered the vaccine in a Hospital. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Beginning on 14Jan2021 the patient started to experience dysaesthesia in the right arm (upper arm on the posterior aspect and forearm) and right hip/thigh. Discomfort feels like pins/needles sensation anytime skin is touched lightly (such as blankets, clothing etc). As of the reporting date, the symptoms persist. In addition, the right shoulder, right elbow, and right hip joints are mildly sore which also are persistent. No perceived muscle weakness and no associated numbness. Treatment was not received for the events. Lab data included two post vaccination COVID 19 tests. A PCR nasal swab test on 11Jan2021 and a PCR nasal swab test on 17Jan2021 both of which were negative for COVID-19. The clinical outcomes of dysaesthesia, joint soreness and pins and needles were reported as not recovered.

                                                I had a sore arm that lasted about three or four days. It made it hard to hold anything heavy or lift it above my head for one day. One week later, I developed severe hives, and itching all over my body and it didn&#39;t stop until about 24 hours later. I went to urgent care. They put me on Prednisone.

                                                Around 5:30am I woke up feeling as though I had not slept well. I had chills, then I would sweat, then I would have chills again. I had severe fatigue, and muscle aches centering in my lower back. I took my temperature and it was 100 degrees. I took Aleve and laid back down. My fever subsided, but I continued to intermittently feel chills throughout the day. I took a warm bath and shower. I felt exhausted and the ache in my back continued. I laid back down from 5-11pm and continued to feel chills, though not as severe as they had been. In the evening, beginning around 7, when I would get up I felt a chill and a wave of paranoia, affecting my mental stability. These would subside when I laid back down. I retired to bed at 11 and woke up at 5am completely drenched in sweat. I changed clothes and returned to bed. When I woke up at 7:30am for work, I felt much better and have felt fairly normal, except for being dehydrated, since.
