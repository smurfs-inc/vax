By Tuesday 1/19/21, he was having shooting pains through his shoulder and down to his elbow. By late Wednesday, he had started to develop hives on his palm, between his fingers, and up to the elbow. Pt states he has a history of a pinched nerve in his neck and elbow, but this pain is nothing like his usual pain.  On 1/22, pt presented to the ED for left uper arm pain and rash. He denied new detergents, foods, clothes, wooded area exposure. Denied decreased ROM in shoulder, but ROM makes his shoulder sore. BP 161/82, otherwise vitals normal. Rash did not apear infectious. No evidence for DVT. Pt received ketorolac 30 mg IM x 1 in ED and was prescribed hydrocodone-APAP 5-325 mg tabs PO Q6h PRN #8. Pt was instructed to follow up with PCP in 1-2 days.  By 1/25/21, pt reports the hives have become dark purple, like bruises. He states he has trouble making a fist and is not using his left arm at all - when this writer spoke to him, he said it was &#34;gimpy.&#34; Pt stated during the phone call that he was about to call his PCP for a follow up appointment.

This hip occasionally hurts badly in weather change, but this time was unexpected, much more severe than ?normal?, and was not tied to weather. Pain was quite significant for about 24 hours, then subsided, and was normal again in 48 hours.   It hurt like hell for a day( day one being four days after injection), and then hurt a little in the second day, then was gone by day three.   On a scale of 1-10, the pain was a 9-10 for a day, then 6-7 for a day, then was fine.

A 60-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Jan2021 15:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history includes Hypertension, Gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), prostate cancer and broncholith left lung. The patient has no known allergy. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, losartan, pantoprazole, hctz, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN). The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730) on 17Dec2020 and experienced mild numbness and tingling in arms and legs following first dose of vaccine, followed by progressive weakness in legs. On 19Jan2021, the patient developed severe back and leg pain resulting in spinal fusion surgery on 25Jan2021. Postoperatively, the patient developed spastic twitching in thighs on 31Jan2021. On 07Feb2021, he woke up with weakness and clumsiness in left hand. At post-op check for spinal surgery on 10Feb2021, the neurosurgeon recommended another MRI and mentioned possibility of Transverse Myelitis. Following this MRI on 15Feb2021, he was again admitted to hospital for more extensive work up and was admitted for 6 days. Diagnosis made of Transverse Myelitis and was started on high dose steroid treatment and was discharged to home on 17Feb2021. Since then have had profound leg weakness, right side greater than left, which severely impairs mobility, especially stairs. He completed 5 day course of 1000 mg methylprednisolone per day as an outpatient on 20Feb2021. He is in PT and is unable to predict date of return to work. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Disability or permanent damage. Treatment for the events included high dose steroid therapy, PT and exercise. The patient underwent COVID test post vaccination via nasal swab on 24Jan2021 and was negative. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information the reported events are unlikely related to BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent medical conditions.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 60-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EK5730), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Dec2020 15:00 (at the age of 60years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), prostate cancer, broncholith left lung; all from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, losartan, pantoprazole, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN (E.C.)); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 18Dec2020, the patient initially experienced mild numbness and tingling in arms and legs following first dose of vaccine, followed by progressive weakness in legs. The patient was hospitalized for 6 days from an unspecified date to an unspecified date. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, and Disability or permanent damage. The patient was tested for Covid-19 post vaccination (Nasal Swab) 24Jan2021 with negative result. The outcome of events was recovering.

The next day arm was sore, perhaps sooner. Also, the next day I was lethargic/sleepy, had a slight chill and was sore in at least some joints, including ankles. No treatments other than staying in bed. The second day I was close to back to full energy.   Now a month later I&#39;m occasionally naps these days, which I wonder whether are prompted by the vaccination.

                                                On March 30th, the first skin rash / bump appeared on my right wrist and was very itchy. It expanded to an area about 1 inch x 2 inches and a week later continues to be itchy. Zyrtec helps reduce the itching (I only take 1/8 of a pill because a whole pill is too strong for me) On April 4, three additional spots about  1/2 inch in diameter appeared on and around my right nipple. Later that day, three other spots about 1/2 inch in diameter appeared on my LEFT shoulder. I got the short in my right arm. The chest and shoulder spots are only slightly itchy. I took pictures - hopefully later in this interview, I will be able to upload them.

It all got so severe that I didn?t eat for days at a time and was literally not with it.  Couldn?t respond when spoken to, and became excessively weak where I couldn?t walk w/o help, and speech was slurred.  It all lasted 5 days where it was so severe.  With medication it slowly began to back off.

He had to leave the job the other day because he just cant walk anymore, he has to do a lot of walking on the job. He called the doctor and told them something was wrong with his leg, they took an x-ray and nothing showed up. They did an MRI and all it shows was that his leg was swollen, no bones or nothing is broken. He was looking at Pfizer paperwork that a facility gave him and the two of symptoms are on there, so this problem was related to the vaccine. He never hurt his right leg, never had a problem until he got this shot. He was losing all his strength in his right leg, all the pain. They have been giving muscle relaxers and ibuprofen and they did not seem to work or be doing anything. First, he went to the emergency room and they gave him Ibuprofen 600 mg tablets and they gave him Cyclobenzaprine 10mg tablets. They said that he was experiencing muscle spasms in his neck because he has neck pain too. So he made an appointment with his family doctor, which there was no openings and had to see another PA. He did not know the HCP last name, but he/she was a PA in the office and he saw him/her, who requested the x-ray, and he had the x-ray done and saw him/her again and nothing showed up so he/she requested an MRI. He went to the hospital to have that and nothing showed up except his leg was swollen. Now they are going to send him to a bone specialist, but there was no reason to because now he stated he knew what was causing this. Patient took Cyclobenzaprine, 10 mg, three times a day by mouth. He states it did not seem to do nothing. Patient verified it was a prescription from the pharmacy:  NDC: 0137517-19674, unsure of LOT, expiry date. The quantity of the first bottle was 15 but he went through that already and he got a new bottle that has 42 in it. This current bottle he has 12 or 13 left. The first bottle was completely gone. Patient took Baclofen 5mg tablets, three times a day: morning, noon, and night. They were not doing anything either, well he did not think they are. Patient provided NDC: 0135391-19674. The first muscle relaxer they gave him, the 10mg one, he took it that day, it knocked him out. Caller states when he saw his doctor, he said he can not take that one while he works, he will take it at night time, so that is why the doctor gave him the other muscle relaxer, Baclofen, to take while he worked during the day. He took one muscle relaxer at night of one kind and the other kind he takes the ones that won&#39;t take him out as much. Patient stated that he had to leave his job because he cannot do it, he cannot walk. Patient took Ibuprofen (NDC: 0139246-19674, to use before 22Apr2022) 600mg, by mouth, three times a day. He took one with the muscle relaxers. Patient took verified all medications Cyclobenzaprine; Baclofen; Ibuprofen were prescriptions from the pharmacy. The outcome of muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg, his leg kept getting worse, was not recovered of he just can not walk anymore on, leg is swollen, neck pain was unknown. Reporter seriousness for muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg and neck pain was unspecified Patient received his second dose of Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine (LOT: EW0161, unsure if ER or EW) on 14Apr2021.  A Product Complaint was filed.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at the hospital. The patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) on 22Dec2020. Relevant medical history included high blood pressure and diabetes; both were diagnosed in 2006 and ongoing conditions and were under control. Concomitant medications included metformin, lisinopril for high blood pressure, and semaglutide (OZEMPIC, injection), which was a once a week injection kind of like &#34;Trulicity&#34; that encourages his body to make more insulin. The patient said that when he got the second dose of the vaccine on 12Jan2021, he got an achy arm and it went away. At the time of the report on 18Jan2021, almost a week later, he felt like he got the vaccine in his arm again and it was going into his shoulder. The patient was asking if it was normal. He was driving at the time of the call. The patient had been a scrub technician (tech) and an endoscopy tech for 20 years. During the first surge, when they shut down the outpatient surgeries, he went and worked as an aide in the COVID ward. He was glad to get the shot. He did what his kids would do when they were young and would get a shot. He took ibuprofen. Later that evening for the achy arm, he took more ibuprofen. The achy arm lasted only a day. He thought he wasn&#39;t going to have any side effects at all. It felt like a flu shot. The patient clarified that at the time of the report (18Jan2021), his arm felt achy like it was the day he got the shot and the day after. He got the vaccine as he was in the first bunch in the city and he works in healthcare and the fact that he was over 60 years old. The patient stated he could live through it and he was just curious. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The events did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. The patient had no relevant tests. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of achy arm, which included ibuprofen. The patient recovered from the event &#34;achy arm&#34; on 13Jan2021, while the outcome of the event &#34;felt like he got the vaccine in his arm again and it was going into his shoulder/ arm felt achy like it was the day he got the shot and the day after&#34; was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

He advised me to take Benadryl 15 minutes before receiving the injection.  I stayed at the vaccination site for an hour instead of 15 minutes. I left the vaccination site and went home and went to sleep, I worked over night. I did not sleep well that day. I got up around 6pm and I went to work at 10pm and I was extremely anxious and tired all night. I was a little confused while at work. I got off work and went to my chiropractor who noticed and my wife also noticed that I was extremely pale, after the appointment I went home and went back to bed. When I woke up I was still exhausted that I ended up calling out out of work that night.  I went back to bed and slept all night till 9am this morning. The next morning my color was back and I was looking better. My energy level is slowing  improving but still feel tired even when I got a good nights of sleep. I don&#39;t know if it related, but I went and brought some new shoes and then my hip started hurting. It is to the point where I set up a doctor&#39;s appointment on Monday to have my hip looked at.   See VAERS report 906796 for first dose reaction.

All other joints and areas in which I have minor aches and pains were very sore.   Mind somewhat clouded.  Modest temperature, 101. Chills.  Like a bad flu, but more pain and less congestion. Strong but not splitting headache. Not like a migraine--not at all as bad.  Very minor nose congestion and sore throat.  Symptoms all ended by 36 hours after 2nd shot

                                                After the vaccine he came home, felt a little less sore than a flu shot.  The next day when he took a shower, and when he went to wash under his armpit was very swollen, and very tender.   He put some ice on it which did not help the swelling.  It bothers him when his T-shirt touches the area, so he tried to wear a regular shirt.  He also had achy pain in his back, weakness in his arms, sore throat and a little cough, no fever.  The armpit still hurts and is still swollen.  Other than the ice he did not take anything else as he takes a lot of medications as it is.  He has not called his doctor because it happened over the weekend, but is going to call her today.   He did have a COVID test yesterday drive through facility at the community hospital as he has a surgery coming up, and they were going to call him if it was positive.  He is scheduled for surgery on his right knee on Thursday.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Jan2021 09:00 AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. He did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications to report.The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-1), on 09Jan2021 09:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization, at the age of 61-year-old. He experienced myalgia at the injection site/pain at inject site after the first dose on 09Jan2021 and resolved on 12Jan2021. The first and second doses of bnt162b2 had the same lot number. On 28Jan2021, the patient received the second dose of bnt162b2. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he experienced mild aches/pain, nausea/malaise. Three days (42-72hours) after 2nd dose, on 31Jan2021, he experienced &#34;significant redness&#34; and swelling at injection site with minimal pain. He described it as &#34;Out of proportion to what should be expected&#34;. The redness and swelling were improving at the time of the report (01Feb2021).  He asked if this should be of concern. He also asked if it was possible that the vaccine was given subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. He developed a good amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. It seemed fine the first day. It took two or more days to develop the swelling. He added that he only had mild myalgia, weakness, and nausea initially on 29Jan2021 after the second dose of the vaccine. Then 48 hours later, he got the large amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. He later clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 9Jan2021 at 09:30 AM in the left arm. He had some myalgia at the injection site on 09Jan2021 that went away on 12Jan2021. Then he received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 09:00 AM in the left arm. Initially he had no pain. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he had myalgia referring to general muscle pain and aches and nausea that only lasted about two hours. He is mostly concerned now about the significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain which he noticed 48 to 72 hours after the second dose of the vaccine. He took some Aleve which gave some relief (for significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain). He asked if this is an expected side effect as it seem out of proportion to him. Outcome of events general muscle pain and aches and weakness was recovered on 30Jan2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 29Jan2021. Outcome of events significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain was recovering. The reporting physician (patient) assessed the causality between the suspect vaccine and all events as related. He assessed the events &#34;swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain&#34; as medically significant (serious), while he assessed the other events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known product safety profile of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), the contributory role of the product cannot be totally excluded.

Prior to getting this second shot I had been verified several times and my wife was there at the same time at the same table also getting her second shot. When I went to sit and wait the 15 minutes, a representative came to me and ask to speak in privacy. She advised me that there had been a mistake and you were given PFIZER not MODERNA. I need your card to mark it right. I advised her that I was extremely upset and confused since all of this is so new.....I then asked her if this had ever happened before here and she advised me yes it has happened to a total of 3 people. i was shocked to hear this...i am experiencing left buttocks and left leg discomfort.....After my first shot I had NO side effects......Am I worried, yes.

Soft high-frequency crickets when my throat gets stressed, including hiccups, burping, stretching, sometimes yawning, muscle tensing, sometimes swallowing, stretching to wake up in the morning.  Last for the duration of the stress, a few seconds.  Left eustachian tube slightly sore, slight earache.  Has gone on for almost a week now.   Best guess is nerve is pressured or damaged?  Will try hydroxide in ear next, in hope it kills whatever&#39;s going on.  Whether this will go away or not is unknown at present.

In the morning (about 7:30) I noticed a rash all over his trunk (small pink spots) As the result of the falls, he hit chin and cut it. Hit left temple and bruised it. Back is very sore and painful. May have cracked rib(s). Currently 2:20 pm on March 14. He is no longer experiencing the dizziness. The rash seems to be clearing up (brownish spots instead of pink spots on trunk). He&#39;s resting.

A 62 years old male consumer reported that he received second dose of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8733), via an unspecified route of administration, on 26Mar2021 at 12:00 in Arm Left (at the age of 62-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  The first dose of bnt162b2 was received on 05Mar2021 (Lot: EN6205). Medical history included diabetes mellitus, hypertension from, gastrooesophageal reflux disease from 1977, sleep apnoea syndrome from 2000, pain from 2017, blood cholesterol increased from 2013, vitamin D deficiency from 2013, depression from 2000. Concomitant medications included glipizide for diabetes mellitus; lisinopril started about 1982 or 1983  for high blood pressure; metformin hcl for diabetes mellitus; terazosin hydrochloride from 1987 prescribed for Benign hyperplasia of prostate (BPH) but it turned out to be something else, but he still takes this medication because it helps with his urination; famotidine for acid reflux; amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken for narcolepsy; oxycodone for pain from 2017; VITAMIN B12  for vitamin deficiency from 2016; calcium citrate from 2019 for blood in his urine; fish oil for blood cholesterol from 2013; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3) from 2013; ketamine hcl for depression, and CANNABIS he used it recreationally and probably medicinally too because it helps him sleep. He is not a daytime stoner, he just uses it at night to relax and go to sleep. He started about 2009, when he got a medical card. Caller reported had his vaccine shot at noon on 26Mar2021. He stated he felt fine, he was just tired a little early and went to bed at 10. He woke up at midnight with a headache and a delirious fever. He didn&#39;t test his temperature or anything but it was high enough to where he got delirious, but he doesn&#39;t know how high that was.  He took Tylenol 2500mg capsules which helped with the headache and not the fever, so 4 hours later, he took Ibuprofen  800 mg which seemed to helped with the fever. He stated the headache is gone. Caller stated delirious feverish was gone but then clarifies he doesn&#39;t know if he has recovered completely actually, it feels like he has, but these things are funny sometimes. Caller reported muscle aches started around midnight on 26Mar2021, and were gone by 27Mar2021. Further Caller reported he had swollen joints- his hands, knuckles. He adds his arms and shoulders, but he doesn&#39;t know if that was from laying on them all night for as long as he did because he slept all the next day, too. The swollen joints seems to be resolved at this point. He clarifies all the symptoms started around midnight on 26Mar2021, about 12 hours after the shot. He confirms that he did not have swollen lymph nodes.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 63-years-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 21Dec2020 14:40, at a single dose for Covid 19. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient has no prior vaccinations -within 4 weeks. The patient is an EEG technician. On 22Dec2020, the patient reported the next day he started to feel sluggish, chills, tired/fatigue, pain all over his body, patient mentioned he has lost weight everyday since he got the shot from 153 pounds to 142 pounds; then on Wednesday evening 23Dec2020, it was a nightmare, he got sweating; fever with a high of 101.4 Fahrenheit; he was running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; and he was so tired and fatigued. Added when he was getting up all that night he was having night sweats up to five times a night and chills; and his heart was pounding. The urination, heart pounding resolved the next day. All of these events have improved at the time of report (now) or gone away but he is still sweating once at night for the last two days and he is tired and fatigued. He stated that he is scheduled for the second dose on 11Jan2021 and he is concerned if he should take the vaccine. He mentioned that he was tested for COVID 19 on 18Dec2020 and the result was inconclusive. He went again 23Dec2020 they called him on 25Dec2020 and informed he was positive per the PCR test. He treated himself with 500mg acetaminophen (UPC 0904672059; lot OBE2896 and expiration Oct2021) and azithromycin Z-Pack (NDC 65862-641-69; Lot ZYSA20012-A; and expiration date Mar2022). The sample of the product is not available to be returned. Predisposing factor was that the patient&#39;s wife was at home and was sick too at the same time. She was tested Sunday with no results yet. The outcome of the events of fever recovered on 28Dec2020, sluggishness recovered on 29Dec2020, pain all over the body was recovered on 02Jan2021; running to the bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine and heart pounding were recovered on 24Dec2020, weight loss was not recovered, and for other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (4 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between event &#34;COVID-19 PCR test/he was positive per the PCR test&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / SARS-CoV-2 test positive) and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded

A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 13Jan2021 09:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included taking blood pressure medicine, medicine for uric acid, stated he takes three medications but did not provide product names. The patient had the first COVID shot on 23Dec2020 at 20:30 at the right arm at the age of 63-year-old and clarified he had no problems after first vaccination. The patient experienced leg pain and bruising which started immediately day after second COVID shot on 14Jan2021. Noticed bruising above both kneecaps and down his legs, which felt like pretty severe flu pain. After a period of time, it didn&#39;t&#39; feel right. He didn&#39;t see anything like that listed as side effects. Has gotten a little better but was still there. Takes Ibuprofen and it helps a little with the leg pain and bruising. Feet are a little colder than normal and he still aches, also had muscle aches on 14Jan2021 which he never had before. The outcome of the event leg pain and bruising was recovering and unknown for the rest of the events.  Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.

                                                The vaccine was given in the left arm. The left arm began to tingle and get heavy as expected.  However, during the 15 minute waiting period after receiving the vaccine, the left side of my face began to feel ever so slightly thick and numb. It felt as if I had been to the dentist for a filling a hours ago.  I never lost speech or had a discernable facial deformity, but the numbing caught me off guard.   The facial feeling faded in about the same manner as the arm recovery.

                                                Woke up on Sunday 3/28/2021 with a sore neck and back of the head, sore arm, underarm, and shoulder.  At first, I thought I had just slept wrong but the symptoms did not decrease for a couple of days.  On  Tuesday 3/30/2021 I began taking a stress dose of Hydrocortisone (I have Adrenal Insufficiency due to surgery to remove a Pituitary Tumor).  I contacted my Primary Care the next day, by phone and after discussing my symptoms he diagnosed me with lymphadenopathy.  I continued the stress dose until Saturday 4/3/2021 when I began to taper off.  Symptoms are considerably decreased but not completely gone, nevertheless I intend to get the second dose on Tuesday 4/6/2021 based on my discussions with my PC.

By 10:30pm, I began having flu like symptoms, (aches, low grade fever, sinus symptoms) took another acetaminophen 1 GM.  At 11:00 pm, developed severe rigors that lasted for approximately 2 hours. I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

He had shoulder pain and it was hurting the day after he got the vaccine on Friday 22Jan2021. Rash started on Sunday 24Jan2021, it was like a chicken pox type rash. It was like red dots that become sensitive and look slightly blistered. Shoulder pain: this was nothing compared to the pain of the rash and blisters (24Jan2021). He had taken off the bandage and was sore. He was not even sure if he was still sore or not because he was only paying attention to everything else. It was overwhelming. Treatment: He called his doctors and they said that he should use Calamine lotion as a temporary soother for itch and rashes. They also told him to take Benadryl and his doctor prescribed Prednisone. Outcome of the event shoulder pain was unknown while the other events was not recovered.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

I ignored it.  By bedtime 10/11 PM Thursday night I had pain in my neck on the right side that felt like I had been in a bad car accident.  By 4 O&#39;clock in he morning the pain was almost unbearable.  I got up and did an hour of stretching and it became bearable.  I had finally taken a  8 MG HYDROMORPHONE tablet just before 4 AM that the doctor had given me last summer for falling over a pile of lumber and landing on my back on a 4 x 4 board.  That helped some.    Ever since then, the pain in my neck has gone from a 4/10 to a 9/10 in pain and the headaches have clustered on the left side of my head.  The worst ones are just below my left ear.   It is now Saturday night and the neck pain is not as bad but it is not gone either,  It still hurts to turn my head, cough or when I get up or down.  I did not do anything physically to cause this.

                                                I had the Pfizer vaccine, 1st and 2nd. The first one gave me the reaction most people say the 2nd one gives, although not quite as bad as what others have described. HOWEVER, the 2nd dose in my case, cause a severe flare-up of arthritic type symptoms in my joints, mostly both knees but no feverish reactions. When I say severe arthritic flare up, I mean debilitating to the point where it almost hurts too much to walk. I had the shot on a Friday, the arthritic pain began late that night and became worse on Saturday. It is now Monday and the pain has only subsided a little bit. It&#39;s still difficult to get up from a sitting position and to walk or stand for longer periods of time.

The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

The injection site arm pain was severe in the middle of night, and woke him up in the middle of the night. When he rolled over, he explained that he used both arms to help get out of bed and he could barely get up to go to the restroom. He was wrapped up so the chills were pretty good, when he woke up they were racking chills (which he also experienced these type of chills when he had the COVID virus). No treatment was received.

                                                One week after getting the first Pfizer vaccine, my superficial vein thrombosis returned with a vengeance. I had gotten the vein ablation treatment several years ago for varicose veins, and the problems I had went away, but one week after the first shot, my calf muscle was swollen and felt sore and aching, and the rest of the leg was in pain, just like it was before getting the vein operation. The varicose veins returned and my leg now has prominent black and blue areas on it, like it had before my surgery. I&#39;m returning to the vein clinic in two weeks for them to look at it. My leg still hurts.   I should also add that my arm is still sore where they gave me the shot. My strength has not yet fully returned, even though I work out in the gym regularly.

                                                About an 1 1/2 hours after getting my first shot I had what I can only describe as a RUSH/High energy feeling along with a soreness in my chest around my heart area. Lasted for about  2 hours and that was it no other symptoms that I noticed.  Then after getting my second shot had the same thing only much more intense to the degree I was worried I may be having the start of a Heart Issue. This last for a couple days. And now I?m about 14 days after my second shot and my heart area feels much better but my whole back from my neck almost to my waist feels like sore and achy. Never had fever chills shortness of breath or anything really other than what I?m describing above. I?m starting to feel a little better each day. I just boy wanted to report this because I could not find anyone else who had felt like this after the shot. Thank you

A 65-year-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular on 24Jan2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was hospital.  Medical history included &#39;Cryptogenic cirrhosis s/p liver tx 20Jun2020, T2DM on insulin, Factor V Leiden, CAD s/p stent x3 (2008), hyperlipidemia&#39;, NSAIDS allergy. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), carvedilol, citalopram, ergocalciferol, insulin glargine (LANTUS), melatonin, metformin, omeprazole, senna alexandrina (SENNA).  The patient previously took atorvastatin and experienced Allergies to Atorvastatin, promethazine and experienced Allergies to promethazine, tolmetin and experienced Allergies to tolmetin, INSULIN for T2DM (Type 2 diabetes mellitus). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Bilateral lower extremity weakness and pain and paresthesia in bilateral hands and legs on 26Jan2021. Symptoms began two days after first dose of the Pfizer vaccine (received on 24Jan2021) and have continued to progress over the last 2.5 weeks. His neurological exam now (10Feb2021) includes areflexia throughout, patchy weakness in RLE &gt; LLE, decreased sensation to pinprick and B/L CN 7 weakness. His lumbar puncture showed no WBC and significantly increased protein to 107 in 2021. This is all consistent with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP or Guillain Barre Syndrome) likely secondary to COVID vaccination given temporal association in 2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lumbar puncture: no WBC and significantly increased protein to 107 in 2021, neurological examination: areflexia throughout, patchy weakness in RLE &gt; LLE and B/L CN 7 weakness on 10Feb2021, Rapid SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) by PCR Nasopharyngeal swab on M4 (NASO): negative on 06Feb2021, skin test: decreased sensation on 10Feb2021. The adverse events result in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Hospitalization for all the events. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events (IVIg). The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, patient developed signs and symptoms which were consistent with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP or Guillain Barre Syndrome) likely secondary to COVID vaccination given temporal association.

                                                A couple of days after the vaccine, back muscle (upper back, left side- the same arm of vaccination) started hurting. Since then, the pain is constantly there BUT it moves to various locations, only on the left side, sometimes in muscles, sometimes in shoulder joint and often at the site of vaccination. The pain, while it moves around, is only at one location, often in addition to the vaccination site. Thus it can be in left shoulder joint and the site. Or it could be the site and at the shoulder- neck joint. Never has the pain migrated to the right side and is confined to the left arm, shoulder, upper back area. Naturally the pain dulls upon taking a couple of Tylenol?s or Advil?s but otherwise has been there no -stop for about two weeks, shortly after the  vaccination. Avery slight swelling can be felt at the injection site.

I am still experiencing pain and difficulty walking or standing for more than a few minutes.

A 65-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at same age, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 09Feb2021 13:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EH9899) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing bronchitis chronic, pneumonia, ongoing back issues, which has been suffering from back issues for 20 years, ongoing psoriatic arthritis, ongoing psoriasis, liver transplant from 29Oct2013 to an unknown date, muscle spasms, heart rate, depression, anxiety attacks, blood pressure and hernia. Concomitant medication included amlodipine for blood pressure and ongoing and he began taking years ago, carvedilol for heart rate and ongoing that he began taking over 10 years ago and stated that it is to keep his heart rate between 70 and 80 beats per minute; pravastatin and ongoing that he began taking about 5 years ago; sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT) for antidepression and ongoing that he has been taking for 2 or 3 years; alprazolam (XANAX) for anxiety attacks and ongoing that he has been taking for over 10 years; cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (FLEXERIL [CYCLOBENZAPRINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) for he didn&#39;t cramp up and ongoing that he has been taking for 5-10 years; mycophenolate and everolimus both from 2013 and ongoing for anti-rejection since his liver transplant in 2013. While providing concomitant medications he mentioned details about a historical medication. He was on bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), but was switched to Zoloft. He was switched because he had built a resistance to the bupropion hydrochloride and had to move up in the class. The patient experienced tired on 10Feb2021, felt like he was getting a cold on Mar2021, little cough on Mar2021. The patient was hospitalized for infection after hernia surgery (infection) from 22Feb2021 to 24Feb2021. For chronic bronchitis, patient stated that he was never really diagnosed, that it&#39;s just like having a cough all the time. It felt like his lungs are not big enough for his body and that he got winded quickly.  He was strong and could do manual labor, even after the liver transplant, but that he has noticed the last couple of years that the cold felt like it&#39;s freezing his skeleton. He has had pneumonia 3 times altogether. He was unable to specify dates but he knew that he had it post-transplant in 2013. There isn&#39;t a test for psoriatic arthritis so he was unable to provide a diagnosis date.  He had been experiencing this for the last 10 years. He was diagnosed with psoriasis when he was 25. He had his first shot done, clarified as the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He was supposed to go back to get his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine but was hospitalized briefly after hernia surgery with complications and got an infection. Therefore, he didn&#39;t make his appointment. Patient stated that his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is now scheduled for 21Mar2021 but he would like to schedule it for somewhere closer. He was a liver transplant patient and that the hospital where he received the transplant likes to keep things in house. After the hernia surgery he couldn&#39;t drive or sit down because it was uncomfortable and that the jostling of the car was too much. Patient reported that he would see his physician who recently retired once a month for a prescription for pain meds that he needs for back issues, psoriatic arthritis, and scar tissue from being operated on 4 times. He has had about 10 Covid tests. It made people feel more comfortable when he shows them the negative results. He has been stressed over waiting for the Covid test, that the stress then aggravates the psoriasis which aggravates the arthritis. After the vaccine he clarified he did not feel right. He said that he didn&#39;t feel sick, just wasn&#39;t 100%. He was tired and felt like he was getting a cold after receiving his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Which he did, he had a cold/cough. He felt tired the next day and only for a couple of days after. He confirmed the tired feeling has resolved completely. Patient stated that he thought the hernia surgery was already scheduled, and stated that the liver clinic called him and said that he had to come in a certain day at a certain time. He received the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine 4 days before surgery. For infection after hernia surgery, patient reported that he couldn&#39;t remember the hospital dates but that he was admitted for 2 days and received IV antibiotics. He was hospitalized on 22Feb2021 or 24Feb2021.  His doctor had told him that the swelling was from the trauma of the procedure. For little cough and felt like he was getting a cold, patient reported that he had been on oral antibiotics after his surgery and his doctor increased the dosage to help with the respiratory infection, it was a cough. Feeling like getting a cold started like a week ago. He was not coughing up green or red, just light brown. Patient unable to provide NDC number or expiration date as they were not listed on his card. He was a liver transplant patient so he&#39;s on immunosuppressants. He stated that he is 65 and if he gets Covid he&#39;s a dead pigeon and that he doesn&#39;t see himself surviving the pulmonary aspect. Mentioned he has had pneumonia a few times in his life, post transplant, and has bronchitis. Patient stated that Micophenylate/ Everlimus were actually poison that fool body into thinking that&#39;s liver.  Caller stated that they lower immune system so didn&#39;t fight it.  He got more colds and if he got a cut on hand it would get infected. Patient stated that he had labs done and a CT scan and labs when he was hospitalized for the infection after his hernia surgery and that everything came back normal. He was just having pain. Vaccine administered was not at facility and vaccination facility type was hospital. Nonadditional administered vaccines. No AEs require a visit to emergency room but physician office was required. He went to the doctor for the little cough that he experienced. He was hospitalized for the infection following his hernia surgery. Patient hospitalized for 2 days was the hospital stay. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no ae following prior vaccinations. The outcome of event tired was recovered on unspecified date in 2021 (as reported), the outcomes of events felt like he was getting a cold and little cough were recovering, while other events were unknown.

My lymph  node was swollen approximately the size of a tennis ball and hanging down approximately 4&#34; under my left arm pit.  I tucked the lymph node back under my arm and squeezed my arm against my side for approximately 1 hour.  The lymph node no longer hung under my arm pit.  I then used ice pack and a heating pad to for the next 5 days aid in reducing the swelling.  As of this date (04-02-2021)  the lymph node is still slightly swollen approximately 1&#34;  to  about 1 1/2&#34;.  A little tender when pushing on it, but not painful.  This was the only side effect I had after receiving both Pfizer Covid 19 vaccinations.

He reports pain started out as aching in his neck and down into his back. His pain got worse and he went to see a chiropractor the next day, where he had massage and neck manipulation which temporarily provided some relief but then the pain worsened. He was seen in ER that night for neck pain and spasms. He was treated with Valium and DC with Rx for Flexeril. He took several doses but pain persisted. This morning, he noticed tingling in bilateral hands, as well as tingling and inability to move his legs. He called EMS and was brought to ED for evaluation. Pt was evaluated by neurologist, was found to be quadriplegic. He was immediately ordered for CT head, CT cervical spine as well as MRI of cervical and thoracic spine. Imaging is notable for enlargement of the spinal cord from the C2 down to C7-T1. Felt to be likely transverse myelitis. Pt also noted to have superimposed cervical spinal stenosis, most significant at C5-6.  The patient was then taken for emergency neurosurgery for a C3-C7 decompressive laminectomy, medial facetectomy on 4/16/2021. Due to lab work findings an infectious workup was completed, patient noted to have MSSA positive blood cultures, and subsequent ECHO demonstrated mild to moderate aortic valve calcification and mobile strands of the aortic cusp.  Treatment was begun for endocarditis.

By evening about 12 hours post vaccine felt fatigue and some increase in mild baseline myalgias.  During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

                                                Back ache; some soreness in his arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 66-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 12Jan2021 09:15 at single dose in the left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Medical history included prostate cancer from 3 years. Having aches and his back bothering him predates taking the vaccine. A while ago he blew out his knee and his shoulder and three years ago he started having trouble with his back. Family Medical History: heart disease.There were no concomitant medications. He had the flu vaccine from the VA and it can be a little bit of a thing but the last one it ached, made his shoulder worse; the ache lasted six months but it might have been the way it was administered. He has no product or information to provide NDC, lot or expiration date for the flu vaccine he received about two years ago. Mentions he swore off the flu vaccine after that. He was at the VA yesterday for some other business and they told him the shot was available to him so he had it. He is planning to get the second dose on 02Feb2021. He used to take blood thinners and he imagines, like with the blood thinners, that they wouldn&#39;t want him to stack Tylenol on top of the vaccine. He has a few aches and his back is bothering him; which is normal for him; but he would like to know if he can take Tylenol for his back. He noticed some soreness in his arm, a little, when he got home two or three hours later. His sister said to rub it to disperse the medication, so he did. Adds it is not a big deal. Recently he has not been sleeping well; which is also normal for him; so today he slept in; he may have slept too long on his back but his back is aching and he wanted to take some Tylenol for his back. The patient experienced some soreness in his arm on 12Jan2021 with outcome of recovering , back ache on 13Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered.  Treatment received for the event. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On 02/12/2021 around 11:00am I was assigned to have Covid 19 shot at the table#6. At that time I saw the Vaccine was already in the syringe which was in the plastic bag with zipper. Ten days after the shot I felt well, no pain nor swell on my left shoulder. But in the morning of 02/23/2021 after waking up I started to feel hurt to my left arm and the pain was transmitted to the left of my back (left lung). During these 3 days 23,24,25 my pain reached the maximum intensity 10/10 even I took 3 times a day Ibuprofen which was each time 2x200mg. On 02/26/2021 I went to Hospital in the Emergency Unit and after diagnosis the Doctors found that I had 3 heart arteries clog-up. How can I be sure that the liquid in the syringe is the Pfizer Vaccine or something else? I used to see the TVs broadcast on the Covid 19 shot that the nurse inserts the syringe in the small Pzifer bottle, suck the Vaccine into syringe and inject  the vaccine into the shoulder of the patient. Can CDC require that all Covid 19 providers show the vaccine to all patients before the shot? In 2017 I had an Angiogram and my 3 bypasses were not clogged why they are all clogged now? I don&#39;t change my every day diet and I&#39;m very careful with eating fat, cholesterol and salt in my everyday food.

The patient stated, &#34;My wife and I have received Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine, yesterday, around this time, noon. I was fine. I didn&#39;t feel any discomfort in my shoulder but later on at night, it started getting sore on 30Jan2021. And then, this morning 31Jan2021, I woke up with a soreness, really bad in my shoulder, my left shoulder and also my left side of the neck. And I woke up really like dizzy and achy bones. My hands were very stiff which I have never experienced that. And I was a little scared if that was a side effect and if they are going to continue for a long time? No lab work done&#34;. The patient took Tylenol or Aleve 6 hours apart as treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                My wife &amp; I are unsure if what we both are experiencing is just coincidental or actually the cause as a result of the 2nd dose shots we both received but we are both experiencing similar events approximately a week&#43; after the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Her information is as follows: Pt age 64, same address &amp; contact information as listed for myself, 1st Pfizer dose 2/6/21 EL9264, 2nd dose 3/1/21 EN6202. We had no immediate event after both shots except for soreness in upper arms at injection sight and this ceased after approximately a day. But as mentioned at a week&#43; of 2nd dose we both started having a severe aching pain. Her pain is in her right knee. My aching pain is in my right hip down my leg to my knee &amp; chin/calf area. It was very difficult to put weight on the leg to walk. We have been icing the areas and taking pain over the counter medication Aleve which has helped somewhat but we are still experiencing as of the date of this submission.  It seems strange we both are experiencing similar issue at approximately the same time.  Coincidence?  Due to reaction to the vaccine?  We are submitting this report to see if it might be and if others have experienced this issue. We are unaware of any physical activity  we may have done during this time to have caused this pain to start occurring. Thank you for any response.

                                                First I have not suffered any injury since getting the vaccine.Arm and shoulder area has increased in pain until heat was applied on March 10, 2021. Next day pain was increased and range of motion declined. By Friday, March 12th I could not raise arm more than 6 inches. Went to the Dr. on 3/12/21 and was referred to the Orthopaedics. Saw PA on 3/12/21. Xrays were taken I believe the diagnosis is in part subacromial bursitis.. Received Cortisone shot. Range of motion was much improved and has stayed about the same through today. Iced shoulder last night because of mild pain. Woke up in considerable pain which has continued today. I have iced the shoulder and upper arm at other times also since 3/10/21.

                                                Intense pain in lower back and neck in and around where I have mild disc degeneration.  The pain is right where the affected discs are located and radiates outward.  Symptoms began 18 - 20 hours following the vaccine, and became much worse over the next 24 hours.  I also had suddenly had an elevated body temperature and broke out in a sweat in the middle of the night (about 36 hours following shot).  That lasted only 10-15 minutes and then went away on it&#39;s own.   I had the exact same experience following the first shot (2/23/2021, Pfizer Lot #6201).  The symptoms were odd, and I didn&#39;t realize at the time that it might have been connected to the vaccine, so I didn&#39;t report it.  After receiving the second shot and having the same symptoms with the same timeline, it seems that it is likely a reaction to the vaccine.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

I could hardly sleep all night from pain and aches. The next morning I had a hard time using my legs and could hardly lift anything, that lasted all day wednesday into thursday. Thursday the pain lessened and the weakness became less but I started getting pain in my hips and  heavy painful bloating feeling in my intestinal area. That lasted all day and into Friday (today). Today (Friday) the pain in my arms subsided, legs got  better (no pain but still weak) but the intestinal issues are keeping me incapacitated and the top of my hips ache.

At the time I thought that the symptoms were likely due to overuse from  resistance  exercise .  The symptoms did not improve after a change in exercise routine. On January 5, I experienced left knee pain after exercising on an elliptical machine. I received my second Covid-19 vaccine on January 8. Subsequently I experienced severe joint pains and muscle aches for 2 days. The severe pain subsided somewhat, but I then developed a symmetrical polyarthritis involving my wrists, elbows, ankles and knees with marked knee effusions.  i experienced severe morning stiffness. I was ultimately diagnossed with sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis

Caller reported that her father was not actually admitted to the hospital, he was taken to the ER and was there for maybe 6 hours before his body just snapped out of the reaction, and he was discharged home that same day.  Follow up information has been requested.

                                                the day after vaccination, I had a recurrence of severe pain in my left knee (arthritis) and both shins and calves (myopathy).  In the past I have managed my arthritis and myopathy through stretching, exercise and weight management. I had no pain prior to the injection for many many months. I could not exercise for several weeks because of the pain. Given the severity of the pain and the fact I had not experienced it for several months prior to the injection, I strongly believe the reaction was caused by the vaccine (Pfizer).

She stated that the dehydration and constipation could have been self induced. This started about last week and was home all week. It may have been around 29Mar2021, about 2 weeks after the vaccination. On day 3, her husband had headaches and fatigue on 17Mar2021. The patient was taking Tylenol pretty much every four hours for a week because he was in so much pain. The patient wear APAP machine at night. No history of all previously immunizations. No additional vaccines administered on same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events was considered related to suspected vaccine BNT162B2 based on temporal association and known safety profile of the drug. however, the contribution of age and underlying medical conditions cannot be excluded.

He had a very bad headache on the left side of his head, right next to his left eyeball on 07-APR-2021. The patient stated that he could not get any relief, tried to take Tylenol but nothing helped. He also had diarrhea on 07-APR-2021, &#34;couldn&#39;t hold anything in&#34;, and started to get dehydrated in APR2021. The reporter states that then that weekend on the 10Apr2021 at night getting a high temperature going up to 103 degrees/fever.  On 13Apr2021, his son told him that he better get to the ER. At the ER, he did a chest X-ray and another PCR test to confirm the COVID19 diagnosis. On the chest X-ray they found something unusual in his chest so they did a &#34;contrast cat scan&#34; and found pneumonia on 13-APR-2021. He was admitted the hospital on 13Apr2021 and was discharged on 16Apr2021. He is now scheduled for his second dose of the vaccine one 21Apr2021. He went to a clinic yesterday for a PCR test and it came out positive. He&#39;s getting conflicting information as to what needs to be done, some people are telling him he has to wait for 3 months, other are telling him to notify his PCP. He&#39;s wondering if he can get his second dose as planned on 21Apr2021. The patient stated that while he was in the hospital, they did a CAT scan. Caller reports that first they did an X-ray of his lungs and found something in lungs.

The patient stated that he didn&#39;t have a follow up PCR at the hospital because the hospital doesn&#39;t normally do it. PCR test still came out positive yesterday 18Apr2021. Caller states that his big question is that he is scheduled to get the 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine on 21Apr2021 and since he is still testing positive for the COVID virus, is he still required to get the second Pfizer COVID vaccine or does caller have to wait. The patient stated that he is getting conflicting answers, some say you can&#39;t get the second shot for at least 3 months but the caller doesn&#39;t know how true that is.  The patient stated that he tested positive for the COVID virus on 8Apr2021, caller went to a testing center. The patient stated that it was getting annoying, it was not the COVID symptoms.

The patient stated that he was diagnosed with pneumonia on 13Apr2021 and he is not sure if it is ongoing or not. He asked the hospital before discharge about if they were going to check again for the pneumonia the answer was we normally don&#39;t test and that caller needs to go to his PCP doctor to see if the PCP will order another test for the pneumonia. The patient stated that it would have been easier for them to check again while caller was still in the hospital already.  The events sore throat, fever, cough require a visit to Emergency Room.

Started 2 days after shot with only other symptoms being the return of sore muscle and fatigue that I had with a Covid infection in mid-Nov.  Shot reaction has been more drastic than the Covid illness for me which was fairly mild.

Hx of severe recurrent acute sinusitis until the age of 40. Being sheltered in place since Apr 2020.  Beginning Jan 2021 I started experiencing a little yellowish nasal discharge with slight nasal congestion and occasional pressure in the maxillary sinuses. On Jan 21 received the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Because of no improvement with symptomatic treatment of sinusitis, on Feb 3 started Augmentin 500 mg 3 times a day. On Feb 7, symptoms became much worse: fever 38.2C (100.7F), chills, muscle aches but the most troubling symptom was severe (level 8) face pain. Bouts of pain lasted for a few seconds but repeated about every 30 sec. It felt like an electric shock originated in the nasopharynx and extending to the maxillary sinuses. Pain affected both sides of the face but mostly the right side. Additional symptoms: scalp tenderness, neck pain and light stiffness while moving, skin hyperesthesia. On Feb 8, underwent PCR COVID-19 testing, which was negative.  On Feb 12, canceled the 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, rescheduled for Feb 19. Since Feb 14 no pain and fever.  Treatment:  1. Because I had a thought that I may be developed a nasopharyngeal Herpes zoster infection, on Feb 11 I started  Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times a day. 2. Ibuprofen 400 mg 3 times. 3. Augmentin (stopped after 4 days, on Feb 7).

(Temperatures were in the 80&#39;s)  a feeling of nerve irritation under  the skin that moved from place to place.  unsteadiness on my feet, lack of focus, a basic, total shut down. I curled up in fetal position under a pile of covers for 24 hours. Didn&#39;t fully recovery for 3 days  All simptoms hit me more or less simultaneously within 5 minutes, about 12 hours after 2nd covid shot.  Didn&#39;t seek medical attention, just plowed through it.  I imagined a biological warfare agent would have felt like that. &#34;I thought I was gunna DIE!&#34;

                                                SUMMARY Two weeks after first vaccine: uncontrollable shaking throughout body, followed by chills, then entire body ache and fever.  The first 12 hours were the worst, but after 36 hours all symptoms were gone.   DETAIL The Feb 3, 2021 First vaccine - Phizer Feb 18, 2021      5:00 pm suddenly came down with shaking throughout my body and then chills.        6:00 pm shaking subsided       7:00 pm entire body aches from head to feet      Later in evening - fever throughout body Feb 19, 2021 feeling better, but still muscle and joint pain throughout body.  Some slight fever.  No appetite, but can smell chicken broth.  February 20, 2021 feeling better but tired      10:00 am COVID test at pharmacy.      Noon ate peanut butter and crackers      2:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      6:30 pm ate full Mexican dinner  February 21, 2021 feeling good with a good appetite.  NO SYMPTOMS.       9:30 am breakfast      1:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      1:30 pm lunch REFLECTION: During entire time, no difficulty breathing or coughing.  And the other symptoms came and went in 36 hours.  The symptoms I did have are the same as a bad reaction to the 2nd vaccine.  (my muscle aches are not a reaction to the vaccine).  Yet, my reaction was not immediate, rather it was 2 weeks and 1 day after my first vaccine.  Therefore, do I have COVID, or a bad reaction to my first vaccine? WAITING for COVID test results.  Second vaccination is scheduled for upcoming Friday, February 26.

                                                experiencing a bit of body aches; a little achy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s husband) from the medical information team. A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose (at the age of 67-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pacemaker/defibrillator and 25% of heart function. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose on 28Jan2021 and was experiencing a bit of body aches (since Jan2021) and was taking paracetamol (TYLENOL), no other symptoms. The consumer had a little concern because the patient has a pacemaker/defibrillator. Before he had the defibrillator, his heart rate was over 300 but now it was normal and the patient was monitored. The patient&#39;s doctor recommended everybody to get the vaccine. The consumer had a concern about the second shot because he heard that the dose was stronger than the first dose. The consumer wanted to know if that was true. The consumer wanted to know if the patient would be fine for the second dose. The consumer added that the patient only has 25% of heart function. They have talked to his doctors, his cardiologist about getting the vaccine. All the heart doctors were telling their heart patient to get the vaccine to prevent them from getting COVID. The consumer added that after receiving the first COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was a little achy (Jan2021) like when he has the flu shot (for immunization on an unspecified date.) He was going to get over that. It was not raising his heart rate or anything. The consumer clarified further that the patient was just achy but has done really well. The patient slept good last night. He has a heart monitor in the bedroom and had no problems. The consumer wanted to understand if the second shot was thicker than the first shot and what was the difference between the first and second vaccine. The patient has not recovered from the events.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

Doctor agreed that swelling and arthritic condition was the result of vaccination and advised to take 600 mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours for a week. Have had some relief from this medication. Doctor advised not to take the second vaccination shot.

Patient denies experiencing acid reflux.  Patient reports that the pain was resolved by nitroglycerin.

A 67-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EN6200 , on 17Feb2021 at single dose in arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number ELI283) on 27Jan2021 and had no adverse effect. The patient was wondering if he hold the current record for the number of days consecutive for a person to have adverse reaction to the second vaccine because it was over a week and he could not move out of his bed. That almost killed him. His vision was also blurred. His weight was dropping rather rapidly because he was not able to eat. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Fatigue beginning on Sunday and growing stronger for the next two days. Couldn&#39;t get any energy. Slept 12 hours each night. Grew nauseous w/o vomiting on Monday. Had multiple bouts of diarrhea Monday and Tuesday. Slight headache. Lost eight pounds from no hunger and diarrhea. Grew dehydrated and felt more malaise. Symptoms began to resolve by Tuesday night. Slept another twelve hours. Felt much better by Wednesday, enough so to eat a fast food meal that evening. Today, 1 April I feel normal and took the dogs on a three mile hike.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6203; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) intramuscularly (in the muscle) in right shoulder on 14Mar2021 at age of 67-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen for an unspecified indication, but the reason for taken this drug was &#34;get up and get moving&#34;, the patient took it for many years. Received call from consumer regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine.  He would like to speak with someone about the effects he had and any suggestions Pfizer may have to help him. There was no prescriber for the vaccine. He received the first dose on 14Mar2021 and on 19Mar2021, he started experiencing side effects. He said all 4 people in his household all got the vaccine and all had side effects. The moment the patient was helping his wife he felt like a sharp needle type pain going through the heart side of his chest. They were little ones, but it was uncomfortable. It caused him to panic. He hanged on to it and it went away in a bit. But 2 hours after that, he had chills and crawled in blankets and stayed until the rest of the night. He has not gotten up since 19Mar2021.  He has bone aches and leg and lower back pain aches. He has a headache on 19Mar2021 and started checking temperature on 25Mar2021. The highest was 104 degrees on 25Mar2021 and ever since (Mar2021) then he had 101 degrees or 100 and something. It also reported he began to have fever on 19Mar2021 (pending clarification). He was told to use Tylenol for fever reducer and started taking it. It also reported he has been taking Tylenol for the headache and fever only and it has not been working, it has actually caused him to have a rash on his face and skull causing dandruff and severe itching and bleeding, so he stopped it. He would like to take Ibuprofen and wanted to know if he could.  When he stopped taking Tylenol, his daughter gave him a lotion for face.  Face is clear and only one place is left that is behind his neck on head.  No further details provided for lotion that he put on the rash. He provided information on Tylenol Extra Strength 500 mg each. He took 2 for rash on 2 occasions every 6 hours and then he started only taking 1 because he has not eaten and felt bitterness in stomach and mouth and was uncomfortable (19Mar2021). The Lot is SSA011 and expiration is Oct2024. He has been taking Ibuprofen for many years and only taking one tablet instead of two. He needs to get up and get going and takes it to help him every day. He did not get tested for COVID, but his wife, son and daughter did and they all tested positive after receiving the vaccine. He assumes he has COVID as well since he has the same symptoms and lives in the same household. He would like to know if he can postpone next dose or can he quit.  Will this get better. If he could take Ibuprofen instead of Tylenol. The outcome of events &#34;sharp needle type pain that went through heart side of chest&#34; and &#34;chills&#34; was recovering, of &#34;fever/ highest was 104 degrees&#34;, &#34;bone aches&#34;, and &#34;leg and lower back pain&#34; was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8730), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Mar2021 10:45 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included knee surgery, dislocated shoulder (he has dislocated that shoulder in the past several times but had no recent issues), carpal tunnel syndrome and, rheumatoid arthritis, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. In Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm opposite where he received the injection. He reported he like had a muscle tear that it has an intense excruciating pain. He took three aspirin and put a heating pad on it that didn&#39;t touch it. He then reported that the pain went to his knee and it &#34;got all blow up&#34; and stated that that knee had to be drained. He then stated that the calf on his other leg &#34;got messed up&#34; and was found to have a blood clot as well as fluid on that knee. He reported that it was as stiff as a board and that he could not walk on either of his knees for a couple of days. He reported that he still has problems with the one knee that &#34;blew up&#34; and had to be drained but stated that the inflammation in the calf where blood clot was has receded and is back to normal. He stated that he had to visit the emergency room twice and see an orthopedic surgeon for these issues and has been prescribed Xarelto to take to treat the blood clot. In the morning his leg was stiff. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated on 16Apr2021, blood clot on right leg on 12Apr2021, and pain in groin on 13Apr2021. The pain in his groin went down, but his calf swelled to twice the size and it felt like a horse because he was favoring it. It felt like a muscle cramp. The orthopedic saw him for his left knee and he was seen in the Emergency Room for his right and they called his primary doctor. He tried to work and paid the price with his left knee. He has been taking Tylenol and icing it. The last two days (unspecified date) he has been babying it, the weather has been not so great, so he is laying low and give it a rest, but knows he is supposed to get up and move around so he has been doing that and elevating it. He would like to know if, based on these symptoms he experienced after the vaccine, he should get the second dose of the vaccine, which he states he is supposed to get on Tuesday. The outcome of the events &#34;Right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated&#34;, and &#34;Pain in groin&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

                                                On Tuesday 2-17-21 at a1am in the morning I started getting muscular pains in my body. I was able to breathe easily but when I  inhaled I felt the pain more dramatically. I started 2-16-21  feeling a bit achy but I went for a bicycle ride.  When I retuned home  i was still feeling achy but it was more pronounced in my neck and chest. I called my niece who is a PA and explained my symptoms and she told me to go to the ER to rule out that I was not having a heart attack. Went to Hospital. They took and EKG, Chest X-ray and blood work  and everything came back negative. I went back home and the pain in my chest and neck became progressively worse. Most of the pain was on the right side of my body. I was in a great deal of pain at this point.  I texted my Dr and he suggested I take 600 to 800 milligrams of Ibuprofen which  I did. (600) I was lying down at this point but no matter which way I moved  I was in uncomfortable pain. Approximately  20 minutes after taking the ibuprofen the pain subsided.   2-18-21 I feel better today but still have some slight pain in my neck . I am just relaxing today.

                                                Within an hour of receiving 2nd dose started experiencing headaches and dizziness. In addition to the headaches and severe dizziness I started having significant bouts with diarrhea, malaise, loss of appetite and have not slept well.  Within a couple days I noticed pronounced tremors in my right hand and I started losing weight from 180 pounds to 157, around 23 pound loss.  I contacted my physician and was alerted to make this report and have an appointment on March 1.

                                                After about 3 hours (around noon) I began to feel like I was coming down with a cold and fever. By 4PM I had chills and body aches. By 8 pm I took my temperature and it was a low grade 99.8. Through the remainder of the night the chills worsened to the point where I was shaking uncontrollably and I could not get warm. I was also very dizzy. The next day (2/26/21) was more of the same along with a very painful headache and muscle aches especially in my shoulders and neck. That night all of those symptoms continued along with very sharp stabbing pains in my left leg above the knee cap. The dizziness also continued and I nearly passed out trying to get out of bed early in the morning. My fever had increased to 100.5 at the highest. I was also very weak by the end of the day on 2/26/21. On 2/27/21 I was beginning to feel a bit better but still had that low grade fever (now about 99.8) a headache and I remained very weak. The weakness was especially evident in my legs - it was very hard to stand up. It is now 2/28/21 and I am feeling nearly 100% myself again.   From all I had read and understood I was expecting to have a reaction to the 2nd vaccine. I did not consider any of this life threatening nor necessary to call my PCP. Still, I wanted to report these reactions as it is my understanding the adverse reactions to the 2nd vaccination are common in people much younger than me.

A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 (reported as &#34;yesterday morning&#34;, at the age of 68-year-old male) at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing arthritis, he also took 2 Tylenol for his conditions (arthritis) around 2:30 pm. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. First the patient had no problem, but last night at 11:00 PM he woke up very chilled, shivering, these symptoms lasted for 30 minutes and the went away. Today he&#39;s feeling a light soreness at the injection site, it&#39;s not aching, he also had a quick slight twinge pain near his neck area, however his lymph nodes are not swollen. He has taken his temperature 3 times today, the last one was 100.4(degree)F; he also took 2 Tylenol for his conditions (arthritis) around 2:30pm. He would like to know if fever is one of the side effect how concerned should he be and what should he do. He would like to know if this is something temporary. He has some questions about the risk of receiving the vaccine. He took the first dosage yesterday morning (on 08Feb2021) and then when he came home, he noticed around 11pm, he woke up and noticed he could not get comfortable. He had chills and that lasted for 30 minutes.  Today, he noticed he has been taking his temperature. The last time he took it, it was 100.4 degrees. He has had slight soreness at injection site, not where some people he knows complained about pain all night long.  He just has slight soreness. He did not have any information to provide on the other people that had pain all night long. He did not have any redness or swelling.  He also read about lymph node swelling.  He has a twinge of swelling in his neck and is not sure that is what it is. His fever has not subsided.  He took Tylenol, which he later stated was an over the counter generic Acetaminophen, and he still has a fever. The outcome of the event Chills was recovered on 08Feb2021 23:30; of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Stiff arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 26Jan2021 08:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included hyperactive thyroid, psoriasis, and prostate disorder. Concomitant medications included methimazole (tablet) for hyperactive thyroid, apremilast (OTEZLA, tablet, lot number: 1121523) for psoriasis, and tamsulosin (capsule, lot number: KP7571, expiration date: Apr2022) for his prostate to help him urinate. The patient experienced stiff arm on 27Jan2021. Day 4 after he had the first dose of the vaccine, he has had no side effects. He wants to double check his medications since he is taking three different medications. He wants to check his meds so he will not have adverse effects on the vaccine&#39;s ability to work for him. Outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                Slight headache about 30 minutes after receiving shot at 11 AM, Saturday, 3/6/2021. About 5 hours after shot I started feeling like I was coming down with something, like I had a mild fever and headache was a little more pronounced, but still mild. By 8pm I had fever of 102F, headache was now uncomfortable, so took 2 Tylenol and went to bed. Fever broke about 3-4AM, but still retained a very mild fever of 99F with very mild headache,  muscle aches and joint stiffness/pain for the following day and the day after. By Tuesday 3/9, head was starting to clear and feeling like I had mild fever was gone. Headache was no longer. Each day thereafter, my head seemed to be more cognitive/clearer and looking back, I could tell I was not thinking clearly, with difficulty remembering things. Since I was not working, fogginess had zero impact on my lifestyle. I should note the first shot, received on 2/13/2021, I had no effects at all. Nothing. Since I was not feeling very well during this time, I tended towards comfort foods which elevated my blood sugar, but that returned to normal levels by 3/9/2021.

                                                I am an internal medicine provider and have an 18-year h/o rheumatoid arthritis that had been well-controlled for years allowing me to stop treatment with MTX/leucovorin 3 years ago.   On 2/28/021 I developed pain, erythema, warmth and swelling at the 4th MCP in my L hand which persisted for several days.  I contacted my rheumatologist, and saw him on 03/04.  Since this was my first episode of inflammation in years, we elected to treat it conservatively with naproxen OTC.  My symptoms resolved after several days, but then I had successive episodes of pain, erythema, warmth and swelling in my R 5th MCP, R ankle, L 5th TMT, L 5th MCP, L knee and R wrist over the next 3 weeks--- in the pattern of palindromic rheumatism similar to that my symptoms had first began 18 years ago.  Given the number and severity of these episodes, doctor recommended treatment with prednisone 10mg PO qdaily for 30 days and restarting MTX 15mg (six 2.5mg tabs) PO qweekly  and folate 1mg PO qdaily.

                                                I had no reactions after my first Pfizer injection.  2 Days after my second injection my right calve started to hurt.  This grew increasingly worse each day to where walking was painful.   A week later on Monday,  March 15 my left knee started to hurt and then my left calf.  On Tuesday, March 16 I went to the Hospital Emergency room.  They did a number of tests and one of them was ultrasound of both of my legs.  They found DVTs in both legs and started me on Lovenox injections.   About 5 years ago I had a DVT in my right leg but never had any pain or other adverse symptoms from this DVT.  Also I was taking Xarelto to prevent any further DVTs.  On Saturday, March 20 I went back to the ER because my leg pain was still bad.  They did new leg ultrasounds and the DVTs were gone.  My left knee still hurts and my doctor is trying to find out why.   Anyway none of this may be related to the vaccine, but everyone is curious of why I would get these new DVTs when I was taking Xarelto daily and I had never had a problem for 5 years.  The other odd thing is that i had so much pain when my prevous DVT had no pain symptoms.  So now I am continuing the Lovenox injections and we are trying to determine why my left knee is still in so much pain.  It might be something like arthritis in that knee but it seems like such a coincedence that it happened at the same I got these DVTs and I have no history of joint pain anywhere in my body, not even any back pain.

I could not tolerate even tepid tea, and I was unable to raise my right arm high enough to grasp a car steering wheel.  This lasted, getting worse Sunday, through Monday, and into Tuesday morning.  That afternoon i noticed the discomfort in both areas lessening, and by Wednesday evening, had resumed their baseline sensitivities.

A 68-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 16Apr2021 (at the age of 68-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; also received co-suspect drug: upadacitinib (RINVOQ) via oral on unspecified date at unknown dose, daily for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Medical history included moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. On unspecified date, the patient experienced immunodeficiency (immune system low), tiredness, and joint pain (described as: patient was feeling tired and felt his immune system was low on unspecified date, since he had been doing a lot of travelling and that his joints hurt a little bit in winter). On unspecified date in Apr2021, he broke out with shingles in his scalp and it went down the left side of his head to his neck. Outcome of the events joint pain was recovered on unspecified date; while event shingles recovered on unspecified date in Apr2021. Outcome of the event tiredness was not recovered; while outcome of the event immunodeficiency (immune system low) was unknown. The reporter&#39;s causality for the events (tiredness, joint pain and shingles in scalp and it went down left side of head to neck) with upadacitinib (RINVOQ) was no reasonable possibility; while for the reporter&#39;s causality for the event (immune system low) was not provided.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events (immune system low, tiredness, joint pain and shingles) with the suspect product (BNT162B2) was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  Information on batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The association between the reported events immune system low, tiredness, joint pain, and shingles with BNT162B2 can not be completely excluded. The history of rheumatoid arthritis might be contributory as well.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The pain is centered in the area of the surgeries (L3- L5) There was no discomfort at the injection site after the injection. There was no significant physical activity or strain, and no extraordinary dietary changes prior to the reactions. the injection may not be the cause of pain and diarhea, but some of the possible reactions include &#34;..muscle pain.. and feeling unwell&#34;. My primary concerns are: 1) Will the back pain subside?  It is less now, and I hope it will return to normal in time.  2) Should I take any additional injections of the vaccine?

Symptoms included delayed injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, 99.2 temp, injection site red (delayed and only on 7th day), nausea, feeling unwell, dizziness, weakness, and hives which were relieved with Benedryl.    Most of the symptoms began on Monday, February 8th and worsened on Tuesday, February 9th with hives.  There was no shortness of breath or respiratory issues.  Injection site was only tender on day of injection but tender and red on the 9th only.  Fatigue, headache,  hives continued on February 10th along with a slight bout of diarrhea.  Called clinic and they requested he go in and be tested for Covid-19 and results should be known in 2 days.  February 11th seemed to be better and as of 10:00 a.m. PST no hives but still itching and slight fatigue.  Again,  didn&#39;t know if it could be a reaction since it is a week out or something else.

This severe feeling of sickness was the worst feeling of sickness that I have had in my life, only equal to the most sick I have felt in my life, which was the last time I had the flu, which was almost 43 years ago. This began about 9 hours after I got my second vaccine shot. This lasted about 36 hours, the worst of it about 4 hours. Lab data sars-cov-2 test (unknown date): negative. No treatment received. Events were reported as non-serious. Outcome of the events was recovered.

Mar. 3 (day 14 - day 18): LOWER LEGS / SHINS / ANKLES PAIN AND SORENESS, needed to rub / massage to reduce pain; pain was at a signficant level and several day duration that surprised and even alarmed me; I considered calling my doctor, but assuming it was a temporary symptom caused by the vaccine, so I did not call, did not take more Ibuprofen, and gradually the pain reduced and petered out. I had not read of any such symptom.

Very Erratic and disrupted sleep for Days. The Major Adverse effect is that these Reactions are within the Range of Published and known Effects. I treated them at home with Rest and Some Tylenol, but was not really capable of normal functioning or to be Employed.. But they were Persistent for 6 1/2 Days....   I have spoken to No One who have had the symptoms last this long. It seemed and felt like descriptions  of Real Covid or past Influenzas but the symptoms seemed more severe and longer. I have spoken with many who have had real Covid who&#39;s symptoms and length of illness were milder... I did contact my Physician to advise of this event.

                                                I had 1 episode following the first injection that lasted 4 days. I experienced severe fatigue, muscle and joint pain, body ache, and headache. I then had 2 episodes of the same but more severe symptoms following the second injection. The first lasted 3 or 4 days and began about four days after the second injection. The second occurred beginning March 14th and lasted until the following Friday. The symptoms since then tend to recur the day following being physically active for a  full day but are not as severe and last for less than half the day.  These symptoms are very similar to those I have experienced on a regular basis since undergoing a series of major surgeries approximately 10 years ago.

A 69-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood clots (reported as blood thinner). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 2019 and ongoing as blood thinner. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Feb2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization which gave him severe diarrhea, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, a sore arm and it wore him out. After the second dose of the vaccine on 13Mar2021 which was administered in a public health department, the patient experienced sore arm. He was concerned because around 02:00 on 19Mar2021, he got up to go to the bathroom and noticed his left leg was basically numb and rubbery.  As soon as he tried to stand up, he fell. He thought the second vaccine was the one everyone says will be harder than the first. They even gave him a sheet of paper that scared the hell out of him. Thought he was okay after the second vaccine until around 02:00. At first, he thought his leg had just gone to sleep. It was like having noodles for legs. The patient has been urinating almost non-stop which also started around 02:00, this was what woke him up. He had to crawl on hands and knees after falling to get into the bathroom, he had no strength except a smidgen of strength in the right leg. On 18Mar2021, while eating dinner, he had trouble holding his fork and did not think much about it. He had a cramp feeling in right hand. Today, while eating lunch with a fork, he also had a difficulty. The patient eats with his right hand. The patient has been trying to learn how to walk since early this morning. He has worn out his wife since she was cleaning up after him in the bathroom and helping him walk. He couldn&#39;t walk to the commode very well, couldn&#39;t hold his water, and has been making a mess all day. He was at first afraid he was having a stroke but had no stroke symptoms. The patient reported that his weight was 201, then mentioned that during the night he thought about how much he was urinating and got on the scale out of curiosity and it said he weighs 191. At this time, his leg weakness persists but he was able to stand and hold his own body weight. Issue with holding fork and cramp feeling in right hand was persisting. Urinating was persisting and stated he was going about every 2 hours and goes a lot. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 17Mar2021; unknown for stroke, fall, and weight loss; and not recovered for all other events.

Admission to ER for suspected cardiac event.  Intense pain continues for 4.5 hours despite multiple administrations of fentanyl. ER tests negative for heart attack. CT interpretation does not rule out suspected aortic dissection due to fluid around aneurysm (later ruled out with second CT). Transfer to another Hospital for possible cardiac repair. Surgeon disagrees with CT reading. Three days in ICU and Step Down, CT, Cardiac Echo, Carotid Echo, Chest X Ray, Blood Tests all negative for cardiac event.

                                                Narrative:  Patient seen in ED 1-17-21 with c/c of &#34;bloated with epigastric pain&#34;. Patient with complicated medical history including stage 1B pancreatic cancer (was currently on chemotherapy mFOLFIRINOX), and a leadless permanent pacemaker implantation on 1-11-21 for long episodes of SR with complete heart block following symptoms of syncope (other cardiac history: CAD s/p CABG 2009, PAF, and HTN). Regarding ER visit for epigastric pain, nothing notable was found on workup and patient was to discharge home to rest. There were available doses of COVID-19 Vaccine following a vaccine clinic that same day, and patient was offered and agreed to a dose of vaccine. Patient was monitored for 15 minutes post vaccine with no notable issues. The following day, Monday 1-18-21, patient&#39;s caregiver called facility at 22:30 to report he had a fever of 102.8 degrees and that he had been &#34;feeling kind of bad all day&#34;. Patient was advise to seek urgent medical care and reported back to ED on 1-19-21 at 00:55. Patient wasd admitted for SIRS (tachycardia and febrile) -- patient also reported diffuse myalgia. WBC WNL, CXR unremarkable for infection, UA neg for bacteria, LFTs WNL, blood cultures negative. Procalcitonin elevated at 17.8 -- suggesting inflammatory response. Patient initially reported feeling better on the morning of 1-19-21, but around 13:00 began rapidly declining (confusion, unable to walk) and started experiencing EKG changes (9 beats of SVT). Patient then coded and resuscitation was attempted for approximately 30 minutes. Patient did not survive the code. Coroner has been notified and family is considering autopsy at time of this report.

                                                About 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine I started feeling a stiffness around the injection site. I used an ice pack for about 40 minutes before I had to leave for work. It felt stiff and sore all day and when I returned from work, at about 7:30PM, when I removed my shirt, I saw that it was red, somewhat swollen &amp; felt hard around the area where I was injected.  At 10PM it&#39;s still that way.

The symptoms last for around 12 hours.

                                                None of my health care providers have been able to explain the cause of my sudden loss of vision in my left eye at approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb 2021.  At approx. 3:00 a.m. on 8 Feb I called my ophthalmologist&#39;s answering service and my ophthalmologist called me back shortly thereafter.  She told me I should go to the ER which I did at approx. 4:00 a.m. where blood tests were done, an ultrasound of my left eye, CT scan of my head, and MRI of my head were performed all with negative results.  When my vision was tested at the ER using the standard wall chart, I was unable to see the largest letter on the chart with my left eye.  I saw my ophthalmologist at approx. 1:40 p.m. the same day after my 6 1/2 hour ER visit. I was diagnosed with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.  Both of my eyes were dilated and photos were taken of each eye.  I was given an injection of Avastin in my left eye.  As of today, 12 Feb 2021, I am still functionally blind in my left eye.  I can see general large objects but am unable to see details or read written words either near or far.  Prior to approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb, my vision was as it had been for several years prior with little if any degradation.  I typically have an annual eye exam by my ophthalmologist but due to Covid-19 my last eye exam was 9 Dec 2019 at which time there was nothing to suggest that I would have such loss of sight in either of my eyes.  I am a healthy person who takes no or very little medication when prescribed.  I have never been hospitalized (other than this ER visit) or diagnosed with any significant medical condition.  In late Dec 2020 following routine blood tests, I had a teleconference &#34;physical&#34; with my PCP at which time I was declared to be healthy.  Upon leaving the ER at approx. 10:30 a.m. on 8 Feb my &#34;end of visit vitals&#34; were recorded as blood pressure 110/63, BMI 20.92, weight 150 lbs., height 5&#39;11&#34;, temperature 97.6 F, pulse 67, respiration 16, and oxygen saturation 95%.  Late last year I had my usual flu vaccination without any side effects.  After almost 2 weeks, I do still have a bruise at the Pfizer vaccine injection site on my left arm and I experienced mild muscle soreness the evening after my vaccination and the following morning.  Normally I have no adverse reaction to vaccinations.

Also some neck and shoulder pain. That was around 5:30pm. Took 2 / 200mg ibuprofen (over the counter medication) and did help to relive discomfort. On 02/14/2021 woke up around 8am and most of my joints had mild aches to include neck and shoulder stiffness and pain. Pain both days on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate a 2 or 3. Today 02/15/2021 all symptoms gone.

The next I experienced headache and significant aches in my joints along with a general feeling of being ill as has been been reported.  After my second dose the headaches and joint pains began within a few hours.  I also had significant diaherra that lasted most of the day of the shot and into the next morning.  At first I thought the diaherra may have been from cheese I ate the night before but that has never lasted like this.

It also felt like a nerve was being pinched causing a discomfort down to my ache and foot.  Felt like my foot was trying to go to sleep and tingling. This feeling woke me up about 1 am in the morning ( 2/26) and unable to get comfortable to go back to sleep.  Cause me to limp , unable to put full weight on the leg. This lasted all night and during the day has improved.  It feels somewhat weak, but I can put weight on the leg with a light limp. My foot feels like it has recovered from going to sleep and now has blood flowing, less tingling.

A 70-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 13Jan2021 11:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical histories. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been having side effects such as sharp lower back pain going down his right leg on late thursday (14Jan2021) afternoon, but probably the morning of 15Jan2021, which he never had before. It feels almost like a pinched nerve, but hasn&#39;t done anything to exert himself since he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. He did not cause this pain himself and wanted to know if anybody else has reported this. Outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Then about 4 days later he was going for a 2 mile walk and started out on the walk and had not done a 1/4 of a mile and he started to feel warm.  He had pain in his trapezius muscles into his neck, had a headache and had a bad pain in the pit of his stomach, joint pain in his knees and started to get vasovagal event, everything looked bright and the white things seemed to glow.  He then walked back to his vehicle slowly.  Since then every time he does anything exertionally, walking for any short distance the same symptoms seem to come on.  He also has a tired feeling.  He called his cardiologist and he suggested that he should try drinking a lot of water to hydrate himself.  His brother-in-law is a paramedic who also told him to hydrate before his vaccine.   He&#39;s been drinking a lot of water.  He does have a stomach issue, and has been having the nausea but believes that was preexistent to the vaccine.  He has not had any reactions around the injection site itself.  He did have some soreness in the arm for a couple of days initially, but had also gotten a regular flu vaccine through the hospital and had the same reaction with that.

                                                After my first vaccine (EK5730--on 12/26/20), I had absolutely NO reactions. The second one was quite a different matter.   14 hours after the shot, I developed shaking chills. The next day I had myalgias and arthralgias pretty much all over. It was that &#34;run over by a truck&#34; feeling of the flu. Headache, fatigue followed. Appetite was down. No fever.   Slept for many hours.   Now in my third day after the vaccine and not feeling better.   Still, I remain grateful that I was immunized and am taking the optimistic spin that this kind of intense reaction shows my immune system is responding strongly and nicely to the vaccine.  It is miserable though, particularly since the first one was so benign.   I am a family doctor (MD) and am torn between discussing this in my weekly health column which may dissuade patients, some already on the fence, from getting vaccinated. I saw the FDA info confirming higher incidence of side effects with second shot, which was definitely the case with me.

                                                Three to four days after the injection I began to feel muscle and joint aches in my entire body along with fatigue. These symptoms grew in intensity and lasted about seven days, then suddenly diminished and then stopped.  Dates: (1) January 8, 2021: injection; (2)  January 11 - 13: beginning of symptoms; (3) January 16-17: lessening of symptoms; (4) January 18: disappearance of symptoms.   I also experienced soreness in my left arm at the site of the injection.  That began several hours after the injection and was much more intense than the soreness I usually experience with flu shots.  The soreness lasted about 24 hours, again much longer than my experience with flu shorts.  It then suddenly diminished and then stopped--same pattern as the aches and fatigue described above.

It progressed to hurt considerably by the time to go to bed that I had to support my head with a towel around my neck.  I took a Flurbiprofen 100mg before going to bed and I had the my neck massaged with Aspercream.   I sleep on the sides and moving from one side to the other I had to support my head with my hands. This morning (Jan. 28) the pain went a little down, but looking to the sides was painful. Around noon I took another Flurbiprofen. Tomorrow? Will see.  Now, in the evening, the pain slightly increase again and spreading toward the shoulder blades and  lower on the spine.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes (controlled by food not by injection), coronary artery spasm (blood vessels that occasionally collapsed), glaucoma, and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included albuterol for asthma, atorvastatin (LIPITOR), glyceryl trinitrate (NITROGLYCERIN) for coronary artery spasm, and numbers of eye drops (unspecified) for glaucoma. The patient had taken the COVID-19 vaccine just not too long ago and had good number of non-serious side effects. The patient was not really concerned with these side effects that she had. On 13Jan2021, the patient had the little bit of pain from the injection site but that&#39;s common with any injection, so he did not count it, but next day the events started, and he still had some, but they were subsiding. The next events happened the next day after administration (14Jan2021). The patient had the injection site pain and the arm is still weak, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, nausea, and feeling unwell on 14Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the events.

That evening, about 36 hours after getting the shot, my right knee swelled up and hurt alot.  The next morning I could barely walk, with much pain.  I called a pharmacist and they said I could take Motrin for pain, which I did.

The intensity was severe enough to prevent sleeping for over eight hours. This was accompanied by chills alternating with feeling hot without a measured fever. Six hours after the onset of pain two 500 mg acetaminophen were taken with some blunting of the pain though minimal improvement. After the initial eight hours the pain in in the joints and muscles subsided over about four hours. The headache that was akin to migraines in the past persisted for another six hours and was eventually relieved by two doses of ibuprofen 600 mg six hours apart.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3302), intramuscular on 22Jan2021 15:10 at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml by intramuscular injection left shoulder) for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure (diagnosed about 21 years ago), ongoing gout (Diagnosed about 2 years ag), ongoing ankle spur right foot, ongoing diminished cartilage both knees, joint pain. The concomitant medications included torsemide. The patient reported adverse event (AE) after his first Pfizer-Biontech covid19 vaccine at 15:10  on 22Jan2021. He reported arm pain starting 3 hours after vaccination until noon the next day (23Jan2021). When he woke up on 23Jan2021 he reported lower back pain, that has migrated more to the right hip and into the glute. The pain inhibits walking, standing, etc. He did note that he is &gt;300lbs and has had joint pain in the past, but the hip pain is new. He also thought it might be kidney pain, as he takes a daily diuretic. He stated he has been treating with Aleve twice a day, but that walking is still very bad.  The patient is an optometrist that was calling about the Covid-19 vaccine and said that he did not know if the Lot number written on the vaccination card is EL3302, E13302, or EI3302. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and reported that he got a sore arm about 3 hours after receiving the injection. He woke up with a sore lower back pain. He is 5ft 9.5 and 310 lbs and he is on Torsemide, a pretty strong diuretic. He woke up with the back pain and stated that it moved right and middle to his buttocks, a little lower than the end of his spine and to the right. He did not think it was his kidneys. He said that Torsemide can make kidneys work overtime. His knees were pretty shot, the left worse than the right. No further details provided. He was upset to know that he has shrunk a 1.5 inches over the years. He has been taking 2 Aleve a day since Saturday, this morning was his 4th pill. He said that it is really odd when he stands equally on both feet his lower back hurts. He has to sleep on his right side and that it hurts more when he sleeps on his back and on his left side. He was fearful doing eye exams next to his patient and how the lower back pain would affect him.  Reporter considered seriousness for Lower back pain was Medically significant. The outcome of event lower back pain was not recovered; of event arm pain was recovered on 23Jan2021; of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event low back pain cannot be excluded. The ongoing gout and concomitant drug torsemide may also play contributory roles to the event.

                                                On Monday night, after the vaccination on Friday, about 10:00 I began to feel pain in my neck, both shoulders, and across my chest. Sleep was fitful and finally impossible, with every breath being painful. We went to ER about 6:00 A.M., thinking it was either a heart attack or COVID. I was checked very well, with good results. EKG was fine, Oxygen at 97%, chest x-ray looked good, white blood count was good, but platelets were low. A subsequent flu test and COVID test both came back negative. My symptoms were constant for several hours then diminished, increased, and diminished until Friday when I felt largely symptom free.

Over the next two days that pain migrated to my right buttock and radiated down my right leg.  With full weight applied to my right leg the leg had weakness and would occasionally buckle.  I am due for my second injection but am considering not taking the second injection fearing permanent nerve involvement.  As of today 2/23 the pain in my right leg and buttocks is lessened but still present.

I think I am supposed to notify my doctor and you guys will generate a report to the government. Here are the circumstances: I received the vaccine on 02/10/21. It was Pfizer Lot Number EN5318. I got severe abdominal pain (lower left side below rib cage) four days later. I also had very bad lower back muscle pain (left side at waistline). This lasted all day. On day 2 the pain was down by about half and the back pain was gone. On day 3 I had only slight abdominal pain. It was completely gone by day 4.

                                                About 8 hours after injection, I began having pain on right side of back just under ribs. Pain worsened through night, causing difficult sleep. On evening of second day, pain spread to right flank and right front of abdomen, causing entire right side of abdomen to experience significant pain. It is possible this is muscular pain, but after reading the Internet, I believe it is inflammation of the gallbladder. I have never before experienced gallbladder issues. The pain is much worse than the &#34;muscle aches&#34; described as a COVID vaccine side effect. There is no fever or other significant symptoms. Today (third day) I emailed my doctor. His nurse responded that it is hard to tell if it is vaccine related, and that if it begins to resolve not to be concerned about it, but if it gets worse I should be seen by the doctor. I am taking Tylenol and applying Voltarin topically, but neither helps much.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

The symptoms lasted about 12 hours, but decreasing gradually after 8 hours. - Eleven days after the second dose: While the dry cough has not gone away, in the evening of this 11th day, I began to experience 100.9 degree fever, extreme lower back and back-of-the leg pain, mild diarrhea, mild headaches, a red rash that started on the left torso and, over the course of 12 hours, kept spreading, eventually covering the entire body from head to toe.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

This morning the pain has dropped to my right buttock and is radiating down my right leg; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 71-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9264) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Feb2021 (at the age of 71-years-old), for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were no concomitant medications and no other vaccine was administered on the same date. Exactly one week after the injection, on 17Feb2021, the patient began having routine symptoms including weakness, tiredness, and chills. The unusual and unexpected symptom was a right flank pain that seemed to be over the right kidney. According to the patient, it seemed to be muscular, so he dismissed it. On the morning of 21Feb2021, the pain had dropped to his right buttock and was radiating down his right leg. The patient also reported a weakness in his right leg and that his right leg had buckled a couple times this morning (21Feb2021). The patient did not receive treatment for weakness, tiredness, chills, right flank pain, muscular (pain), pain had dropped to his right buttock and was radiating down right leg, weakness in right leg, and right leg had buckled. The clinical outcome of weakness, tiredness, chills, right flank pain, muscular (pain), pain had dropped to his right buttock and was radiating down right leg, weakness in right leg, and right leg had buckled was not recovered.

A 71-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EN6203; Expiration Date: Jun2021) dose 2 via an unspecified route of admin-istration on 07Mar2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included diabetes mellitus; he does not take medication for it. It was controlled by diet and exercise, high blood pressure, high lipids, herpes zoster from Oct2019, bell&#39;s palsy from Oct2019, herpes zoster oticus from Oct2019, paralysis, vertigo, ear disorder, paraesthesia oral and his tongue was tingly. Concomitant medications included alprazolam taken for sleep disorder, simvastatin taken for lipids increased, alprazolam (XANAX) taken for sleep disorder.  The patient had his second shot last sunday and had a discussion had with his doctor&#39;s nurse this morning that centered around people taking the Moderna and had some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or some-thing like that and he wanted to call about what had happened. He has had overlapping stuff from cer-vical stenosis that manifests on the left side on his shoulder arm and hands and also about a year and half ago Oct2019 he had shingles in his ear and mouth on the left side of face. He had Bell&#39;s palsy and Ramsey Hunt syndrome number 2. He had paralysis, droopy mouth, eye wouldn&#39;t close, vertigo, ear issues, hearing drop and that recovered which was weird. He went to physical therapy until early last year before COVID then he was steered away from that. About 10 months ago some of the symptoms came back in a odd way. His eye had the feeling like it couldn&#39;t close. His eyelids had at night the muscles in his face on the left side face felt taut. The inside of his gum felt like his skin was thicker, he was not sure it was the sensation and that never went away. With the shingles he had an issue where down the side of his tongue was tingly, these things overlap and it was either very little or really an-noying. In last 10 months it had got quite a bit better until about 5-6 weeks ago it was back to where it was, it was just annoying on and off. Then he got the shot sunday, and it was weird at first, he was writing it off as both stress and relief and other things. He was not dizzy and that evening the left side of his mouth went bonkers, it wound up being like when the shingles were acting up on the inside of his mouth it felt tingly and weird, and it was confined to the left half of his face and nothing else. He did not have droopiness or any Bell&#39;s palsy kind of thing had gone away the Ramsey-Hunt syndrome, he says it was a series of things and he has number 2, he does not know what the other ones are, but it was something that comes along with the chicken pox or the herpes zoster virus. The stenosis, the cervical stenosis, the left is the main problem, but the right was not far behind with regard to nerve compression, the right does not bother him as much in the way of tingling and numbness. The weird thing is he had his hands sitting in his lap and he moved his thumb towards his forefinger, there was a couple inches between and it felt like there was a rubber band pulling his thumb back, it happened 2-3 times he was fooling around with it and it went away, the sensation was still there a little in the back ground, the rest of him the right side of him was fine and today is a lot better like he said things over lap so he is not saying anything has anything to do with the vaccine but he is operating under the as-sumption that if Moderna patients are having some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or something similar, if he has left over inflammation and in Nov2019, he had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), when he first got sick and then he had another one done and his neurologist said on an unspecified date in Aug that he still sees some nerve inflammation particularly down jaw line, he saw inflammation from 2019 to 2020 he still seen inflammation and the upper part of his eye, the brow seems to behave as if there may be some inflammation running through it. His hand on the right is not doing the thing is his left thumb, it is being weird and the thing sunday night with his mouth. He thinks the whole idea is that the vaccine wakes up the immune system and gets it to recognize the RNA for COVID and generate anti-bodies and if it is acting like inflammation gets the body&#39;s attention, he is not a biologist but maybe it also caught on to his nerve inflammation and took a look at his nerves and cause them to bounce around and have other things occur that were more intense and he was trying to report to let some-one know that the underlying things left over from his shingles, he does not know about the rest of it because sleeping wrong could affect his neck shoulders and arms, he was not sure if it could be an is-sue with the vaccine, there was no clear definite thing, but the thing sunday night with his mouth was definitely far more, he thought this was the way he felt in his mouth a couple weeks after he got the shingles diagnosis like he had hives on inside of his cheek and tongue, it was crazy with extra salivation but he did not have the hives. The last time he got a vaccine it was the Shingrix it was probably too late last year, he got pretty sick off of it with flu like symptoms but he doesn&#39;t ever want another run in with shingles. It was his second COVID 19 vaccine he got 07Mar and it was the same day that the thing with his mouth happened and that was the most noticeable aspect of it, if he had not had the vaccine he would be sitting here right now just thinking he was having a bad day it runs down the left side of his tongue and stops smack in middle of the front of it. It jumps over sometimes but he was not sure if the nerve endings go on both sides of the tip of tongue or not. It has improved since sunday there was a span there where it was pretty annoying and he commented that he feels like it did when he first had shingles and over a period of time when he went to bed, whenever that was, it abated a bit. His second dose was EN6203 and it is dated Jun2021. The patient was sure they were trained to draw up the exact correct amount in there but he did not ask to look at it, it did not even occur to him. The only other thing is he was diabetic, he takes no medications for that it was diet and exercise controlled both of which COVID has been horrible for, his weight has gone up because they have a tough climate there, it has been cold for 2.5 months. It was finally starting to get a little better but the primary things he would have would be blood pressure, he takes medication for and the same for lipids he takes Simvastatin for that, the things many males his age are taking medication for. He also takes Alprazolam and Xanax to get to sleep at night, because his brain doesn&#39;t want to shut off, cost of being an engi-neer. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, the thing never changed since, it never showed up anywhere else. he does not know if that disappears but he never ended up getting it again. Apparently it shows up frequently in lungs but it did not with him. Those 2 things would be the top of the list type of things for him. He has never had cancer or blood disease, he had mononucleosis in college. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerized tomogram there was nothing left on. He had one case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, magnetic res-onance imaging was an unknown results on Nov2019. He first got sick and then he had another one done , x-ray: there was nothing left on an unknown date. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncov-ered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

It is like a spongy node, it is like a ball of water and it is not at the injection site. It is on my elbow it just showed up. So, it is a side effect that I am reporting. I called the health department and they told me to call my physician. I called my physician, he told me to call my health department. You know, I got frustrated. I saw this number, I am calling you guys to report the side effect. It does not hurt and no pain. It is just a blob on my elbow.&#34; The patient did not receive treatment for the event. The outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                On February 11, 2021 my left arm and hand and shoulder began hurting. the next day my arm experienced constant tingling pain and into my  left hand.  I went to the Primary doctor, and he prescribed several pain killers to combat the pain, didn&#39;t help much , then went to the ER because I thought something happened. Had an MRI , which diagnosed I have pinched nerve in my spinal column in three places. Several doctors don&#39;t think this is related to the Covid shot, but maybe  a coincidence. As of today I am still taking nerve pain killers.

Further, it gave me a bad headache. i was so uncomfortable I got very little sleep that night. It continues into the following day and didn&#39;t begin to subside until about 4:00 pm. The pain in my left shoulder and arm continued off and on until today, 03/19/2021, and was at it&#39;s worst when laying down and first thing in the morning upon waking up.

He suddenly, out of nowhere, got a terrible, terrible pain in the middle of his stomach, it doubles him over, and he broke out in sweats and this was Saturday, 27Feb2021, in the morning. The sweating went away but the pain continued and continued. He went to urgent care on 27Feb2021 they thought he was constipated and was treated for constipation. The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn&#39;t been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don&#39;t know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband&#39;s nurse. When querying weight caller states he&#39;s lost 10 pounds, he&#39;s 142 pounds if he&#39;s lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn&#39;t feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t help the pain. He was also given a &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, asked caller what was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don&#39;t look at the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; it&#39;s kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those &#34;codone&#34; medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband&#39;s and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband&#39;s sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn&#39;t said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn&#39;t think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn&#39;t a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There&#39;s more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he&#39;s there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn&#39;t get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible terrible stomach pain and bug in his colon. Events terrible terrible stomach pain, bug in his colon, broke out in sweats, feeling warm was recovering, event vomiting 5 times was recovered on 27Feb2021, event nausea was recovered on 01Mar2021, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021253476 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021253512 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient

ER or Hip Surgeon can find no reason, tell me I?ve strained my hip somehow. I?m at 2 weeks now, and can still not walk without severe pain and a walker. Wish I had never got the vaccine, and definitely won?t get the second vaccination!!!

About 6.5 days afterward on 03-18-2021, I started having some tingling in my chest area, shoulders, arms, hands, and fingers.  It progressed to a feeling of low oxygen in muscles in the areas described before.  I did not have any problems with breathing, no temperature, and high levels of oxygen saturation (95% to 100%).  On the 23rd, I got the Covid-19 test.  The results were sent to me on the 24th.  The results were negative.  Since then, the low oxygen feeling continues with the addition of the lung muscles. I still have no temperature, and high levels of oxygen saturation (95% to 100%).  The lungs still seem to exchange oxygen well, no congestion.  I will be getting the second dose this Saturday, 04-03-2021.

The caller&#39;s wife explained that the pain was so intense it was causing him to be close to screaming because he cant use it, and that is not like him. He explained that he is hoping it will get better soon. It was worse at night, it started out ok in the morning but as the day progresses it build up. Caller asked how long will this last. Caller received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Dose 1 last Thursday, 4FEB2021 and is scheduled for their Dose 2 on 25FEB2021.

AE(s) did not require a visit to Emergency Room/Physician Office. Relevant Tests was none. No Investigation Assessment. Outcome of the event malaise was recovered on 05Feb2021 and other events was not recovered.

Medical history included COVID-19 prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in Feb2021 (at the age of 72-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. For the past 10 weeks, since the second dose of vaccination, the muscle pain and weakness had worsened to the point of near immobility. It took both hands to lift a half full coffee cup, and patient could barely manage that. Patient could not raise his arms above shoulder height, his knees and other joints did not want to bend, and he was in constant pain. Patient had had to receive five (5) steroid shots in an attempt to counteract this, and the doctor had stated he could receive no more. Patient contacted his doctor&#39;s office and local health department, but neither could help me. Patient was healthy and had no such issues before the shot, and now he was in the worst condition of my life. All these events with start date 09Mar2021, resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, and received treatment Steroid Shots. Since the vaccination, patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I have a history of previous parox. at. fibrillation but none for the last year.  A few hours after 2nd covid injection, along with  mild myalgias/prodromal sx., I went into atrial fib., with mild tach. but no other problems.  The arrythmia persisted for ~24 hr.s then converted back to sinus rhythm-- and fine since.  This event is more of an interesting observation than an &#34;adverse event&#34; but as the spike protein binds to ACE2 receptors, I thought the two events might be related and possibly of interest to you.

                                                I HAD MY FIRST VACCINE ON 6 FEB 2021 AT FACILITY ABOUT 6:00PM.   THAT WAS ON A SATURDAY.  ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY, I HAD A PAIN IN MY LEFT ARM FROM THE INJECTION SITE DOWN THRU MY ELBOW JOINT AND CONTINUING ON TO MY LEFT WRIST.  I HAVE HAD THE PAIN EVER SINCE.  I DID NOT REALIZE THAT TIREDNESS, MUSCLE PAIN, JOINT PAIN AND FEELING UNWELL ALONG WITH DIZZINESS AND WEAKNESS  WERE SYMPTOMS OF A POSSIBLE REACTION TO THE VACCINE. SOME OF THESE SYMPTOMS COULD BE FROM A PREVIOUS STROKE.

Three days following the first dose, I started to experience hematuria as well as constipation. It has happened before as a result of radiation treatment back in 2005/2006. Saw my urologist on 02/02/2021, and  had several tests, ruling out any return of cancer. Antibiotics improved the situation, which was getting closer to normal prior to getting the second dose. Again, three days following the second dose, hematuria returned and still prevails at various degrees. Also experience fatigue and weight loss.

A 73-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL1284), intramuscularly on the left arm, on 12Jan2021 14:00, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient and his wife went to the local senior citizen center on 12Jan2021 to get the vaccine. After which the patient noticed a slight dizziness on 12Jan2021 which was minimal, and the dizziness was something that was normal for him. The dizziness started within 15 minutes time frame after receiving the vaccine. The dizziness occurred when he stood up to leave on 12Jan2021; now the dizziness has recovered. He stated he had dizziness and it went away and possibly occurred because he got up too quick. He also felt a little woozy on 12Jan2021 and it was under control. The next day, on 13Jan2021, after receiving the vaccine he experienced fever, headache, almost flu-like symptoms, and stiffness of his body. His fever went up to 101, 101.8, 101.9 that night of 13Jan2021; earlier in the afternoon of 13Jan2021 around 15:00, he noticed a weirdness as he had a tightness in his head and then discovered he had a fever.

He also had a covid test that was negative on 21Jan2021. He then added that he also had a negative covid test on 18Jan2021; it was not the rapid test but a test that started with a &#34;p&#34;. With these, his primary care provider was very much concerned, and he had a battery of tests done then he was discovered to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) on 22Jan2021. He informed that his primary care provider asked him to go into the office since the primary care provider was convinced that it was something more than just a reaction to the Pfizer covid vaccine. He had more tests on 22Jan2021 and that was when he was diagnosed with a UTI. It was a minimal UTI, not of any consequence, that when the doctor pushed on his bladder it hurt on 22Jan2021. He then received an intravenous antibiotic in the emergency room for the UTI but confirmed that he was not admitted. He stated that he has never had a reaction to any medication he has taken before. He then asked if he should get the second dose, the &#34;booster&#34; of the covid vaccine. He admitted he was quite reluctant to get the second dose that was scheduled for 02Feb2021 and his primary care provider advised against getting the second dose. The outcome of the event dizziness/woozy and dizziness occurred when he stood up to leave/had dizziness and it went away and possibly occurred because he got up too quick was recovered on 12Jan2021. The outcome of the event fever was recovered on 21Jan2021. The patient was recovering from UTI.

When he woke up again at 7 or 8 AM his right leg felt weaker.  He noticed balance issues, gait issues and bladder urgency more than usual.  He walked with difficulty using a cane and went to the ER.  He realized in the hospital that he had difficulty with writing due to coordination issues in the right upper extremity with some weakness.  He was having a lot of right leg spasms.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Dec2020 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He was an ER doctor and the medical director of his hospital. The patient was asymptomatic when he got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. 3 hours after the vaccine he began to get chills, HA, anorexia, myalgias, and extreme fatigue. This worsened and he slept all and had no appetite. On 19Dec2020 he woke up delirious with a fever and was ataxic, hypoxic, incontinent, and confused. The patient was hospitalized due to the events on 15Dec2020. The events also caused prolonged hospitalization due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID via nasal swab post vaccination with unknown results. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as the patient required oxygen, plasma, and remdisivir.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, BNT162B2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of reported serious events might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  Fever, chills, headache, fatigue and muscle pain are the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  More information such as detailed underlying medical conditions and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The next morning I felt chills, really cold, my arm never hurt at all. I was freezing. I had no energy. Very lethargic, with a blanket around me. Never had a fever. All of a sudden, around 2:30PM all dissipated, it was all gone and I was fine. A week later I called my PCP because the symptoms came back - the lethargy. He suggested me to go to the ER. I went and could barely write my name on the sign in sheet at the hospital. They did 5 COVID tests and 4 of them were negative. I was at the ER for 3 days and finally was admitted and stayed for 11 days.  I was sent home with oxygen and my levels are finally getting back to 92/93.  I can&#39;t walk at this time. I lost 17 lbs and if I try to walk my lungs shut down. ( I went to the ER n 01/07 and was discharged on the 17th - I was also at the ER the week before when they tested me and it kept coming back negative) My pulmonary MD

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown.

An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued. The reporter stated she thought it was important to notify Pfizer of her husband&#39;s passing because his side effects fell within the expected time period after receiving his second COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death

My shoulder where the shot occurred became painful and a pinkish rash formed there.  The temp rose to 3.5 degrees over the next seven hours and remained that high until mid morning Saturday.  Then it oscillated between 1.0 and 3.0 degrees until Sunday morning.  Finally it began to fall and reached normal Sunday afternoon around 4 pm.  The rash disappeared on Monday and the shoulder pain stopped on Tuesday.

Eleven days later,  chest pain returns but pain radiates up back into neck and head.  Took 2 Tylenol and went to bed.   Pain subsides.  Next 3 days pain repeats from chest to  head.  Fourth day I start to shiver internally.  This lasted about 75 minutes before going away..  Next day went to ER.  All ER tests were negative and was released.  Went to cardiologist and had a stress test and several other tests that were all normal.   A week later, I thought I was having a heart attack and went back to ER.  All tests were negative again.  Still wake up with neck pain  alleviated with Tylenol..

It has been 3 weeks already and he still has floaters and it has not changed. Second shot was scheduled for 19Mar2021. Two weeks after first and a week before second one, he decided he did not want to get second shot. Fatigue got better 7 days after. Taste and smell took longer to return but came back since then. He takes regular medications for high blood pressure and did not feel they were relevant. Headache comes and goes but improved. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. No previous history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No ER or physician&#39;s office required. The outcome of the event &#39;black floaters in right eye&#39; was not recovered and outcome of the other events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                his legs were extremely weak; has to hold onto something to go through the house; rash is across his upper back, chest, and down both arms; Patient had a dry cough; running a fever; the next morning and it was even worse; flu-like symptoms after both doses; Sore all Over/Achy all over; This is a spontaneous report based on information received by Pfizer from Biontech [manufacturer control number: 40968], license party for Comirnaty. A contactable consumer reported that a 74-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162b2(COMIRNATY, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207, Expiration: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 19Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history includes Arthritis (arthritis is in his right foot only and his big toe, diagnosed in 2017 or 2018) and Concomitant medication were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY) on 26Feb2021 for Covid-19 immunisation and Unspecified steroid shot. Stated reaction was three to four days. First shot got caller and patient down for a week. Second shot got caller down for three days. At first, patient&#39;s reaction was running like hers. Patient had a dry cough on an unspecified date in 2021. Was going for a COVID test today. Last week patient started running a fever on an unspecified date in 2021 and his legs were extremely weak on 14Apr2021. Has to hold onto something to go through the house on 14Apr2021. He was moving a little better, but not much. Patient had to go to doctor for his foot. Has terrible arthritis in the big toe on his right foot. Gets steroid shot every three months. Three weeks and four days after second COVID shot everything seemed to have worn off. The PA put the shot in his foot and it bruised the patient. Patient still has bruises on an unspecified date in 2021. Got the steroid shot in his big toe and two days later the weakness hit a second time. It really wiped him out. Caller cannot help patient get up and down. Patient was struggling with his legs and was aching. Wants to know if a steroid shot on top of the COVID shot and that close after would cause another reaction? The PA said it was ok to get a steroid shot three weeks after. Patient started having these reactions and doesn&#39;t know if it was the COVID shot. Has had steroid shots every 3 months for 4 years. Has never had this kind of reaction. Patient didn&#39;t think about getting the steroid shot because he seemed to be feeling fine. Reaction started the next morning and it was even worse on an unspecified date in 2021. By the third day after the shot he was down and caller couldn&#39;t help patient get up. It scared the caller. Patient also broke out in a rash across his shoulders and down both arms. States her husband has had both shots and he has been having issues since the second one n 19MAR2021. Reporter states 3 weeks and 4 days after the second vaccine, her husband had to have a steroid shot in his foot because he has terrible arthritis in his right foot. Reporter states the patient has had a flare up since then with weakness in his legs and a rash on his chest. States the only difference this time is that he had just had the second Covid vaccine 3 weeks prior. States he has not had steroid reactions in the past, and she feels like this reaction was because of the Covid vaccine. Clarifies the shot in his foot was on 13Apr2021 and she does not know what steroid was injected. States it was 3weeks and 4 days between the steroid injection and the vaccine. States maybe they should war people not to get a steroid shot for a longer time after the vaccine. States after the first vaccine for about 5 days they were just laid out. States they ate soup and whatever they could warm up in the microwave. States his ear doctor said if they reacted to the first shot they must have had Covid at sometimes. States she doesn&#39;t know, they never got tested before but they didn&#39;t have any symptoms. States her husband&#39;s test yesterday was negative. Weakness in the Legs AE: States for the last 2 days, he could not even get up on his own and she can&#39;t lift him because he was bigger than she was. Rash was states it was not itching or anything, just a rash. States it was odd because she has had hives, and this was just broken out. Clarifies the rash was across his upper back, chest, and down both arms on 14Apr2021. States it was kind of like speckled on his body like the measles on an unspecified date in 2021. States the patient was 74 years old and he had measles when he was a kid just like she did, so it is not the measles. States the patient had a Covid 19 test done yesterday and it came back negative, so he doesn&#39;t have Covid. She doesn&#39;t know what it was. Treatment: states he was taking Motrin for the Aching. States she does not know if the reaction was because the PA did the injection, it had always been the doctor that had given the injection. Caller states she thinks it was getting the steroid injection on top of receiving the Covid shot. States the both received their vaccines because they couldn&#39;t get a shot because they weren&#39;t giving shots at her age, so when offered them the vaccine, they jumped on it. Yes, last Monday to his Nurse Practitioner, did not address the weakness in his legs because did not know what to do for that. She did not even say what she thought it was, said he needed to see someone about that but does not know who to see, does not know whether to go to the ER or who to go to. Not that emergent but when doctor does not know what to treat with worrisome. She was calling about to finish the report and to speak with the Medical department regarding if this has been reported before or if any information on the Covid vaccine and steroid injections. He received the 1st dose on 26Feb2021 and the 2nd dose on 19Mar2021. She mentioned that both of them experienced achiness, sore all over after the 1st dose and flu-like symptoms on an unspecified date in 2021 after both doses. Her husband however, had muscle weakness on his legs after the 2nd dose. On 13Apr2021, about 3 weeks and 4 days after the 2nd dose, her husband received a steroid shot on his right foot. They noticed that the weakness on his legs became extreme, to which he had trouble standing up and has to hold on to something to stand up as he cannot support himself. He also had a rash on his trunk, back, and down his arms. She mentioned that the rash was not itchy but was speckled like measles. They were wondering if this has been reported and if it was possibly an interaction between the vaccine and steroid. They mentioned that they already consulted with their HCP but said that they really cannot tell. Outcome of his legs were extremely weak, has to hold onto something to go through the house was not recovered while with other event rash is across his upper back, chest, and down both arms, Achy all over was recovered on 22Mar2021 and flu-like symptoms after both doses and Sore all Over was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021, while with other events was unknown.  Follow up attempts were needed. Further information is expected.

By 3:00 p.m. That day he had soreness at the injection site and by 10:00 p.m. he noticed difficulty using his arms to the transfer.  There was particular difficulty with the proximal left upper extremity and bracing himself and he fell to the floor.  He feels that both arms are weaker since the injection.  He had some pain in the arms particularly at the injection site initially but that has resolved.  He had dry mouth up until February 2nd.  By February 2nd he could start to transfer a bit better from a chair to his driver seat in the van.  He is still not back to his baseline function.

                                                On 2/11, I awoke feeling some pain in my lower abdomen and left groin when I walked. I had no pain when sitting or lying down. As the day progressed, the pain worsened. On 2/12, I began to be concerned that I had somehow damaged the repair of my left side hernia. So that afternoon I went to urgent care to have it checked. The hernia repairs on both sides were totally intact and the doctor did not speculate on what else it could be but said to watch it and if it worsened, to go to the ER. Into that evening, the pain shifted to the right groin. By the morning of 2/13 the pain had greatly diminished but had shifted again to the left groin. On the morning of 2/14, the pain disappeared.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 11:10 AM  (at the age of 75 years), as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included kidney transplant. Concomitant medication included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MYCOPHENOLATE), prednisone. Historical vaccine included Dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL8982), on 14Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization). On 05Feb2021 at around 18:00 PM, the patient had what he believed was an anaphylactic reaction with tightness around his jaw area, ears, and throat, and tightness in upper chest (he clarified that upper chest as where the neck meets the chest. It may have been a little lower, but not that far down that he would have worried. It was the upper chest where the neck meets the chest. Not in the chest to the left or right). It lasted intermittently for 4 days. He reported that it was not continuous, it would come for 2-3 hours dissipate and then come again. It wasn&#39;t all day and all night. He reported &#34;I&#39;m better now&#34;. The clinical outcome of anaphylactic reaction with tightness around his jaw area, ears, and throat, and tightness in upper chest  was recovered on 10Feb2021.

                                                On March 15 I started experiencing pain in both hips as I was walking.  This pain continued and a few days later I started to experience pain in my lower back in addition to the pain in my hips.  It was very hard to walk and if I went too far or long I had to stop and wait for the pain to lessen.  The pain had lessened but is still present.  on about March 20/21 I noticed a blister on the index finger of my right hand.  A rash showed up on my left arm in the area of my wrist on March 23.  It is now March 25 and the rash all over my whole body.  It itches and at times is painful.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 02Mar2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 75-years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dizziness, hyperuricemia (he produces too much uric acid and it causes kidney stones), back pain, COVID-19 in Dec2020 and was cleared by the end of Dec2020. Ongoing concomitant medications included diazepam for dizziness since 1978, allopurinol for hyperuricemia, oxycodone hydrochloride/paracetamol (PERCOCET) for back pain since 7-8 years ago. There were no other vaccines administered on the same day or within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9262) on 09Feb2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 75-years-old) in the left arm and experienced muscle aches. On 02Mar2021 at 21:00, the patient experienced severe shivers. On 03Mar2021 at 02:30, the patient woke up to go to the bathroom and noticed his legs were weak. On 03Mar2021 at 07:00 he was paralyzed in his arms and legs- he could feel his muscles but couldn&#39;t make them move. He just laid there for ten hours, and it was scary, and he thought that over a period of time the vaccine would get filtered out. After that, he was fully recovered and able to move. The events did not require a visit to the physician or the emergency room. The patient was concerned that he got the second shot too soon after having COVID-19 in Dec2020. The clinical outcome of legs were weak and paralyzed in his arms and legs was resolved on 03Mar2021, severe shivers was resolved on 04Mar2021.
