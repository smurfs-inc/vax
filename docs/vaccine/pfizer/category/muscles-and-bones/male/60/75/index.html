                                                Pt received the 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine on Sunday 1/17/21 and developed a sore arm, but otherwise had no symptoms. By Tuesday 1/19/21, he was having shooting pains through his shoulder and down to his elbow. By late Wednesday, he had started to develop hives on his palm, between his fingers, and up to the elbow. Pt states he has a history of a pinched nerve in his neck and elbow, but this pain is nothing like his usual pain.  On 1/22, pt presented to the ED for left uper arm pain and rash. He denied new detergents, foods, clothes, wooded area exposure. Denied decreased ROM in shoulder, but ROM makes his shoulder sore. BP 161/82, otherwise vitals normal. Rash did not apear infectious. No evidence for DVT. Pt received ketorolac 30 mg IM x 1 in ED and was prescribed hydrocodone-APAP 5-325 mg tabs PO Q6h PRN #8. Pt was instructed to follow up with PCP in 1-2 days.  By 1/25/21, pt reports the hives have become dark purple, like bruises. He states he has trouble making a fist and is not using his left arm at all - when this writer spoke to him, he said it was &#34;gimpy.&#34; Pt stated during the phone call that he was about to call his PCP for a follow up appointment.

                                                Severe pain from arthritis in left hip developed about four days after injection in left arm.  This hip occasionally hurts badly in weather change, but this time was unexpected, much more severe than ?normal?, and was not tied to weather. Pain was quite significant for about 24 hours, then subsided, and was normal again in 48 hours.   It hurt like hell for a day( day one being four days after injection), and then hurt a little in the second day, then was gone by day three.   On a scale of 1-10, the pain was a 9-10 for a day, then 6-7 for a day, then was fine.

A 60-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Jan2021 15:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history includes Hypertension, Gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), prostate cancer and broncholith left lung. The patient has no known allergy. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, losartan, pantoprazole, hctz, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN). The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730) on 17Dec2020 and experienced mild numbness and tingling in arms and legs following first dose of vaccine, followed by progressive weakness in legs. On 19Jan2021, the patient developed severe back and leg pain resulting in spinal fusion surgery on 25Jan2021. Postoperatively, the patient developed spastic twitching in thighs on 31Jan2021. On 07Feb2021, he woke up with weakness and clumsiness in left hand. At post-op check for spinal surgery on 10Feb2021, the neurosurgeon recommended another MRI and mentioned possibility of Transverse Myelitis. Following this MRI on 15Feb2021, he was again admitted to hospital for more extensive work up and was admitted for 6 days. Diagnosis made of Transverse Myelitis and was started on high dose steroid treatment and was discharged to home on 17Feb2021. Since then have had profound leg weakness, right side greater than left, which severely impairs mobility, especially stairs. He completed 5 day course of 1000 mg methylprednisolone per day as an outpatient on 20Feb2021. He is in PT and is unable to predict date of return to work. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Disability or permanent damage. Treatment for the events included high dose steroid therapy, PT and exercise. The patient underwent COVID test post vaccination via nasal swab on 24Jan2021 and was negative. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information the reported events are unlikely related to BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent medical conditions.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at the hospital. The patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) on 22Dec2020. Relevant medical history included high blood pressure and diabetes; both were diagnosed in 2006 and ongoing conditions and were under control. Concomitant medications included metformin, lisinopril for high blood pressure, and semaglutide (OZEMPIC, injection), which was a once a week injection kind of like &#34;Trulicity&#34; that encourages his body to make more insulin. The patient said that when he got the second dose of the vaccine on 12Jan2021, he got an achy arm and it went away. At the time of the report on 18Jan2021, almost a week later, he felt like he got the vaccine in his arm again and it was going into his shoulder. The patient was asking if it was normal. He was driving at the time of the call. The patient had been a scrub technician (tech) and an endoscopy tech for 20 years. During the first surge, when they shut down the outpatient surgeries, he went and worked as an aide in the COVID ward. He was glad to get the shot. He did what his kids would do when they were young and would get a shot. He took ibuprofen. Later that evening for the achy arm, he took more ibuprofen. The achy arm lasted only a day. He thought he wasn&#39;t going to have any side effects at all. It felt like a flu shot. The patient clarified that at the time of the report (18Jan2021), his arm felt achy like it was the day he got the shot and the day after. He got the vaccine as he was in the first bunch in the city and he works in healthcare and the fact that he was over 60 years old. The patient stated he could live through it and he was just curious. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The events did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. The patient had no relevant tests. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of achy arm, which included ibuprofen. The patient recovered from the event &#34;achy arm&#34; on 13Jan2021, while the outcome of the event &#34;felt like he got the vaccine in his arm again and it was going into his shoulder/ arm felt achy like it was the day he got the shot and the day after&#34; was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                I have been have contact with my primary care doctor because of the reaction with the first dose. He advised me to take Benadryl 15 minutes before receiving the injection.  I stayed at the vaccination site for an hour instead of 15 minutes. I left the vaccination site and went home and went to sleep, I worked over night. I did not sleep well that day. I got up around 6pm and I went to work at 10pm and I was extremely anxious and tired all night. I was a little confused while at work. I got off work and went to my chiropractor who noticed and my wife also noticed that I was extremely pale, after the appointment I went home and went back to bed. When I woke up I was still exhausted that I ended up calling out out of work that night.  I went back to bed and slept all night till 9am this morning. The next morning my color was back and I was looking better. My energy level is slowing  improving but still feel tired even when I got a good nights of sleep. I don&#39;t know if it related, but I went and brought some new shoes and then my hip started hurting. It is to the point where I set up a doctor&#39;s appointment on Monday to have my hip looked at.   See VAERS report 906796 for first dose reaction.

Strong but not splitting headache. Not like a migraine--not at all as bad.  Very minor nose congestion and sore throat.  Symptoms all ended by 36 hours after 2nd shot

                                                After the vaccine he came home, felt a little less sore than a flu shot.  The next day when he took a shower, and when he went to wash under his armpit was very swollen, and very tender.   He put some ice on it which did not help the swelling.  It bothers him when his T-shirt touches the area, so he tried to wear a regular shirt.  He also had achy pain in his back, weakness in his arms, sore throat and a little cough, no fever.  The armpit still hurts and is still swollen.  Other than the ice he did not take anything else as he takes a lot of medications as it is.  He has not called his doctor because it happened over the weekend, but is going to call her today.   He did have a COVID test yesterday drive through facility at the community hospital as he has a surgery coming up, and they were going to call him if it was positive.  He is scheduled for surgery on his right knee on Thursday.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Jan2021 09:00 AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. He did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications to report.The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-1), on 09Jan2021 09:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization, at the age of 61-year-old. He experienced myalgia at the injection site/pain at inject site after the first dose on 09Jan2021 and resolved on 12Jan2021. The first and second doses of bnt162b2 had the same lot number. On 28Jan2021, the patient received the second dose of bnt162b2. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he experienced mild aches/pain, nausea/malaise. Three days (42-72hours) after 2nd dose, on 31Jan2021, he experienced &#34;significant redness&#34; and swelling at injection site with minimal pain. He described it as &#34;Out of proportion to what should be expected&#34;. The redness and swelling were improving at the time of the report (01Feb2021).  He asked if this should be of concern. He also asked if it was possible that the vaccine was given subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. He developed a good amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. It seemed fine the first day. It took two or more days to develop the swelling. He added that he only had mild myalgia, weakness, and nausea initially on 29Jan2021 after the second dose of the vaccine. Then 48 hours later, he got the large amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. He later clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 9Jan2021 at 09:30 AM in the left arm. He had some myalgia at the injection site on 09Jan2021 that went away on 12Jan2021. Then he received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 09:00 AM in the left arm. Initially he had no pain. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he had myalgia referring to general muscle pain and aches and nausea that only lasted about two hours. He is mostly concerned now about the significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain which he noticed 48 to 72 hours after the second dose of the vaccine. He took some Aleve which gave some relief (for significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain). He asked if this is an expected side effect as it seem out of proportion to him. Outcome of events general muscle pain and aches and weakness was recovered on 30Jan2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 29Jan2021. Outcome of events significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain was recovering. The reporting physician (patient) assessed the causality between the suspect vaccine and all events as related. He assessed the events &#34;swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain&#34; as medically significant (serious), while he assessed the other events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known product safety profile of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), the contributory role of the product cannot be totally excluded.

Last for the duration of the stress, a few seconds.  Left eustachian tube slightly sore, slight earache.  Has gone on for almost a week now.   Best guess is nerve is pressured or damaged?  Will try hydroxide in ear next, in hope it kills whatever&#39;s going on.  Whether this will go away or not is unknown at present.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 61-years of age), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 17Mar2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood clot after a back fusion about 16 years ago (2005), and had a knee replacement 3 months before the vaccine (Dec2020). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took ANCEF [cefazolin sodium] and had allergies; and oxacillin which the patient had allergies and hepatitis. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior to vaccination nor was he tested for covid since vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to Covid vaccine.  It was reported that the day the patient received the first vaccine his calf, foot, and knee swelled up by evening. It stayed swollen for a week and he went to see his doctor. He did an ultrasound on his calf and found a deep blood clot. He was now on blood thinners. He mentioned that he had a knee replacement 3 months before the vaccine but it was progressing fine. Usually blood clots occur after surgery within a 2 week period. He had a blood clot after a back fusion about 16 years ago. He was reporting this because his doctor was not sure why he got the blood clot and it coincided with the vaccine.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included ultrasound scan: found a deep blood clot  in Mar2021. The events started on 17Mar2021 18:30 with outcome of recovering. The events resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result the events with LOVANOX and PRADAXA.  Follow-up attempts are completed.

A 61-year-old-male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021 (received at 61-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis, overactive immune system, unspecified mental health issues, and ongoing muscle pain. Concomitant medications were unspecified; the patient stated that he is on 4 vials of different medicine, or maybe 5. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number was not reported), on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that he had the Covid-19 vaccine. He reported that he was given a handout sheet that he read after he had the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. It was highlighted in yellow that he shouldn&#39;t have taken the Covid-19 vaccine with an overactive immune system. He further reported that the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is affecting his mental health. His mental health started being affected about 7-8 days after receiving the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He stated that he is getting blistering, wet rashes on his legs again. He would like to see what he can do about this, but he will have to do it by mail. He reported that he has to get pictures taken of himself. He has an appointment tomorrow where he got the Covid-19 vaccine. He stated that he also has to go back to the dermatologist that is taking care of his immune system.

When his legs started getting a rash and then blisters, his medical provider took pictures. The rash and blisters are affecting his feet too. The rash on his legs appears about 7-8 days after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 09Mar2021. He reported that what is on his legs started as rash and then turned into blisters. The blisters popped and it&#39;s like poison comes out. The fluid from the blisters smells, and that the fluid is ruining his clothes and is going to ruin shoes. The rash got worse the other day, with blisters forming.  The blisters have now popped and there&#39;s going to be scars. The patient reported that he now has open wounds on his legs that bleed from the popped blisters. He also reported that it felt like all of his arthritis and muscles were affected. He took something for muscle spasms and arthritis, a muscle relaxant, for his back. Everything hit about the same time, 7-8 days after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine on 09Mar2021. The muscle pain has been going on for a while, but it got worse after the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient also experienced joint problems, fever, feeling unwell on an unspecified date, had to overuse inhaler, couldn&#39;t think on an unspecified date. Outcome of affecting his mental health was recovering. Outcome of blistering, wet rashes on legs, muscle pain has been going on for a while, but it got worse after the Covid-19 vaccine was not recovered. Outcome of other events was unknown.

A 62 years old male consumer reported that he received second dose of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8733), via an unspecified route of administration, on 26Mar2021 at 12:00 in Arm Left (at the age of 62-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  The first dose of bnt162b2 was received on 05Mar2021 (Lot: EN6205). Medical history included diabetes mellitus, hypertension from, gastrooesophageal reflux disease from 1977, sleep apnoea syndrome from 2000, pain from 2017, blood cholesterol increased from 2013, vitamin D deficiency from 2013, depression from 2000. Concomitant medications included glipizide for diabetes mellitus; lisinopril started about 1982 or 1983  for high blood pressure; metformin hcl for diabetes mellitus; terazosin hydrochloride from 1987 prescribed for Benign hyperplasia of prostate (BPH) but it turned out to be something else, but he still takes this medication because it helps with his urination; famotidine for acid reflux; amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken for narcolepsy; oxycodone for pain from 2017; VITAMIN B12  for vitamin deficiency from 2016; calcium citrate from 2019 for blood in his urine; fish oil for blood cholesterol from 2013; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3) from 2013; ketamine hcl for depression, and CANNABIS he used it recreationally and probably medicinally too because it helps him sleep. He is not a daytime stoner, he just uses it at night to relax and go to sleep. He started about 2009, when he got a medical card. Caller reported had his vaccine shot at noon on 26Mar2021. He stated he felt fine, he was just tired a little early and went to bed at 10. He woke up at midnight with a headache and a delirious fever. He didn&#39;t test his temperature or anything but it was high enough to where he got delirious, but he doesn&#39;t know how high that was.  He took Tylenol 2500mg capsules which helped with the headache and not the fever, so 4 hours later, he took Ibuprofen  800 mg which seemed to helped with the fever. He stated the headache is gone. Caller stated delirious feverish was gone but then clarifies he doesn&#39;t know if he has recovered completely actually, it feels like he has, but these things are funny sometimes. Caller reported muscle aches started around midnight on 26Mar2021, and were gone by 27Mar2021. Further Caller reported he had swollen joints- his hands, knuckles. He adds his arms and shoulders, but he doesn&#39;t know if that was from laying on them all night for as long as he did because he slept all the next day, too. The swollen joints seems to be resolved at this point. He clarifies all the symptoms started around midnight on 26Mar2021, about 12 hours after the shot. He confirms that he did not have swollen lymph nodes.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 13Jan2021 09:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included taking blood pressure medicine, medicine for uric acid, stated he takes three medications but did not provide product names. The patient had the first COVID shot on 23Dec2020 at 20:30 at the right arm at the age of 63-year-old and clarified he had no problems after first vaccination. The patient experienced leg pain and bruising which started immediately day after second COVID shot on 14Jan2021. Noticed bruising above both kneecaps and down his legs, which felt like pretty severe flu pain. After a period of time, it didn&#39;t&#39; feel right. He didn&#39;t see anything like that listed as side effects. Has gotten a little better but was still there. Takes Ibuprofen and it helps a little with the leg pain and bruising. Feet are a little colder than normal and he still aches, also had muscle aches on 14Jan2021 which he never had before. The outcome of the event leg pain and bruising was recovering and unknown for the rest of the events.  Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.

However, during the 15 minute waiting period after receiving the vaccine, the left side of my face began to feel ever so slightly thick and numb. It felt as if I had been to the dentist for a filling a hours ago.  I never lost speech or had a discernable facial deformity, but the numbing caught me off guard.   The facial feeling faded in about the same manner as the arm recovery.

By 10:30pm, I began having flu like symptoms, (aches, low grade fever, sinus symptoms) took another acetaminophen 1 GM.  At 11:00 pm, developed severe rigors that lasted for approximately 2 hours. I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

It hurt throughout the night, he started to get chills, just like when he had COVID earlier in the year and this morning about 8 a.m. he was running a fever 101.5, muscle ache and joint pain. He felt exactly how he felt, when running a fever. He was experiencing 8 of the 12 side effects, none of the allergic reactions only fever, joint aches. He was experiencing about 90% of the side effects listed on page 3 the paperwork he received. He was not having any breathing issues.

The injection site arm pain was severe in the middle of night, and woke him up in the middle of the night. When he rolled over, he explained that he used both arms to help get out of bed and he could barely get up to go to the restroom. He was wrapped up so the chills were pretty good, when he woke up they were racking chills (which he also experienced these type of chills when he had the COVID virus). No treatment was received. He needed a magnifying glass and to get in the light to see the lot number on the card he was given. He took a boatload of drugs.

By evening about 12 hours post vaccine felt fatigue and some increase in mild baseline myalgias.  During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

                                                Back ache; some soreness in his arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 66-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 12Jan2021 09:15 at single dose in the left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Medical history included prostate cancer from 3 years. Having aches and his back bothering him predates taking the vaccine. A while ago he blew out his knee and his shoulder and three years ago he started having trouble with his back. Family Medical History: heart disease.There were no concomitant medications. He had the flu vaccine from the VA and it can be a little bit of a thing but the last one it ached, made his shoulder worse; the ache lasted six months but it might have been the way it was administered. He has no product or information to provide NDC, lot or expiration date for the flu vaccine he received about two years ago. Mentions he swore off the flu vaccine after that. He was at the VA yesterday for some other business and they told him the shot was available to him so he had it. He is planning to get the second dose on 02Feb2021. He used to take blood thinners and he imagines, like with the blood thinners, that they wouldn&#39;t want him to stack Tylenol on top of the vaccine. He has a few aches and his back is bothering him; which is normal for him; but he would like to know if he can take Tylenol for his back. He noticed some soreness in his arm, a little, when he got home two or three hours later. His sister said to rub it to disperse the medication, so he did. Adds it is not a big deal. Recently he has not been sleeping well; which is also normal for him; so today he slept in; he may have slept too long on his back but his back is aching and he wanted to take some Tylenol for his back. The patient experienced some soreness in his arm on 12Jan2021 with outcome of recovering , back ache on 13Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered.  Treatment received for the event. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On 02/12/2021 around 11:00am I was assigned to have Covid 19 shot at the table#6. At that time I saw the Vaccine was already in the syringe which was in the plastic bag with zipper. Ten days after the shot I felt well, no pain nor swell on my left shoulder. But in the morning of 02/23/2021 after waking up I started to feel hurt to my left arm and the pain was transmitted to the left of my back (left lung). During these 3 days 23,24,25 my pain reached the maximum intensity 10/10 even I took 3 times a day Ibuprofen which was each time 2x200mg. On 02/26/2021 I went to Hospital in the Emergency Unit and after diagnosis the Doctors found that I had 3 heart arteries clog-up. How can I be sure that the liquid in the syringe is the Pfizer Vaccine or something else? I used to see the TVs broadcast on the Covid 19 shot that the nurse inserts the syringe in the small Pzifer bottle, suck the Vaccine into syringe and inject  the vaccine into the shoulder of the patient. Can CDC require that all Covid 19 providers show the vaccine to all patients before the shot? In 2017 I had an Angiogram and my 3 bypasses were not clogged why they are all clogged now? I don&#39;t change my every day diet and I&#39;m very careful with eating fat, cholesterol and salt in my everyday food.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 02Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. There were no concomitant medications nor medical history. He did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. No history of any other vaccines or events. He got his vaccine on Saturday(02Jan2021) at 1:30pm(13:30) and by 5:30pm(17:30) had very sore arms/arm pain, at 7:30pm(19:30) he had chills off and on and was sweating.

Today is testing day at his work and he tested positive for COVID virus on 05Jan2021. Not sure if it&#39;s a coincidence. Again, he got the shot and then started having all these symptoms at 5:30 and 7:30. Now they are both on quarantine for the 10-14 days. He wanted to see if it&#39;s possible to test positive for the virus after getting the shot or is it just a coincidence. He also had some muscle aches in Jan2021. Last night (04Jan2021), he woke up again sweating, but not like on Saturday, but he got really warm and started to sweat a little, and on Sunday(03Jan2021) he was cold all day and had a tiny cough, but it wasn&#39;t significant. Ever so often she would hear him cough. All of a sudden patient would wake up sweating. Again, Saturday he soaked everything. There was no Emergency Room nor Physician Office. Outcome of Very sore arms, sweating was recovering, of pain and fever was unknown, of other events was not recovered.    Information on Lot/Batch has been requested.

Started 2 days after shot with only other symptoms being the return of sore muscle and fatigue that I had with a Covid infection in mid-Nov.  Shot reaction has been more drastic than the Covid illness for me which was fairly mild.

When his chills started, he noticed he was tremoring and shaking and his muscles are achy on Jan2021. He usually waits until his temperature is over 100 to take something and noticed where he got the shot was achy on Jan2021. During the night he went to aching more.

He finally got around, and ate cereal and stuff. He has just been sitting. He would still get the second vaccine, which was not exciting. Outcome of the events aching all over, headaches, and tired are not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.

I curled up in fetal position under a pile of covers for 24 hours. Didn&#39;t fully recovery for 3 days  All simptoms hit me more or less simultaneously within 5 minutes, about 12 hours after 2nd covid shot.  Didn&#39;t seek medical attention, just plowed through it.  I imagined a biological warfare agent would have felt like that. &#34;I thought I was gunna DIE!&#34;

The first 12 hours were the worst, but after 36 hours all symptoms were gone.   DETAIL The Feb 3, 2021 First vaccine - Phizer Feb 18, 2021      5:00 pm suddenly came down with shaking throughout my body and then chills.        6:00 pm shaking subsided       7:00 pm entire body aches from head to feet      Later in evening - fever throughout body Feb 19, 2021 feeling better, but still muscle and joint pain throughout body.  Some slight fever.  No appetite, but can smell chicken broth.  February 20, 2021 feeling better but tired      10:00 am COVID test at pharmacy.      Noon ate peanut butter and crackers      2:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      6:30 pm ate full Mexican dinner  February 21, 2021 feeling good with a good appetite.  NO SYMPTOMS.       9:30 am breakfast      1:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      1:30 pm lunch REFLECTION: During entire time, no difficulty breathing or coughing.  And the other symptoms came and went in 36 hours.  The symptoms I did have are the same as a bad reaction to the 2nd vaccine.  (my muscle aches are not a reaction to the vaccine).  Yet, my reaction was not immediate, rather it was 2 weeks and 1 day after my first vaccine.  Therefore, do I have COVID, or a bad reaction to my first vaccine? WAITING for COVID test results.  Second vaccination is scheduled for upcoming Friday, February 26.

A 67-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ1686, Expiry date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration (arm left) on 18Jan2021, 12:00 (noon) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization, at 67 years old. Medical history included torn rotator cuffs from an unspecified date. The patient previously took Flu shot for immunization. Patient stated his last vaccination he had was the flu shot 6 months before on an unspecified date, that was a while back. Patient had pain in his left arm at the injection site. He is not sleeping because the pain is waking him up. It has been more than a week at 10 days, and it still hurts. It is very sore by his bicep. Events occurred on 19Jan2021, reported as started hurting the next day maybe, it was not immediately after. He says since then he has had pain, and in the past, he has had torn rotator cuffs, and those hurt, but he was not sleeping due to this pain now, he fell asleep at 06:00AM this morning from sheer exhaustion (Jan2021). He says he is very uncomfortable sitting, he can&#39;t lay on that side, and he can&#39;t get comfortable. He was taking MOTRIN 800 mg as needed, and he put ASPERCREME on it. He says that his MOTRIN was prescribed by a doctor, it was the only thing working for the pain for this. He says he also tried Naproxen, then says it&#39;s Aleve actually, he has only taken this once. It was 220 mg, he took one by mouth, one time. He applied the ASPERCREME to the injection site about three times last week, he says he was experimenting here, he does not know. He says he tried ice which helped a little bit, ice always helps, but when it wears out it comes back. He stated he feels the pain walking, when he is putting his shirt on, sitting in his recliner, it is constant. His vaccine card is handwritten, there is no NDC written on there. It has no information about the syringe that was used, NDC/LOT/EXP information were unknown, they didn&#39;t put it down or the information on the card for his wallet. Patient stated he saw a doctor but not for the injection site pain. He stated if it was just initial pain, he wouldn&#39;t be asking but it has been 10 days now, he thought it would be gone by now, he tried to see how long it could last on the paper they gave and called the number from the paper. He says he had no swelling, it was just really sore, he would like to know if this is normal, if so, he can hang on and tough it out. Treatment was given in response to the events. Outcome of the events Injection site pain, not sleeping, it still hurts, it is very sore by his bicep was not recovered. Outcome of the events sheer exhaustion and is very uncomfortable sitting was unknown.

                                                experiencing a bit of body aches; a little achy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s husband) from the medical information team. A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose (at the age of 67-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pacemaker/defibrillator and 25% of heart function. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose on 28Jan2021 and was experiencing a bit of body aches (since Jan2021) and was taking paracetamol (TYLENOL), no other symptoms. The consumer had a little concern because the patient has a pacemaker/defibrillator. Before he had the defibrillator, his heart rate was over 300 but now it was normal and the patient was monitored. The patient&#39;s doctor recommended everybody to get the vaccine. The consumer had a concern about the second shot because he heard that the dose was stronger than the first dose. The consumer wanted to know if that was true. The consumer wanted to know if the patient would be fine for the second dose. The consumer added that the patient only has 25% of heart function. They have talked to his doctors, his cardiologist about getting the vaccine. All the heart doctors were telling their heart patient to get the vaccine to prevent them from getting COVID. The consumer added that after receiving the first COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was a little achy (Jan2021) like when he has the flu shot (for immunization on an unspecified date.) He was going to get over that. It was not raising his heart rate or anything. The consumer clarified further that the patient was just achy but has done really well. The patient slept good last night. He has a heart monitor in the bedroom and had no problems. The consumer wanted to understand if the second shot was thicker than the first shot and what was the difference between the first and second vaccine. The patient has not recovered from the events.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                Two days after vaccination had swelling in both wrists and both hands and fingers. Seeming arthritic condition. Never had any type of arthritis or swelling of hands or wrists. Slight pain in hands and inability to grip or hold items. First took acemetacin for several days with no relief. then tried normal aspirin for several days. After two weeks someone suggested taking ibuprofen. I took 200mg per day and found slight relief. Contacted my PCP on 2/28/2021 to request a video visit that occurred on 3/3/2021 at 8:00 am. Doctor agreed that swelling and arthritic condition was the result of vaccination and advised to take 600 mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours for a week. Have had some relief from this medication. Doctor advised not to take the second vaccination shot.

                                                After about 3 hours (around noon) I began to feel like I was coming down with a cold and fever. By 4PM I had chills and body aches. By 8 pm I took my temperature and it was a low grade 99.8. Through the remainder of the night the chills worsened to the point where I was shaking uncontrollably and I could not get warm. I was also very dizzy. The next day (2/26/21) was more of the same along with a very painful headache and muscle aches especially in my shoulders and neck. That night all of those symptoms continued along with very sharp stabbing pains in my left leg above the knee cap. The dizziness also continued and I nearly passed out trying to get out of bed early in the morning. My fever had increased to 100.5 at the highest. I was also very weak by the end of the day on 2/26/21. On 2/27/21 I was beginning to feel a bit better but still had that low grade fever (now about 99.8) a headache and I remained very weak. The weakness was especially evident in my legs - it was very hard to stand up. It is now 2/28/21 and I am feeling nearly 100% myself again.   From all I had read and understood I was expecting to have a reaction to the 2nd vaccine. I did not consider any of this life threatening nor necessary to call my PCP. Still, I wanted to report these reactions as it is my understanding the adverse reactions to the 2nd vaccination are common in people much younger than me.

He has some questions about the risk of receiving the vaccine. He took the first dosage yesterday morning (on 08Feb2021) and then when he came home, he noticed around 11pm, he woke up and noticed he could not get comfortable. He had chills and that lasted for 30 minutes.  Today, he noticed he has been taking his temperature. The last time he took it, it was 100.4 degrees.

                                                2 1/2 weeks after 1st dose, pain in right gastroc/politeal fossa while walking. Pain only on ambulation, none at rest. No signs of intermittent claudication. No cord, negative homan&#39;s sign, negative erythema. No history of trauma, osteoarthritis of the knee or Baker&#39;s cyst.  I applied heat daily and start 81 mg. of aspirin daily.  After 2 weeks this pain went away. However, within days of dose #2, I had a 7 day bout of colitis with mucus stools, chills, fatigue and myalgia. These symptoms passed. About 2 weeks after dose #2, the right leg pain returned and has not abated.  (second dose administered at a different Walgreens location)

The pain is centered in the area of the surgeries (L3- L5) There was no discomfort at the injection site after the injection. There was no significant physical activity or strain, and no extraordinary dietary changes prior to the reactions. the injection may not be the cause of pain and diarhea, but some of the possible reactions include &#34;..muscle pain.. and feeling unwell&#34;. My primary concerns are: 1) Will the back pain subside?  It is less now, and I hope it will return to normal in time.  2) Should I take any additional injections of the vaccine?

A 69-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood clots (reported as blood thinner). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 2019 and ongoing as blood thinner. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Feb2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization which gave him severe diarrhea, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, a sore arm and it wore him out. After the second dose of the vaccine on 13Mar2021 which was administered in a public health department, the patient experienced sore arm. He was concerned because around 02:00 on 19Mar2021, he got up to go to the bathroom and noticed his left leg was basically numb and rubbery.  As soon as he tried to stand up, he fell. He thought the second vaccine was the one everyone says will be harder than the first. They even gave him a sheet of paper that scared the hell out of him. Thought he was okay after the second vaccine until around 02:00. At first, he thought his leg had just gone to sleep. It was like having noodles for legs. The patient has been urinating almost non-stop which also started around 02:00, this was what woke him up. He had to crawl on hands and knees after falling to get into the bathroom, he had no strength except a smidgen of strength in the right leg. On 18Mar2021, while eating dinner, he had trouble holding his fork and did not think much about it. He had a cramp feeling in right hand. Today, while eating lunch with a fork, he also had a difficulty. The patient eats with his right hand. The patient has been trying to learn how to walk since early this morning. He has worn out his wife since she was cleaning up after him in the bathroom and helping him walk. He couldn&#39;t walk to the commode very well, couldn&#39;t hold his water, and has been making a mess all day. He was at first afraid he was having a stroke but had no stroke symptoms. The patient reported that his weight was 201, then mentioned that during the night he thought about how much he was urinating and got on the scale out of curiosity and it said he weighs 191. At this time, his leg weakness persists but he was able to stand and hold his own body weight. Issue with holding fork and cramp feeling in right hand was persisting. Urinating was persisting and stated he was going about every 2 hours and goes a lot. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 17Mar2021; unknown for stroke, fall, and weight loss; and not recovered for all other events.

WBC WNL, CXR unremarkable for infection, UA neg for bacteria, LFTs WNL, blood cultures negative. Procalcitonin elevated at 17.8 -- suggesting inflammatory response. Patient initially reported feeling better on the morning of 1-19-21, but around 13:00 began rapidly declining (confusion, unable to walk) and started experiencing EKG changes (9 beats of SVT). Patient then coded and resuscitation was attempted for approximately 30 minutes. Patient did not survive the code. Coroner has been notified and family is considering autopsy at time of this report.

                                                Symptoms began with 12 hours of injects. These include excruciating pain in muscles and joints, muscle cramping, headache, chills, and a temperature of 100 degrees. At its worse, I would say that it was far worse than any flu I have had in the past, and was worse than the second shingle shot that I received several months ago. The symptoms last for around 12 hours.

A 70-year-old male patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ek9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 20Jan2021 15:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Sjogren&#39;s syndrome; both from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), and folic acid. The patient previously took Codine and experienced allergy. The patient experienced site pain; and joint pain in knees, back, and neck on 21Jan2021 03:00. Outcome of the events was recovering. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The events were assessed as non-serious. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.

A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 17Jan2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included High cholesterol and bypass surgery. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, famotidine, ezetimibe, and atorvastatin. The patient had no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in 4 weeks. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient had his first COVID vaccine shot on 17Jan2021 16:00. On 17Jan2021 22:00, the patient had an onset of aching in his left hand, wave like impact. The ache became more intense, and then receded, then more intense, then receded, etc. That night, 18Jan2021, he woke up at 03:30 with a pain (not ache) in my left mid finger. Then 30 min later, it receded and he fell back asleep. On Monday, 18Jan2021, he woke up with discomfort/ache in his left hand. It disappeared by mid afternoon of 18Jan2021. On Tuesday, 19Jan2021 02:00, he woke up with pain in his mid finger left hand which again receded and he went back to sleep. On Thursday, 21Jan2021, he noted a diminished use of his left thumb in picking pills off counter and tying his shoelaces. He can replicate the tingly feeling in his left palm and thumb by inverting his hands and stretching them away from him. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was unknown if treatment was given in response to the events. The outcome of the events pain in extremity was recovered on 19Jan2021 and limb discomfort was recovered on 18Jan2021 while the outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered. The patient has not been tested for COVID post vaccination.

Subsequent muscle aches and general soreness without fever the following day (Feb. 10, 2021). Historical episodes of SVT typically last between 1-3 hours, and I had not had a recent SVT episode prior to vaccination. During the 15 hour SVT episode post vaccination, I experienced much higher than normal blood pressure readings and erratic blood glucose levels which cannot be explained by diet changes, even though I was still taking my prescribed medications on schedule.

                                                None of my health care providers have been able to explain the cause of my sudden loss of vision in my left eye at approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb 2021.  At approx. 3:00 a.m. on 8 Feb I called my ophthalmologist&#39;s answering service and my ophthalmologist called me back shortly thereafter.  She told me I should go to the ER which I did at approx. 4:00 a.m. where blood tests were done, an ultrasound of my left eye, CT scan of my head, and MRI of my head were performed all with negative results.  When my vision was tested at the ER using the standard wall chart, I was unable to see the largest letter on the chart with my left eye.  I saw my ophthalmologist at approx. 1:40 p.m. the same day after my 6 1/2 hour ER visit. I was diagnosed with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.  Both of my eyes were dilated and photos were taken of each eye.  I was given an injection of Avastin in my left eye.  As of today, 12 Feb 2021, I am still functionally blind in my left eye.  I can see general large objects but am unable to see details or read written words either near or far.  Prior to approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb, my vision was as it had been for several years prior with little if any degradation.  I typically have an annual eye exam by my ophthalmologist but due to Covid-19 my last eye exam was 9 Dec 2019 at which time there was nothing to suggest that I would have such loss of sight in either of my eyes.  I am a healthy person who takes no or very little medication when prescribed.  I have never been hospitalized (other than this ER visit) or diagnosed with any significant medical condition.  In late Dec 2020 following routine blood tests, I had a teleconference &#34;physical&#34; with my PCP at which time I was declared to be healthy.  Upon leaving the ER at approx. 10:30 a.m. on 8 Feb my &#34;end of visit vitals&#34; were recorded as blood pressure 110/63, BMI 20.92, weight 150 lbs., height 5&#39;11&#34;, temperature 97.6 F, pulse 67, respiration 16, and oxygen saturation 95%.  Late last year I had my usual flu vaccination without any side effects.  After almost 2 weeks, I do still have a bruise at the Pfizer vaccine injection site on my left arm and I experienced mild muscle soreness the evening after my vaccination and the following morning.  Normally I have no adverse reaction to vaccinations.

It also felt like a nerve was being pinched causing a discomfort down to my ache and foot.  Felt like my foot was trying to go to sleep and tingling. This feeling woke me up about 1 am in the morning ( 2/26) and unable to get comfortable to go back to sleep.  Cause me to limp , unable to put full weight on the leg. This lasted all night and during the day has improved.  It feels somewhat weak, but I can put weight on the leg with a light limp. My foot feels like it has recovered from going to sleep and now has blood flowing, less tingling.

A 70-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 13Jan2021 11:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical histories. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been having side effects such as sharp lower back pain going down his right leg on late thursday (14Jan2021) afternoon, but probably the morning of 15Jan2021, which he never had before. It feels almost like a pinched nerve, but hasn&#39;t done anything to exert himself since he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. He did not cause this pain himself and wanted to know if anybody else has reported this. Outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

A 70-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 12Feb2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9809) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included partially blocked cardiac arteries and heart palpitation (in Nov2020, patient consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that patient receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred patient for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that patient&#39;s condition was stable and recommended against catheterization). Known allergies included Sulfa and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO). Concomitant medications included vitamin D at 1000 iU, taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient received first BNT162B2 shot on 12Feb2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm in Feb2021 that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot (Feb2021), patient went for a two-mile walk. Soon after patient started, he experienced intense pain in back that radiated to chest and left arm. Patient returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given his history, patient attributed the pain to his supposed pinched nerve. He tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result. Patient received his second vaccination on 05Mar2021 at 12:00 pm (lot number: EN6203) in left arm. Patient began to experience intense pain in back that radiated to chest and left arm about 24 hours later (06Mar2021 at 15:00).The event intense pain in back that radiated to chest and left arm resulted in: Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Patient was hospitalized for 4 days and received treatment included catherization, insertion of stent. Nasal Swab PCR on 06Mar2021 was negative. Outcome of intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm and attributed the pain to supposed pinched nerve was resolving.

                                                After my first vaccine (EK5730--on 12/26/20), I had absolutely NO reactions. The second one was quite a different matter.   14 hours after the shot, I developed shaking chills. The next day I had myalgias and arthralgias pretty much all over. It was that &#34;run over by a truck&#34; feeling of the flu. Headache, fatigue followed. Appetite was down. No fever.   Slept for many hours.   Now in my third day after the vaccine and not feeling better.   Still, I remain grateful that I was immunized and am taking the optimistic spin that this kind of intense reaction shows my immune system is responding strongly and nicely to the vaccine.  It is miserable though, particularly since the first one was so benign.   I am a family doctor (MD) and am torn between discussing this in my weekly health column which may dissuade patients, some already on the fence, from getting vaccinated. I saw the FDA info confirming higher incidence of side effects with second shot, which was definitely the case with me.

                                                Three to four days after the injection I began to feel muscle and joint aches in my entire body along with fatigue. These symptoms grew in intensity and lasted about seven days, then suddenly diminished and then stopped.  Dates: (1) January 8, 2021: injection; (2)  January 11 - 13: beginning of symptoms; (3) January 16-17: lessening of symptoms; (4) January 18: disappearance of symptoms.   I also experienced soreness in my left arm at the site of the injection.  That began several hours after the injection and was much more intense than the soreness I usually experience with flu shots.  The soreness lasted about 24 hours, again much longer than my experience with flu shorts.  It then suddenly diminished and then stopped--same pattern as the aches and fatigue described above.

                                                Pfizer\BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine On Jan. 27, late in the morning I started to develop a stiff neck which was mild at the beginning, but in the afternoon  became very strong that I could not turn my head. It progressed to hurt considerably by the time to go to bed that I had to support my head with a towel around my neck.  I took a Flurbiprofen 100mg before going to bed and I had the my neck massaged with Aspercream.   I sleep on the sides and moving from one side to the other I had to support my head with my hands. This morning (Jan. 28) the pain went a little down, but looking to the sides was painful. Around noon I took another Flurbiprofen. Tomorrow? Will see.  Now, in the evening, the pain slightly increase again and spreading toward the shoulder blades and  lower on the spine.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes (controlled by food not by injection), coronary artery spasm (blood vessels that occasionally collapsed), glaucoma, and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included albuterol for asthma, atorvastatin (LIPITOR), glyceryl trinitrate (NITROGLYCERIN) for coronary artery spasm, and numbers of eye drops (unspecified) for glaucoma. The patient had taken the COVID-19 vaccine just not too long ago and had good number of non-serious side effects. The patient was not really concerned with these side effects that she had. On 13Jan2021, the patient had the little bit of pain from the injection site but that&#39;s common with any injection, so he did not count it, but next day the events started, and he still had some, but they were subsiding. The next events happened the next day after administration (14Jan2021). The patient had the injection site pain and the arm is still weak, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, nausea, and feeling unwell on 14Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the events.

The intensity was severe enough to prevent sleeping for over eight hours. This was accompanied by chills alternating with feeling hot without a measured fever. Six hours after the onset of pain two 500 mg acetaminophen were taken with some blunting of the pain though minimal improvement. After the initial eight hours the pain in in the joints and muscles subsided over about four hours. The headache that was akin to migraines in the past persisted for another six hours and was eventually relieved by two doses of ibuprofen 600 mg six hours apart.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3302), intramuscular on 22Jan2021 15:10 at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml by intramuscular injection left shoulder) for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure (diagnosed about 21 years ago), ongoing gout (Diagnosed about 2 years ag), ongoing ankle spur right foot, ongoing diminished cartilage both knees, joint pain. The concomitant medications included torsemide. The patient reported adverse event (AE) after his first Pfizer-Biontech covid19 vaccine at 15:10  on 22Jan2021. He reported arm pain starting 3 hours after vaccination until noon the next day (23Jan2021). When he woke up on 23Jan2021 he reported lower back pain, that has migrated more to the right hip and into the glute. The pain inhibits walking, standing, etc. He did note that he is &gt;300lbs and has had joint pain in the past, but the hip pain is new. He also thought it might be kidney pain, as he takes a daily diuretic. He stated he has been treating with Aleve twice a day, but that walking is still very bad.  The patient is an optometrist that was calling about the Covid-19 vaccine and said that he did not know if the Lot number written on the vaccination card is EL3302, E13302, or EI3302. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and reported that he got a sore arm about 3 hours after receiving the injection. He woke up with a sore lower back pain. He is 5ft 9.5 and 310 lbs and he is on Torsemide, a pretty strong diuretic. He woke up with the back pain and stated that it moved right and middle to his buttocks, a little lower than the end of his spine and to the right. He did not think it was his kidneys. He said that Torsemide can make kidneys work overtime. His knees were pretty shot, the left worse than the right. No further details provided. He was upset to know that he has shrunk a 1.5 inches over the years. He has been taking 2 Aleve a day since Saturday, this morning was his 4th pill. He said that it is really odd when he stands equally on both feet his lower back hurts. He has to sleep on his right side and that it hurts more when he sleeps on his back and on his left side. He was fearful doing eye exams next to his patient and how the lower back pain would affect him.  Reporter considered seriousness for Lower back pain was Medically significant. The outcome of event lower back pain was not recovered; of event arm pain was recovered on 23Jan2021; of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event low back pain cannot be excluded. The ongoing gout and concomitant drug torsemide may also play contributory roles to the event. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Soreness in the right side of neck; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer sponsored program from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 71-year-old male patient (weight 102.06 kg and height 178 cm) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EL2349) on 22Jan2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included blood pressure abnormal and blood cholesterol abnormal. Concomitant medications included lisinopril 10 mg, from an unspecified date, for blood pressure abnormal. On 22Jan2021, about an hour after the vaccination, the patient experienced soreness in the right side of his neck. The patient was treated with Tylenol. The patient did not recover from the adverse event at time of this report. The next shot will be received 12Feb2021.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Approximately 1 week after the Pfizer dose I had a small lump and soreness over my right flank at the kidney level.  Over the next two days that pain migrated to my right buttock and radiated down my right leg.  With full weight applied to my right leg the leg had weakness and would occasionally buckle.  I am due for my second injection but am considering not taking the second injection fearing permanent nerve involvement.  As of today 2/23 the pain in my right leg and buttocks is lessened but still present.

When he presented to the medical treatment area he was c/o this right sided chest pain that was worsened by inspiration. The pain was non-radiating and was also associated w/ shortness of breath. He has been experiencing shortness of breath intermittently over the past couple of weeks. The patient denied associated dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, vision changes. He noted that he has a prior history of DVT and PE, but is not on any anticoagulation medications. He is currently being treated for bacteremia from a dog bite wound and receiving IV antibiotics through a port. He also has hx of CLL, currently on oral chemotherapy medication.

I think I am supposed to notify my doctor and you guys will generate a report to the government. Here are the circumstances: I received the vaccine on 02/10/21. It was Pfizer Lot Number EN5318. I got severe abdominal pain (lower left side below rib cage) four days later. I also had very bad lower back muscle pain (left side at waistline). This lasted all day. On day 2 the pain was down by about half and the back pain was gone. On day 3 I had only slight abdominal pain. It was completely gone by day 4.

                                                About 8 hours after injection, I began having pain on right side of back just under ribs. Pain worsened through night, causing difficult sleep. On evening of second day, pain spread to right flank and right front of abdomen, causing entire right side of abdomen to experience significant pain. It is possible this is muscular pain, but after reading the Internet, I believe it is inflammation of the gallbladder. I have never before experienced gallbladder issues. The pain is much worse than the &#34;muscle aches&#34; described as a COVID vaccine side effect. There is no fever or other significant symptoms. Today (third day) I emailed my doctor. His nurse responded that it is hard to tell if it is vaccine related, and that if it begins to resolve not to be concerned about it, but if it gets worse I should be seen by the doctor. I am taking Tylenol and applying Voltarin topically, but neither helps much.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

This morning the pain has dropped to my right buttock and is radiating down my right leg; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 71-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9264) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Feb2021 (at the age of 71-years-old), for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were no concomitant medications and no other vaccine was administered on the same date. Exactly one week after the injection, on 17Feb2021, the patient began having routine symptoms including weakness, tiredness, and chills. The unusual and unexpected symptom was a right flank pain that seemed to be over the right kidney. According to the patient, it seemed to be muscular, so he dismissed it. On the morning of 21Feb2021, the pain had dropped to his right buttock and was radiating down his right leg. The patient also reported a weakness in his right leg and that his right leg had buckled a couple times this morning (21Feb2021). The patient did not receive treatment for weakness, tiredness, chills, right flank pain, muscular (pain), pain had dropped to his right buttock and was radiating down right leg, weakness in right leg, and right leg had buckled. The clinical outcome of weakness, tiredness, chills, right flank pain, muscular (pain), pain had dropped to his right buttock and was radiating down right leg, weakness in right leg, and right leg had buckled was not recovered.

Consumer stated, &#34;I got my Covid 19 vaccination yesterday, the first one and I was reading all these side effects and the only thing that I had a question for is that I got the vaccination at approximately 4 O&#39;clock in the afternoon and at 10 O&#39;clock at night, on the arm that I got the shot, I got a swelling on my elbow. It is like a spongy node, it is like a ball of water and it is not at the injection site. It is on my elbow it just showed up. So, it is a side effect that I am reporting. I called the health department and they told me to call my physician. I called my physician, he told me to call my health department. You know, I got frustrated. I saw this number, I am calling you guys to report the side effect. It does not hurt and no pain. It is just a blob on my elbow.&#34; The patient did not receive treatment for the event. The outcome of the event was unknown.

ER or Hip Surgeon can find no reason, tell me I?ve strained my hip somehow. I?m at 2 weeks now, and can still not walk without severe pain and a walker. Wish I had never got the vaccine, and definitely won?t get the second vaccination!!!

A few hours after 2nd covid injection, along with  mild myalgias/prodromal sx., I went into atrial fib., with mild tach. but no other problems.  The arrythmia persisted for ~24 hr.s then converted back to sinus rhythm-- and fine since.  This event is more of an interesting observation than an &#34;adverse event&#34; but as the spike protein binds to ACE2 receptors, I thought the two events might be related and possibly of interest to you.

With these, his primary care provider was very much concerned, and he had a battery of tests done then he was discovered to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) on 22Jan2021. He informed that his primary care provider asked him to go into the office since the primary care provider was convinced that it was something more than just a reaction to the Pfizer covid vaccine. He had more tests on 22Jan2021 and that was when he was diagnosed with a UTI. It was a minimal UTI, not of any consequence, that when the doctor pushed on his bladder it hurt on 22Jan2021. He then received an intravenous antibiotic in the emergency room for the UTI but confirmed that he was not admitted. He stated that he has never had a reaction to any medication he has taken before.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Dec2020 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He was an ER doctor and the medical director of his hospital. The patient was asymptomatic when he got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. 3 hours after the vaccine he began to get chills, HA, anorexia, myalgias, and extreme fatigue. This worsened and he slept all and had no appetite. On 19Dec2020 he woke up delirious with a fever and was ataxic, hypoxic, incontinent, and confused. The patient was hospitalized due to the events on 15Dec2020. The events also caused prolonged hospitalization due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID via nasal swab post vaccination with unknown results. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as the patient required oxygen, plasma, and remdisivir.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, BNT162B2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of reported serious events might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  Fever, chills, headache, fatigue and muscle pain are the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  More information such as detailed underlying medical conditions and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown. The patient died on 11Feb2021. The patient&#39;s official time of death was Thursday, 11Feb2021, at 12:08AM. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued. The reporter stated she thought it was important to notify Pfizer of her husband&#39;s passing because his side effects fell within the expected time period after receiving his second COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death

The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient mentioned that he received his 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID19 Vaccine and 5 minutes after, they noticed a blood vessel had busted in his right eye, the same side where he got injected on his right arm. He thinks some blood had dried in his eyes and it was red that afternoon and the next day. He had a right eye busted blood vessel and it turned red. The whole white turned red. They watched him for another 15 minutes and it just stayed red. After a few days, the redness went away, but it left floaters in his right eye. He mentioned that he got 50-150 floaters in his right eye. He has a bunch of black floaters. Floaters are not directly in his sight, but he can see them all around. It has not impaired his sight. If they move in his line of sight, he can still see through them. He did not take second shot. He was scared to because he would get more floaters. It has been 3 weeks already and he still has floaters and it has not changed. Second shot was scheduled for 19Mar2021. Two weeks after first and a week before second one, he decided he did not want to get second shot. Fatigue got better 7 days after. Taste and smell took longer to return but came back since then. He takes regular medications for high blood pressure and did not feel they were relevant. Headache comes and goes but improved. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. No previous history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect.

A contactable consumer reported that a 74-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162b2(COMIRNATY, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207, Expiration: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 19Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history includes Arthritis (arthritis is in his right foot only and his big toe, diagnosed in 2017 or 2018) and Concomitant medication were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY) on 26Feb2021 for Covid-19 immunisation and Unspecified steroid shot. Stated reaction was three to four days. First shot got caller and patient down for a week. Second shot got caller down for three days. At first, patient&#39;s reaction was running like hers. Patient had a dry cough on an unspecified date in 2021. Was going for a COVID test today. Last week patient started running a fever on an unspecified date in 2021 and his legs were extremely weak on 14Apr2021. Has to hold onto something to go through the house on 14Apr2021. He was moving a little better, but not much. Patient had to go to doctor for his foot. Has terrible arthritis in the big toe on his right foot. Gets steroid shot every three months. Three weeks and four days after second COVID shot everything seemed to have worn off. The PA put the shot in his foot and it bruised the patient. Patient still has bruises on an unspecified date in 2021. Got the steroid shot in his big toe and two days later the weakness hit a second time. It really wiped him out. Caller cannot help patient get up and down. Patient was struggling with his legs and was aching. Wants to know if a steroid shot on top of the COVID shot and that close after would cause another reaction? The PA said it was ok to get a steroid shot three weeks after. Patient started having these reactions and doesn&#39;t know if it was the COVID shot. Has had steroid shots every 3 months for 4 years. Has never had this kind of reaction. Patient didn&#39;t think about getting the steroid shot because he seemed to be feeling fine. Reaction started the next morning and it was even worse on an unspecified date in 2021. By the third day after the shot he was down and caller couldn&#39;t help patient get up. It scared the caller. Patient also broke out in a rash across his shoulders and down both arms. States her husband has had both shots and he has been having issues since the second one n 19MAR2021. Reporter states 3 weeks and 4 days after the second vaccine, her husband had to have a steroid shot in his foot because he has terrible arthritis in his right foot. Reporter states the patient has had a flare up since then with weakness in his legs and a rash on his chest. States the only difference this time is that he had just had the second Covid vaccine 3 weeks prior. States he has not had steroid reactions in the past, and she feels like this reaction was because of the Covid vaccine. Clarifies the shot in his foot was on 13Apr2021 and she does not know what steroid was injected. States it was 3weeks and 4 days between the steroid injection and the vaccine. States maybe they should war people not to get a steroid shot for a longer time after the vaccine. States after the first vaccine for about 5 days they were just laid out. States they ate soup and whatever they could warm up in the microwave. States his ear doctor said if they reacted to the first shot they must have had Covid at sometimes. States she doesn&#39;t know, they never got tested before but they didn&#39;t have any symptoms. States her husband&#39;s test yesterday was negative. Weakness in the Legs AE: States for the last 2 days, he could not even get up on his own and she can&#39;t lift him because he was bigger than she was. Rash was states it was not itching or anything, just a rash. States it was odd because she has had hives, and this was just broken out. Clarifies the rash was across his upper back, chest, and down both arms on 14Apr2021. States it was kind of like speckled on his body like the measles on an unspecified date in 2021. States the patient was 74 years old and he had measles when he was a kid just like she did, so it is not the measles. States the patient had a Covid 19 test done yesterday and it came back negative, so he doesn&#39;t have Covid. She doesn&#39;t know what it was. Treatment: states he was taking Motrin for the Aching. States she does not know if the reaction was because the PA did the injection, it had always been the doctor that had given the injection. Caller states she thinks it was getting the steroid injection on top of receiving the Covid shot. States the both received their vaccines because they couldn&#39;t get a shot because they weren&#39;t giving shots at her age, so when offered them the vaccine, they jumped on it. Yes, last Monday to his Nurse Practitioner, did not address the weakness in his legs because did not know what to do for that. She did not even say what she thought it was, said he needed to see someone about that but does not know who to see, does not know whether to go to the ER or who to go to. Not that emergent but when doctor does not know what to treat with worrisome. She was calling about to finish the report and to speak with the Medical department regarding if this has been reported before or if any information on the Covid vaccine and steroid injections. He received the 1st dose on 26Feb2021 and the 2nd dose on 19Mar2021. She mentioned that both of them experienced achiness, sore all over after the 1st dose and flu-like symptoms on an unspecified date in 2021 after both doses. Her husband however, had muscle weakness on his legs after the 2nd dose. On 13Apr2021, about 3 weeks and 4 days after the 2nd dose, her husband received a steroid shot on his right foot. They noticed that the weakness on his legs became extreme, to which he had trouble standing up and has to hold on to something to stand up as he cannot support himself. He also had a rash on his trunk, back, and down his arms. She mentioned that the rash was not itchy but was speckled like measles. They were wondering if this has been reported and if it was possibly an interaction between the vaccine and steroid. They mentioned that they already consulted with their HCP but said that they really cannot tell. Outcome of his legs were extremely weak, has to hold onto something to go through the house was not recovered while with other event rash is across his upper back, chest, and down both arms, Achy all over was recovered on 22Mar2021 and flu-like symptoms after both doses and Sore all Over was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021, while with other events was unknown.  Follow up attempts were needed. Further information is expected.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 02Mar2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 75-years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Ongoing concomitant medications included diazepam for dizziness since 1978, allopurinol for hyperuricemia, oxycodone hydrochloride/paracetamol (PERCOCET) for back pain since 7-8 years ago. There were no other vaccines administered on the same day or within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9262) on 09Feb2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 75-years-old) in the left arm and experienced muscle aches.

On 03Mar2021 at 07:00 he was paralyzed in his arms and legs- he could feel his muscles but couldn&#39;t make them move. He just laid there for ten hours, and it was scary, and he thought that over a period of time the vaccine would get filtered out. After that, he was fully recovered and able to move. The events did not require a visit to the physician or the emergency room. The patient was concerned that he got the second shot too soon after having COVID-19 in Dec2020. The clinical outcome of legs were weak and paralyzed in his arms and legs was resolved on 03Mar2021, severe shivers was resolved on 04Mar2021.
