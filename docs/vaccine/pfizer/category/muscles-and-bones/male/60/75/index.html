Following surgery, paresthesia and weakness persisted and  actually worsened, , developed uncontrolled twitching in both thighs.  Further developed loss of function in his L-hand.  MRI revealed transverse myelitis.  Symptoms have improved with corticosteroid therapy.  Patient was hospitalized due to these symptoms for two days, discharged on corticosteroids.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Jan2021 09:00 AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. He did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications to report.The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-1), on 09Jan2021 09:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization, at the age of 61-year-old. He experienced myalgia at the injection site/pain at inject site after the first dose on 09Jan2021 and resolved on 12Jan2021. The first and second doses of bnt162b2 had the same lot number. On 28Jan2021, the patient received the second dose of bnt162b2. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he experienced mild aches/pain, nausea/malaise. Three days (42-72hours) after 2nd dose, on 31Jan2021, he experienced &#34;significant redness&#34; and swelling at injection site with minimal pain. He described it as &#34;Out of proportion to what should be expected&#34;. The redness and swelling were improving at the time of the report (01Feb2021).  He asked if this should be of concern. He also asked if it was possible that the vaccine was given subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. He developed a good amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. It seemed fine the first day. It took two or more days to develop the swelling. He added that he only had mild myalgia, weakness, and nausea initially on 29Jan2021 after the second dose of the vaccine. Then 48 hours later, he got the large amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. He later clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 9Jan2021 at 09:30 AM in the left arm. He had some myalgia at the injection site on 09Jan2021 that went away on 12Jan2021. Then he received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 09:00 AM in the left arm. Initially he had no pain. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he had myalgia referring to general muscle pain and aches and nausea that only lasted about two hours. He is mostly concerned now about the significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain which he noticed 48 to 72 hours after the second dose of the vaccine. He took some Aleve which gave some relief (for significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain). He asked if this is an expected side effect as it seem out of proportion to him. Outcome of events general muscle pain and aches and weakness was recovered on 30Jan2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 29Jan2021. Outcome of events significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain was recovering. The reporting physician (patient) assessed the causality between the suspect vaccine and all events as related. He assessed the events &#34;swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain&#34; as medically significant (serious), while he assessed the other events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known product safety profile of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), the contributory role of the product cannot be totally excluded.

                                                On January 18, 2021, I experienced extreme weakness of both legs to the extent that I was unable to stand.  I experienced an exacerbation of baseline numbness over many areas of my body. I had an elevated resting heart rate of over 108 bpm.  I was transported by ambulance to that afternoon.

By 10:30pm, I began having flu like symptoms, (aches, low grade fever, sinus symptoms) took another acetaminophen 1 GM.  At 11:00 pm, developed severe rigors that lasted for approximately 2 hours. I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

This is the first of two reports. A 64-year-old male patient receive first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), at same age intramuscular in arm left on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee, a knot on the left side of his head, bleeding from above his left eyebrow, had a left black eye, all on Nov2020, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cataract surgery, using crutches when he walks, in the hospital from Nov2020 to 17Nov2020, pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital on Nov2020, he couldn&#39;t walk on 19Nov2020, 6 stents, 3 cardiac stents on Oct2020, and chicken pox as a young adult. Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) from unspecified date to 27Jan2021 for 6 stents, paracetamol (TYLENOL, 500 mg, caplets, NDC Number: 5058044936, Lot Number: SJA066 and Expiration Date: Jul2024). The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn&#39;t had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

By evening about 12 hours post vaccine felt fatigue and some increase in mild baseline myalgias.  During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

                                                Back ache; some soreness in his arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 66-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 12Jan2021 09:15 at single dose in the left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Medical history included prostate cancer from 3 years. Having aches and his back bothering him predates taking the vaccine. A while ago he blew out his knee and his shoulder and three years ago he started having trouble with his back. Family Medical History: heart disease.There were no concomitant medications. He had the flu vaccine from the VA and it can be a little bit of a thing but the last one it ached, made his shoulder worse; the ache lasted six months but it might have been the way it was administered. He has no product or information to provide NDC, lot or expiration date for the flu vaccine he received about two years ago. Mentions he swore off the flu vaccine after that. He was at the VA yesterday for some other business and they told him the shot was available to him so he had it. He is planning to get the second dose on 02Feb2021. He used to take blood thinners and he imagines, like with the blood thinners, that they wouldn&#39;t want him to stack Tylenol on top of the vaccine. He has a few aches and his back is bothering him; which is normal for him; but he would like to know if he can take Tylenol for his back. He noticed some soreness in his arm, a little, when he got home two or three hours later. His sister said to rub it to disperse the medication, so he did. Adds it is not a big deal. Recently he has not been sleeping well; which is also normal for him; so today he slept in; he may have slept too long on his back but his back is aching and he wanted to take some Tylenol for his back. The patient experienced some soreness in his arm on 12Jan2021 with outcome of recovering , back ache on 13Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered.  Treatment received for the event. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On 02/12/2021 around 11:00am I was assigned to have Covid 19 shot at the table#6. At that time I saw the Vaccine was already in the syringe which was in the plastic bag with zipper. Ten days after the shot I felt well, no pain nor swell on my left shoulder. But in the morning of 02/23/2021 after waking up I started to feel hurt to my left arm and the pain was transmitted to the left of my back (left lung). During these 3 days 23,24,25 my pain reached the maximum intensity 10/10 even I took 3 times a day Ibuprofen which was each time 2x200mg. On 02/26/2021 I went to Hospital in the Emergency Unit and after diagnosis the Doctors found that I had 3 heart arteries clog-up. How can I be sure that the liquid in the syringe is the Pfizer Vaccine or something else? I used to see the TVs broadcast on the Covid 19 shot that the nurse inserts the syringe in the small Pzifer bottle, suck the Vaccine into syringe and inject  the vaccine into the shoulder of the patient. Can CDC require that all Covid 19 providers show the vaccine to all patients before the shot? In 2017 I had an Angiogram and my 3 bypasses were not clogged why they are all clogged now? I don&#39;t change my every day diet and I&#39;m very careful with eating fat, cholesterol and salt in my everyday food.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 02Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. There were no concomitant medications nor medical history. He did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. No history of any other vaccines or events. He got his vaccine on Saturday(02Jan2021) at 1:30pm(13:30) and by 5:30pm(17:30) had very sore arms/arm pain, at 7:30pm(19:30) he had chills off and on and was sweating. He woke up soaking wet and did that on Sunday, but was feeling a little better today. He also experienced body aches and fever in Jan2021. Today is testing day at his work and he tested positive for COVID virus on 05Jan2021. Not sure if it&#39;s a coincidence. Again, he got the shot and then started having all these symptoms at 5:30 and 7:30. Now they are both on quarantine for the 10-14 days. He wanted to see if it&#39;s possible to test positive for the virus after getting the shot or is it just a coincidence. He also had some muscle aches in Jan2021. Last night (04Jan2021), he woke up again sweating, but not like on Saturday, but he got really warm and started to sweat a little, and on Sunday(03Jan2021) he was cold all day and had a tiny cough, but it wasn&#39;t significant. Ever so often she would hear him cough. All of a sudden patient would wake up sweating. Again, Saturday he soaked everything. There was no Emergency Room nor Physician Office. Outcome of Very sore arms, sweating was recovering, of pain and fever was unknown, of other events was not recovered.    Information on Lot/Batch has been requested.

Medical history was reported as none. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient had no allergies to medications, food or other products. Concomitant medications included lisinopril and sertaconazole nitrate (SERTALIN); all for unknown indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. On 31Dec2020 at 04:00, the patient experienced raised blood pressure of 165/74, aching joints, muscle pain, swelling of the face and fatigue. The events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, and an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient was not treated for the events. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The clinical outcome of the raised blood pressure of 165/74, aching joints, muscle pain, swelling of the face and fatigue was resolving.

                                                Got shot about 2:00 PM, left after 30 minutes.  While sleeping around 3:45 AM started getting chills, had muscle pain, joint pain, feeling unwell, injection site pain as well.  Injection site pain is untouchable right now.  No fever during the night, at 9:30 AM temp 99.6.  At 7:00 AM had strong urge to vomit, but did not.  Could not stand or walk to the bathroom or anything.  Now still feeling better, but still has the tiredness, no chills, has a slight headache.   Seems to be getting better in general.

Started 2 days after shot with only other symptoms being the return of sore muscle and fatigue that I had with a Covid infection in mid-Nov.  Shot reaction has been more drastic than the Covid illness for me which was fairly mild.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3302 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol since 90s and was taking medication to keep it down, and ongoing neuropathy in the feet back in the 90s. Patient seemed to be okay after the vaccination until he didn&#39;t rest well last night on 13Jan2021. The morning of 14Jan2021, he had chills and was aching all over. He has a headache, and he was pretty tired on 14Jan2021. His temperature was 99.9. and wanted to make sure he was okay. They gave him the sheet of side effects but was wondering how long it was going to last. He also had fever and chills on Jan2021. He has been just resting all day long which was all he felt like doing. Patient felt he has a bad case of the flu. When his chills started, he noticed he was tremoring and shaking and his muscles are achy on Jan2021. He usually waits until his temperature is over 100 to take something and noticed where he got the shot was achy on Jan2021. During the night he went to aching more. He was not too excited about getting up and doing anything now. He was tired on 14Jan2021, because he didn&#39;t rest well last night and slept in late today. He finally got around, and ate cereal and stuff. He has just been sitting. He would still get the second vaccine, which was not exciting. Outcome of the events aching all over, headaches, and tired are not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.

A 67-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ1686, Expiry date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration (arm left) on 18Jan2021, 12:00 (noon) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization, at 67 years old. Medical history included torn rotator cuffs from an unspecified date. The patient previously took Flu shot for immunization. Patient stated his last vaccination he had was the flu shot 6 months before on an unspecified date, that was a while back. Patient had pain in his left arm at the injection site. He is not sleeping because the pain is waking him up. It has been more than a week at 10 days, and it still hurts. It is very sore by his bicep. Events occurred on 19Jan2021, reported as started hurting the next day maybe, it was not immediately after. He says since then he has had pain, and in the past, he has had torn rotator cuffs, and those hurt, but he was not sleeping due to this pain now, he fell asleep at 06:00AM this morning from sheer exhaustion (Jan2021). He says he is very uncomfortable sitting, he can&#39;t lay on that side, and he can&#39;t get comfortable. He was taking MOTRIN 800 mg as needed, and he put ASPERCREME on it. He says that his MOTRIN was prescribed by a doctor, it was the only thing working for the pain for this. He says he also tried Naproxen, then says it&#39;s Aleve actually, he has only taken this once. It was 220 mg, he took one by mouth, one time. He applied the ASPERCREME to the injection site about three times last week, he says he was experimenting here, he does not know. He says he tried ice which helped a little bit, ice always helps, but when it wears out it comes back. He stated he feels the pain walking, when he is putting his shirt on, sitting in his recliner, it is constant. His vaccine card is handwritten, there is no NDC written on there.

                                                experiencing a bit of body aches; a little achy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s husband) from the medical information team. A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose (at the age of 67-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pacemaker/defibrillator and 25% of heart function. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose on 28Jan2021 and was experiencing a bit of body aches (since Jan2021) and was taking paracetamol (TYLENOL), no other symptoms. The consumer had a little concern because the patient has a pacemaker/defibrillator. Before he had the defibrillator, his heart rate was over 300 but now it was normal and the patient was monitored. The patient&#39;s doctor recommended everybody to get the vaccine. The consumer had a concern about the second shot because he heard that the dose was stronger than the first dose. The consumer wanted to know if that was true. The consumer wanted to know if the patient would be fine for the second dose. The consumer added that the patient only has 25% of heart function. They have talked to his doctors, his cardiologist about getting the vaccine. All the heart doctors were telling their heart patient to get the vaccine to prevent them from getting COVID. The consumer added that after receiving the first COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was a little achy (Jan2021) like when he has the flu shot (for immunization on an unspecified date.) He was going to get over that. It was not raising his heart rate or anything. The consumer clarified further that the patient was just achy but has done really well. The patient slept good last night. He has a heart monitor in the bedroom and had no problems. The consumer wanted to understand if the second shot was thicker than the first shot and what was the difference between the first and second vaccine. The patient has not recovered from the events.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

Patient was advise to seek urgent medical care and reported back to ED on 1-19-21 at 00:55. Patient wasd admitted for SIRS (tachycardia and febrile) -- patient also reported diffuse myalgia. WBC WNL, CXR unremarkable for infection, UA neg for bacteria, LFTs WNL, blood cultures negative. Procalcitonin elevated at 17.8 -- suggesting inflammatory response. Patient initially reported feeling better on the morning of 1-19-21, but around 13:00 began rapidly declining (confusion, unable to walk) and started experiencing EKG changes (9 beats of SVT). Patient then coded and resuscitation was attempted for approximately 30 minutes. Patient did not survive the code. Coroner has been notified and family is considering autopsy at time of this report.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                None of my health care providers have been able to explain the cause of my sudden loss of vision in my left eye at approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb 2021.  At approx. 3:00 a.m. on 8 Feb I called my ophthalmologist&#39;s answering service and my ophthalmologist called me back shortly thereafter.  She told me I should go to the ER which I did at approx. 4:00 a.m. where blood tests were done, an ultrasound of my left eye, CT scan of my head, and MRI of my head were performed all with negative results.  When my vision was tested at the ER using the standard wall chart, I was unable to see the largest letter on the chart with my left eye.  I saw my ophthalmologist at approx. 1:40 p.m. the same day after my 6 1/2 hour ER visit. I was diagnosed with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.  Both of my eyes were dilated and photos were taken of each eye.  I was given an injection of Avastin in my left eye.  As of today, 12 Feb 2021, I am still functionally blind in my left eye.  I can see general large objects but am unable to see details or read written words either near or far.  Prior to approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb, my vision was as it had been for several years prior with little if any degradation.  I typically have an annual eye exam by my ophthalmologist but due to Covid-19 my last eye exam was 9 Dec 2019 at which time there was nothing to suggest that I would have such loss of sight in either of my eyes.  I am a healthy person who takes no or very little medication when prescribed.  I have never been hospitalized (other than this ER visit) or diagnosed with any significant medical condition.  In late Dec 2020 following routine blood tests, I had a teleconference &#34;physical&#34; with my PCP at which time I was declared to be healthy.  Upon leaving the ER at approx. 10:30 a.m. on 8 Feb my &#34;end of visit vitals&#34; were recorded as blood pressure 110/63, BMI 20.92, weight 150 lbs., height 5&#39;11&#34;, temperature 97.6 F, pulse 67, respiration 16, and oxygen saturation 95%.  Late last year I had my usual flu vaccination without any side effects.  After almost 2 weeks, I do still have a bruise at the Pfizer vaccine injection site on my left arm and I experienced mild muscle soreness the evening after my vaccination and the following morning.  Normally I have no adverse reaction to vaccinations.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

Then his wife asked if he was alright as he had yelled for her prior to that.  She went and found him on the floor, but stated that he was alright.  Did not hit his head or anything.  Got him up and lied him on the bed.  His left leg was under his right leg and she asked him to straighten it out, and did not respond with an answer regarding moving his leg.  Was looking at her with a glazed look and did not answer, and did not talk or respond to anything.  He was propped up against the door and did not respond she called 9-1-1.  They took him to the hospital, did not respond.  Now his left side is paralyzed and he did have a brain bleed in the front cerebral lobe.  To this day 3/1/21 has been in the hospital and still does not have movement on his left side.  He is able to talk now every now or then, does speak sentences more, and other days he&#39;s not able to speak or move.      On 2/20/21 because he has been able to talk, and not able to eat they had to insert a feeding tube into his stomach.  At that time he was at one place for 1 day and transferred to Hospital until 2/27/21.  He is now at Retirement and Skilled Care facility for rehab.

A 70-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 13Jan2021 11:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical histories. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been having side effects such as sharp lower back pain going down his right leg on late thursday (14Jan2021) afternoon, but probably the morning of 15Jan2021, which he never had before. It feels almost like a pinched nerve, but hasn&#39;t done anything to exert himself since he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. He did not cause this pain himself and wanted to know if anybody else has reported this. Outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

He was admitted to hospital on 3/16 for acute stroke workup given his VERY CLEAR Facial droop, slurred speech. His CT  Head was negative for acute bleed and his MRI Brain was negative for any acute stroke. He was seen by Neurologist while inpatient and was determined to have Bell Palsy and NOT an acute or subacute stroke.   Prior to taking the vaccine, he had NO facial droop. After taking the vaccine, he received no new medications nor did he travel to any other places. Additionally, he lives in a city and has not been hiking in the woods.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                After my first vaccine (EK5730--on 12/26/20), I had absolutely NO reactions. The second one was quite a different matter.   14 hours after the shot, I developed shaking chills. The next day I had myalgias and arthralgias pretty much all over. It was that &#34;run over by a truck&#34; feeling of the flu. Headache, fatigue followed. Appetite was down. No fever.   Slept for many hours.   Now in my third day after the vaccine and not feeling better.   Still, I remain grateful that I was immunized and am taking the optimistic spin that this kind of intense reaction shows my immune system is responding strongly and nicely to the vaccine.  It is miserable though, particularly since the first one was so benign.   I am a family doctor (MD) and am torn between discussing this in my weekly health column which may dissuade patients, some already on the fence, from getting vaccinated. I saw the FDA info confirming higher incidence of side effects with second shot, which was definitely the case with me.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 19Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included liver cancer and chemo. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that for two times, the patient woke up in the morning delirious, did not know where he was, hollering for his wife, couldn&#39;t get up, got sick and vomited, after he got up he felt pretty good. States he fell asleep on couch that night, toward morning he rolled onto floor, flopping around on floor like a wet seal, flopping arms around tried to roll over, pulled muscle in rib cage, after he got back up, got sick and had to vomit. Once he got up and went to the bathroom and all of that went away, wanted to know if this is this related to the Covid vaccine. This morning (unspecified date) he laid on the couch and he was about half scared to lay down because he was afraid something would happen again. The patient confirmed that he experienced this twice the day after or a couple days after the vaccine (unknown date). The patient stated that it has not happened again. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3302), intramuscular on 22Jan2021 15:10 at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml by intramuscular injection left shoulder) for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure (diagnosed about 21 years ago), ongoing gout (Diagnosed about 2 years ag), ongoing ankle spur right foot, ongoing diminished cartilage both knees, joint pain. The concomitant medications included torsemide. The patient reported adverse event (AE) after his first Pfizer-Biontech covid19 vaccine at 15:10  on 22Jan2021. He reported arm pain starting 3 hours after vaccination until noon the next day (23Jan2021). When he woke up on 23Jan2021 he reported lower back pain, that has migrated more to the right hip and into the glute. The pain inhibits walking, standing, etc. He did note that he is &gt;300lbs and has had joint pain in the past, but the hip pain is new. He also thought it might be kidney pain, as he takes a daily diuretic. He stated he has been treating with Aleve twice a day, but that walking is still very bad.  The patient is an optometrist that was calling about the Covid-19 vaccine and said that he did not know if the Lot number written on the vaccination card is EL3302, E13302, or EI3302. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and reported that he got a sore arm about 3 hours after receiving the injection. He woke up with a sore lower back pain. He is 5ft 9.5 and 310 lbs and he is on Torsemide, a pretty strong diuretic. He woke up with the back pain and stated that it moved right and middle to his buttocks, a little lower than the end of his spine and to the right. He did not think it was his kidneys. He said that Torsemide can make kidneys work overtime. His knees were pretty shot, the left worse than the right. No further details provided. He was upset to know that he has shrunk a 1.5 inches over the years. He has been taking 2 Aleve a day since Saturday, this morning was his 4th pill. He said that it is really odd when he stands equally on both feet his lower back hurts. He has to sleep on his right side and that it hurts more when he sleeps on his back and on his left side. He was fearful doing eye exams next to his patient and how the lower back pain would affect him.  Reporter considered seriousness for Lower back pain was Medically significant. The outcome of event lower back pain was not recovered; of event arm pain was recovered on 23Jan2021; of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event low back pain cannot be excluded. The ongoing gout and concomitant drug torsemide may also play contributory roles to the event.

                                                Approximately 1 week after the Pfizer dose I had a small lump and soreness over my right flank at the kidney level.  Over the next two days that pain migrated to my right buttock and radiated down my right leg.  With full weight applied to my right leg the leg had weakness and would occasionally buckle.  I am due for my second injection but am considering not taking the second injection fearing permanent nerve involvement.  As of today 2/23 the pain in my right leg and buttocks is lessened but still present.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

This morning the pain has dropped to my right buttock and is radiating down my right leg; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 71-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9264) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Feb2021 (at the age of 71-years-old), for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were no concomitant medications and no other vaccine was administered on the same date. Exactly one week after the injection, on 17Feb2021, the patient began having routine symptoms including weakness, tiredness, and chills. The unusual and unexpected symptom was a right flank pain that seemed to be over the right kidney. According to the patient, it seemed to be muscular, so he dismissed it. On the morning of 21Feb2021, the pain had dropped to his right buttock and was radiating down his right leg.

Per Emergency MD note: &#34;This is a 72-year-old male with what sounds like diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presents via EMS in cardiac arrest.  It sounds like he received his Covid vaccine last week.  Initially he had some mild effects from it.  However over the last day or so he has felt very unwell.  He apparently called his wife today and told her that he was not feeling well and so she returned home.  Shortly thereafter he attempted to get up from his chair.  He then collapsed and fell forward onto his face.  Sounds like his wife had some difficulty rolling him over to perform CPR.  When EMS arrived they found him in PEA.  He received a total of 5 rounds of epinephrine.  At some point they did have return of spontaneous circulation.  However just prior to arriving in the emergency department they lost pulses again.  The patient was intubated with an 8 oh endotracheal tube prior to arrival.&#34;

The medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the shot on 19Jan2021. Since Jan2021, his arm was still sore, but he had been nauseated since then. He has no energy. He has had it almost four days. He was fine until he got it and his arm is sore and he is nauseated. He is usually on the go. The patient also has an inflamed liver. He has been sick since. The patient has no appetite, he is sweating, his bones are hurting, and he is tired. The consumer took her husband to his doctor, and they tested him for COVID, and it came back negative, but the consumer does not think the PA did the test right. The consumer doesn&#39;t know what to do with him, because he is still tired, and has no appetite. The patient is breaking out in cold chills, and his bones are still sore. When the patient got the vaccine, he was walking and talking, and by 11 AM that day, he was in bed. The patient had some labs done, and was being told that his liver is big, so the consumer did not know if the vaccine went to his liver. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I called the health department and they told me to call my physician. I called my physician, he told me to call my health department. You know, I got frustrated.

ER or Hip Surgeon can find no reason, tell me I?ve strained my hip somehow. I?m at 2 weeks now, and can still not walk without severe pain and a walker. Wish I had never got the vaccine, and definitely won?t get the second vaccination!!!

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                DEATH Narrative:  Patient passed away after Covid Vaccine. 2/8/21: brought to the ER for evaluation for leg weakness and a recent fall associated. He was in a facility- per patient he fell when standing from the bed, he though he could do it and did not ask for help. He has been with hip and pelvic pain since then. The CT/XR shows evidence of lytic lesions, an IR bone biopsy was done and came positive for metastatic bladder carcinoma. 02/17/21: transferred to the facility for PT and pain management, originally for short stay rehab then changed to hospice care. 02/19/2021: received covid vaccine 03/05/21: discharged from facility on home hospice 03/23/21: pt passed away at home Patient with prior covid infection; tested positive last on 9/25/2020. Vaccine did not likely contribute to patient&#39;s death, as he was on hospice due to malignant cancer. No evidence of reaction immediately after vaccination or before date of death.

I then vomited 1 hour later and then every 30-60 minutes for the next 12 hours.  After the first 4 episodes of emesis, I was only vomiting bile.  I felt wiped out and very weak and slept when I wasn&#39;t vomiting.  On the 10th, I had generalized muscle aches but no more vomiting.  On the 11th, I am finally feeling better but not really normal yet.

By 3:00 p.m. That day he had soreness at the injection site and by 10:00 p.m. he noticed difficulty using his arms to the transfer.  There was particular difficulty with the proximal left upper extremity and bracing himself and he fell to the floor.  He feels that both arms are weaker since the injection.

No abdominal pain.  No vomiting or diarrhea.  No black or bloody stools.  No dizziness.  Today he almost fell and the son had to catch him.  He did not suffer any trauma.  He offers no symptoms of pain.  Here he is fully awake and alert.  Nothing to clinically suspect a stroke.  His vitals are stable.  Chest x-ray shows nothing acute.  Creatinine is better than baseline.  Electrolytes are stable.  Troponin reassuring.  He had no chest pain or shortness of breath to suspect angina.  Spoke to the wife via telephone, he is getting so weak that he was unable to walk.  Paramedics report they had lift him as he could not take a step.
