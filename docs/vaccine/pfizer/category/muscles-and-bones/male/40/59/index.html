Later that night, about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine, I experienced mild wheezing for less than 5 minutes, but believe this was likely due to allergies and associated postnasal drip rather than the vaccine.  The following day I had mild muscle soreness and injection site pain without swelling or redness.

A 40-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the arm on 07Jan2021 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included clonazepam. The patient had historical vaccine first dose of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced tiredness. On unspecified date, the consumer stated, &#34;I just want to, I didn&#39;t have, I was just little tired with the first shot I received. But I am little concerning on the second one like I woke up at the middle of the night, I got it yesterday at about 13:00. I woke up at about 2:00 in the morning on 08Jan2021 nd I couldn&#39;t even really move but then I was up for most of the night. My temperature is like  between 102.6 and 103.5 and my back hurts really bad. So, I am hoping that these are normal things but I am curious at any point is there something I should watch out for taking on that stuff further. The first shot was not anywhere near to bad which I know is to be expected but the second one being the worse, it&#39;s like dramatic, I have had a fever for I don&#39;t know like eighteen hours. Is there anything I should just make sure, or like this can be a normal side effect, correct?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 40-year-old male patient started to receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 21Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), COVID-19 in 2020 (Jun2020 or Jul2020; tested positive for COVID-19 at that time and has 3 tests after that which were all negative) and since then lost weight (2020), and root canal. The patient had no issues with vaccines in the past. There were issues with the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, because he would be positive to TB, but this is because of his culture, he is from a specific country, and so they cannot take that vaccine. The patient clarified that he did not take the TB vaccine, what he meant was he is aware he can&#39;t take it. On 21Dec2020, the patient works in healthcare and had a patient that came in that tested positive for COVID-19 and so because of that, everyone including him that came in contact with the COVID-19 positive patient had to check and get tested. This happened the same day as his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the test (Dec2020) came out negative. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had not had any antibody test for COVID-19. The patient asked the doctor, but she never scheduled him for that, until after last month, she talked to him about it, but by that time he told her that he doesn&#39;t need it now - it&#39;s been almost a year. The patient had the first dose on 21Dec2020 and at that time he did experience symptoms the next day (22Dec2020). At that time after the first dose administration (21Dec2020), he could not lift his arm and it was bruised under the arm. The next day (22Dec2020), he had back pain, with his neck he could not turn it (neck pain), he could not be on his left side where he got the shot on left arm, it was like that for 3 days. Then on Thursday (24Dec2020), he had headache every time he bended his head down, he would be sleeping and would wake up in middle of night because of the headache, it felt like a sinus headache on one side of the head, and when he bend his head down, he would feel it, it stayed this way till 29Dec2020 (Tuesday). The patient has a question trying to find out with his employer. They told them they need to take the vaccine, they pushed them to take the vaccine, he works in healthcare. If they get sick at the job, he asked if they (employer) would pay for it, how would he get paid. The job told him he gets paid sick days and asked how they would do that. The patient asked how long the vaccine was alive in the body and how does it work. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I had practically no side effects from shot #1....shot #2 was different. Starting about 6-8hrs after injection I started to feel lethargic. By 10hrs, I started with varying chills/sweats that lasted all night, injection site soreness, and soreness in left breast area. The next day I was extremely exhausted and had trouble staying awake. Muscle aches in both shoulders and neck. Also had varying fever from 100 up to 104.1 throughout the day. At 36hrs after injection. I took 2 Advil to help with the muscle aches...nothing taken to this point. 48hrs After injection some energy returned, but still lethargic throughout the day, and occasion fever between 100-101. During shower, I noticed swelling under my left armpit, not present on the right side. At 60hrs after injection, fever gone, energy returned...lingering soreness of left shoulder and breast area and swelling under left armpit remains.  At no point did I have any breathing or lung issues...but otherwise it felt like I had a bad flu (minus the coughing/wheezing) for 2 days.

                                                When I woke up the morning after I receive the vaccine, it was very painful to move my left arm. The pain increased if I moved my arm greater than perpendicular to my body. The worst pain though with with my back. I could not stand up straight without a sharp pain starting in my lower back. I was also extremely tired. So I called into work took some Tylenol and went back to bed. By 1 o?clock that afternoon I had felt fine as if nothing had ever happened.

                                                Starting at 8pm on vaccination day I got loopy and disoriented, and had a hard time speaking intelligibly.  I also had trouble with balance and fine motor skills.  Had some personality changes too: became very moody with erratic mood swings. The next day I slept all day because of exhaustion and aches. When I woke up on Wednesday (36hrs later) I was literally screaming in pain because of how bad my arm and shoulder hurt. It hurt to move it, and hurt not to move it.  It was excruciating and ibuprofen didn&#39;t seem to help at all. Throughout Wednesday I could hardly move my left arm. Getting dressed or washing my hair was very difficult and very painful.  I was also still very uncoordinated. My left armpits lymph nodes were so swollen that (1) it filled in my entire armpit so there was no more pit, just a very soft bulge, and (2) the fluid extended all the way to my chest and it looked like I had one breast and one pec.

The first day, following the shot, I had a bit of soreness at the injection site but it was gone by the following day, Friday, 3/26/21. I had a general feeling of weakness the afternoon and into the night on the day of the shot as well. However, it was about midday or a bit after the following day that I began feeling obvious side effects. These include, primarily, a general feeling of being ill. Headache (but that&#39;s not that abnormal &amp; body aches and stiffness similar to a mild version of influenza. It appeared late in the day on Saturday, 3/27/21 and has continued since.

                                                gout flare-up that existed prior to vaccine #1 and was not fully resolved.  After vaccine dose 1, one day following is why pain was exacerbated.  After a tapered dosage of prednisone and combination with colchicine, the flare never fully went away prior to vaccine dose 2.  Again, a day following the vaccine, pain was exacerbated to a point where I could not even walk and had to take the day off from work.  I have stated another dosage of prednisone and pain level is manageable.  There is no coincidence that the flare never went away and that it got worse both times a day following the the vaccines.  It does not appear to trigger new flares, but if a flare existed prior to taking the vaccine, it causes some pretty serious inflammatory response.

                                                Ii got he vaccinator on 3/5 and went home.  the first night around 9p, I started to feel chills, Had a really big temporal headache.  I thought it was a reaction to vaccination, I took Tylenol PM, layer down and woke up in the middle of the night, in a full body sweat.  I went strait into chills, changed my clothes.  Layed back own and awoke the next morning, with chills and temp of 101.  I had body ache but proceeded with my day.  I continued to have chills, I went out to my elderly parents, took them food and had dinner.  Upon arrival home, had high fever 103...no Tylenol.  Awoke still w/ chills and high fever and this was Sunday.  Stayed in Sunday then the afternoon, felt like I needed to seek help.  I went to get a rapid test at Medical Center and it came back Neg.  Went back home, I could now sense that my taste was altered.  I then continued to have a high fever but they would only come at night.  Body sweat, aches, chills cont&#39;d on Sunday.  Monday still had same s/s and Tuesday, I thought that I should seek more medical attention.  I went to an Urgent Care 3/9/21.  They then did a nose swab and felt that it would come back Neg.  I went home and on Thursday 3/11/2021 I got a call that I was positive.  Did isolate.  But from 3/5 to 3/11 then I lost taste/smell.  Came out of isolation 3/20 and on 3/21 my whole left side of fact, shoulder and leg went numb for approx 1hr.  Then my wife said that I was talking a little slow in my response.  Next morning my left shoulder was hurting and I had pain.  The Urgent care provider wanted to r/o TIA  so he sent me to ER for full work up and that doctor said he saw nothing.  He didi say that it could be Covid related and/or possible TIA.  &#34;I am feeling good today&#34;  There is no residual but because of the left shoulder pain I did go back to Urgent Care.  Got cortisone inject and MRI.  My PCP then told me that I had a partial &#34;tear&#34; in my left shoulder but I do exercise every day and could have done it then.

                                                Woke up fine around 6am. As I was moving around, I noticed at about 6:45am that my neck was getting stiff. Within 15-30 minutes my neck could barely move without pain. My head also noticeable was leaning to my right side. My upper back, should blade area became tight and I couldn&#39;t really use my arms without having pain in the area. I went home and laid down on a heating pad. I couldn&#39;t even flinch without pain in the area. As the afternoon went on, it got a little better. I took Ibuprofen which helped a little. The next day it was slightly better. Today is 4/29, almost a week later and it&#39;s still not 100%. My neck is stiff. The right side where my shoulder blade ends is in a lot of pain. I can&#39;t really lift anything.

Additionally, I couldn&#39;t breath - it was very painful to attempt to fully fill my lungs. This condition lasted for about 45 minutes as I tried changing positions in bed to make the pain change (either worse or less) but it was consistent and would not go away.  At that time my wife and I thought I may have been having a heart attack so we went to the Emergency Room.

The symptoms were so bad I stayed home from work on 1/12/21.  Over the next few days the rash improved and the headache slowly went away

A 41-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand Pfizer/BioNTech, lot EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 28Dec2020 11:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) and PFO (patent foramen ovale). He had no known drug allergy. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]. On 10Jan2021, he began having mild headaches. On 11Jan2021 the headaches worsened to about 4/10 associated with myalgias, neck stiffness and a diffuse pruritic rash over his whole body. To return to work he had to go get tested so he went to the ER, got Flu A/B test, Covid antigen, then PCR test, a CBC, CMP, and coags (to rule out ITP). All tests were normal, Nasal Swab was negative. Treatment given was Normal saline bolus and ketorolac 30mg IV. The outcome of events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  ~~~

                                                Initial adverse events: night sweats, fever, body aches, muscle aches (Back pain).  These all occurred about 12 hours after the second shot and subsided around 36 hours after the second shot.  8.5 days after the second shot I had throat and chest pain.  This pain then continued and got worse to the point I went to the ER and was evaluated for potential heart attack.  After testing - results were that I did not have a heart attack.  I was still experiencing this pain, so the ER took a strep test.  This was also negative.  The diagnosis was &#34;pulled chest muscle&#34;.  I&#39;ve had pulled muscles, I know what those feel like and it sure didn&#39;t feel like what I experienced on the night of the 16th and the day of the 17th of Feb. 2021.

I have had back pain before over the years from my job.  However, this pain was the worst its been and lasted more than 2 weeks.  I saw a chiropractor to help with the symptoms.  They have gotten much better, but are still there.   I also noticed that my right and left index finger were swollen and stiff in the knuckle closet to my hand.

By 4:15pm, I was experience acute lower back pain that made it difficult to stand up.  The pain continued for the rest of the evening.  By the morning of Saturday March 13th, the pain had subsided to a tolerable level.  By the morning of Sunday March 14th, the pain subsided even further.  It is now Wednesday March 17th and the pain is not gone although it is much reduced.  I attempted to get an appointment with my PCP to discuss the wisdom of getting (or not getting) the 2nd shot on April 2nd but so far I have been unsuccessful in getting an appointment due to scheduling limitations at the office.

                                                Dose 1: Severe headache for the next day, minor pain and moderate stiffness of R arm over the next 24 hours.  I am *not* submitting this report for the first dose.  Dose 2: Moderate headache over next day, mild fatigue over next day, moderate joint pain over next day, same discomfort/stiffness of R arm.    The one thing I wanted to report was my L shoulder.   I had pulled/torn it around Wednesday of the week and it hurt quite a bit when I put it in the wrong position, but it was otherwise fine.   However, post-second Pfizer shot, the pain in my L shoulder easily double or tripped for some reason as a reaction to the vaccine.   Basically, Friday before the shot, my should hurt a little bit but had been getting progressively better.  But post-second Pfizer shot, the same area that had mild pain before now felt like I had been stabbed in the shoulder or that I had re-torn the muscle and had done so in a significantly worse way.     It&#39;s not a big thing, but you may want to start asking people if they&#39;ve recently had any muscle injuries prior to vaccination.  I&#39;m now ~30 hours post vaccine and it is decreasing in pain, but the shot obviously had some type of impact on what bruising/swelling/tearing of my L shoulder that I had.  (Note that both vaccine shots were to the R arm and the L should was not related to that in any way.)

Fever - Started the night of my vaccine increasing to 102.4 and reaching the highest on the second day at 103.5.  I took ibuprofen every 6 hours for two days straight with it staying steady at above 100. Nausea - Started the evening of the vaccine and got very severe.  It has continued for 4 days. Fast Heartbeat - It has stayed consistently above 110  and sometime getting up to 130 while laying in bed shivering.

A 41-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN- reported as misplace/discarded), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm (at the age of 40 years) on 21Dec2020 at 12:15 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no patient medical history. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. There were no concomitant medications (no medications within 2 weeks prior to vaccination). The patient did not received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. On 21Dec2020 at 14:30, 2.5 hours after the vaccine, the patient had steadily increasing headache, muscle ache, weakness and feverish. He took 250mg Tylenol. At 5.5 hours after the vaccine, his headache was so severe that he went to the Emergency Department of the facility he works in. Treatment for the adverse event included 1gram Tylenol, IV with saline and another drug (unspecified). The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 24Mar2021, post vaccination, he was tested for COVID-19 via nasal swab with a positive result. The outcome of headache, muscle ache, weakness and feverish was recovered. The outcome of COVID-19 was unknown.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.

                                                A few hours after my 2nd shot I got dizzy then a headache. My arm hurt too, quite a bit. The next morning I woke up with a fever of 101.5 and kept that fever for 2 more days. I felt weak, dizzy, but the physical pain was the worst. My head was pounding, my neck, back, and legs all hurt. That passed after a day except the headache. 3 days later I still have a low fever, headache, but mostly dizziness. I&#39;ve never been seriously ill in my life. Ive never been sick enough to get antibiotics prescribed. I eat healthy, don&#39;t drink or smoke. This vaccine floored me though. Like getting run over by a truck.

ER doctor felt body?s immune response was over-working due to the vaccine immune response and possibly pollen allergy I may have experienced right after getting the vaccine. No prescription meds give. Advised to take Meclizine 25mg and Zyrtec. Below are the symptoms experienced on 4/10:  ? Lightheadedness/Sudden Jerking body movements when triggered/passing out momentarily for a second when taking strain/not in my elements ? Feeling extremely fatigued. Did not sleep well at night on 4/8 and 4/9 ? Head feels Intoxicated, foggy, lightheaded, as if stuffed with cotton candy. Startled when unexpected things happen like a sudden jerking movement along with momentary passing out while anything unexpected happens. E.g., when I am pushing myself on the sofa to re-position, I feel my whole body is turning off for a second. Simply does not feel normal ? Rubbery legs ? Worsens after shower. I feel like I need to lay down as the foggy feeling worsens after shower ? Lightheadedness. Losing control sometimes. ? I am easily startled when climbing down the stairs - no Depth perception. ? Don?t have the strength to blow nose or cough. Feels like momentary fainting when doing these activities ? Dis-equilibrium. Whole body is twitching when something unexpected happens to my senses. ? Unable to control while laughing feels like momentary faint. I have felt like this when I was down with a fever. Tickled easily ? Difficulty pulling myself out of bed. Felt like muscle was giving away ? Tingling feeling in the right abdomen area ? Difficulty staying alert or focused and random rather unpleasant thoughts constantly coming to mind. Felt a bit of panic attack.  4/11 ? Went to PCP. Body weakness and fatigue got worse. PCP did blood sugar test and flushed out the left ear. Ordered Brain MRI to see if structurally anything was wrong. Brain MRI came out OK as well however noticed minor sinusitis. Prescribed Amoxicillin antibiotics and nasal spray. Referred me to Neurologist and Head and Neck Specialist.  4/11 ? 4/15 - Above symptoms progressively got worse. Especially weakness in the arms and shoulders. Arms quivered every time trying to stand up and felt like fainting. Hand-eye coordination progressively got worse. For e.g., could not pick up water bottle, hands were quivering badly  4/15 ? Neurologist conducted certain diagnostic tests and concluded that there are no neurological issues. Said with rest and plenty of fluids it should get better. Spinal tap was not recommended and said if symptoms got worse a spinal tap can be done during the next visit. Follow up visit with neurologist scheduled on 4/27  4/15 ? 4/27 ? Weakness in arms got better. Arm strength and coordination has improved however it?s still not back to normal. Brain fog and dizziness still persists with no improvement. Left limb and arms are stronger than the left. Difficulty climbing up and down stairs. Dizziness worsens after shower. Not feeling myself. In addition, not able to multitask - getting startled and need to be deliberate about having to do everyday chores need to just focus on one task 100% completely and if something else comes up then my body just goes into a momentary shock. Mostly I can feel my head feeling heavy and my eyelids shutting down when something shocking happens ? a feeling like body is ?turning off?, almost a fainting or passing out feeling. Sometimes when I turn to one side and sleep, I can feel a flickering sensation in the ear. Still always feeling woozy and as if there is something in my head ? a medicated or intoxicated feeling in the head  4/27 ? Neurologist said she sees a lot of improvement and reiterated again that I don?t have any neurological issues. She said I can go back to work starting 5/1. She said I may have Conversion Disorder / Disequilibrium. It?s hard for me to fathom why she would diagnose me with Conversion Disorder when so many people are reporting very similar symptoms that I am facing on the below forum: https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/dizziness-among-common-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/  4/30 ? Next appointment with Head and Neck / Audiology

Started my work day from home with a meeting at 0900 and knew by 0920 that I had to take the day off.   Spent the entire rest of the day and night in bed. Fever peaked at 101.1F , nausea, constant headache, shaking chills and then sweats, extreme fatigue and full body severe muscle soreness. Light headed and very weak.  I slept all day until almost 1500. When I woke up my fever was gone. I&#39;m left tonight feeling hungry again along with some residual sore muscles and aches.  The fever responded well to Ibuprofen. I hydrated with water and Gatorade.  It pretty much felt like influenza for just under 48 hours. I feel like I&#39;m past the worst of it now, but I&#39;m not fully recovered.

                                                On April 18 and 19, following my 2nd injection, I had very bad chills and could not get warm. I was nauseous although I did not vomit. On April 22, I began having severe sharp stabbing pains just to the right of my belly button. It felt like I was being stabbed with a very hot knife, and after about 15-90 seconds, it would go away. Anytime I reached for something, bent over, twisted, turned or tried to hug someone, I would get this same pain and it would double me over in pain.  On Monday April 26 at 7pm, I finally checked into the Emergency Room  at the direction of my Primary Doctor.  They did a bunch of blood work on me and sent me for a CT Scan of my abdomen.  All of the blood work came back in normal ranges, and the CT Scan showed my appendix was &#34;borderline&#34; according to the surgeon. They consulted with Dr and decided to admit me for a surgical consult and further examination.  They gave me fluids and morphine through an IV for the first 24 - 36 hrs, and then switched to Norco by mouth. I continued having pain throughout my stay.  On Thursday, April 29, they took me to surgery for &#34;exploratory surgery&#34; with the intention of removing my appendix and looking around to see if anything else stood out to them that would cause me this pain.  They stated my appendix had scar tissue on it and they removed it, but said they did not know if this would stop the pain I was having.  On Friday April 30, I was released from the hospital at approximately 6pm.  By 9pm on Friday, I began having those same sharp, stabbing, burning pains in my abdomen again, now to the right of my belly button again and further towards my right side.  I also had sharp burning pain in the inside of my upper right arm, between my bicep and tricep muscles.  This pain continued on through the weekend occurring more frequently and more severe.  On Monday morning at about 1:30am, I woke up with severe abdominal pains all over and went into the bathroom.  I had diarrhea and nausea and felt like I was going to vomit.  Between 1:30am and 7:30am, I went to the bathroom 6 times.  I went to work on Monday and continued having abdominal pains and diarrhea all day and night.  On Tuesday, I went to the bathroom a total of 17 times. On Wednesday, I saw my primary Dr.,  who examined my abdomen and pains.  He suggested I take immodium for the diarrhea and a supplement for muscle pain, as he felt this was the cause of my pain. On Wednesday, I went to the bathroom 21 times and was very nauseaus.  I started the Imodium and it had no effect on me whatsoever.  On Thursday, I had to call off work because I couldn&#39;t stop using the bathroom.  By 4pm, I had been to the bathroom 18 times.  I returned to the ER.  They took a stool sample and did an ultrasound in the ER.  They decided to admit me again for surgical consult and pain management.  On Friday, Dr ordered another ultrasound of my abdomen, specifically my gallbladder, kidney, and liver.  He also sent me for a CT Scan with contrast.  They completed a total lab workup of my blood.  All of these results came back normal, and nothing on the images showed anything wrong with my organs.   On Saturday May 8, Dr came to the hospital to examine me. He stated everything related to my GI was fine.  He asked if I have back pain, which I told him I do.  At this time, I was in extreme pain and I couldn&#39;t even touch my skin. Dr attempted to examine my abdomen, and just by placing his hand on my stomach, I screamed in pain.  He then put his hand behind my back and pushed a little, and it cause extreme pain in my abdomen.  At this time, Dr suggested that maybe the pain is caused by something going on in my back.  Maybe a pinched nerve or something.  He ordered an X-ray of my upper and lower spine.  Later that day, the results of the X-ray came back and showed there was nothing wrong with my spine.  With these results, Dr then ordered an MRI of my lumbar and thoracic spine.  On Sunday May 9 at 1030am, I was taken to radiology for an MRI.  The initial report shows that I do not have any pinched nerves and nothing notable that would cause this type of pain in my body.   As of now, no diagnosis or explanation for the pain I am experiencing. The pain is gradually getting worse and at times I am unable to move at all without extreme severe pain in my body.  At times, my right groin hurts and I am unable to stand on my feet, as it feels as if I have pulled a groin muscle.  The pain in my abdomen takes my breath away and feels like I am being set on fire in that area of my body.  The pain no longer goes away and is constant, but moves throughout my right side from my groin to my shoulder only.  I am not able to put my right arm behind my back because I get this pain in the back of my shoulder area.  This pain is only on my right side at this time.  So far, there is no explanation for this pain.  I never had anything like this until I got the vaccine.

A 41-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL9262; Expiration Date: 31May2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 07Feb2021 (at the age of 41-years-old) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications was not reported. The reporter said the first day he didn&#39;t feel anything. The caller states that on the second day after getting the vaccine, arm at the injection site was sore and neck stiff on 08Feb2021. Caller states that the Tuesday after his vaccine, he was fine most of the day but in the afternoon the patient experienced nerve pain from his ulnar nerve to his elbow and his hand and it came around to his chest, and his chest was on fire and his abdomen and his hip and foot on 09Feb2021. Caller woke up the next day with no pain, but his left arm was weak. Caller states that the day after that, everything seemed fine except whenever he uses his left arm, the triceps and armpit still hurt. Caller was scheduled for his second dose this coming Sunday, and he was wondering what the recommendations are for getting the second dose with having had symptoms like this following the first dose. Caller reported that the pain to the injection site on his left arm has resolved but he is still having nerve pain in his left arm.  It was stated that nerve pain that right now it did not hurt, but if he were to use his arm, and do labor, that was when the nerve pain flare ups. Caller states that when he was resting it was good, but when he uses his arm, it flares up. Caller states the nerve pain was persisting, because it was not worse, but it was not going away. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: everything was good on Nov2020 everything was good. Outcome of the event (nerve pain from his ulnar nerve to his elbow and his hand and it came around to his chest, and his chest was on fire and his abdomen and his hip and foot) was not recovered, arm at the injection site was sore was recovered on an unspecified date and neck stiff was recovered on 10Feb2021.   Follow-up attempts completed. No further information expected.

Couldn&#39;t do any physical activity without immediately becoming out of breath (normally very healthy and active). Heart would race unpredictably, reaching 120 bpm (normal resting for me is 60-70). General malaise. Felt more like 80 years old than 40. Was unable to do normal physical activity and work for weeks.  Feeling better overall, but still sometimes feel like I get tired unusually easily and heart behaves strangely now and then.

                                                Muscular pain in both upper arms well after initial vaccine reaction had subsided, normal movement of arm up and/or back and rapid movements in other axes cause intense muscle pain followed by severe minutes of pain fading to dull ache. The pain issue has only worsened since it&#39;s onset. The pain in each arm is proportionate to the initial vaccine reaction, meaning the arm that got the second dose experiences more sever pain than the one that got the first. The pain in both is preventing normal activities and affecting quality of life.

A 42-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 (at the age of 42-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications were reported as none. On an unspecified date (&#34;roughly&#34; 6 hours after the vaccine was administered) the patient experienced &#34;muscle ache&#34;, &#34;chills&#34;, &#34;headache is so severe most disturbing one; it was getting too bad, my head want to fall off, I could not work&#34; and &#34;left arm is too sore way it was administered&#34;. The patient reported that he called &#34;because he took the COVID-19 vaccine last night and he had been having reactions from last time till this time&#34; (as reported). The patient stated that there was no doctor that prescribed the medication, it was administered to him because he was a healthcare worker (certified nursing assistant). He stated that he had been having &#34;muscle ache, chills and severe headache, the headache is so severe, the most disturbing one.&#34; He reported that one of the Tylenol doses was administered to him by the nurse that administered the vaccine. He reported that he took some Tylenol and ibuprofen but this time it was not helping. He stated that he received the vaccine about 24 hours ago and started to experience muscle ache, chills and severe headache roughly about 6 hours after the administration. He reported that &#34;I could hang in, but it was getting too bad, my head wanted to fall off, so I am driving home now so I could not work.&#34; When the patient was asked about the vaccine dose and route he stated &#34;I believe normal dose I believe, I cannot remember I cannot recap anything, but I know it was administered in my left arm, my left arm is too sore the way it was administered.&#34; He stated that he received the vaccination for prevention and to be on the safe side. The patient stated that he did lab work with his doctor a few months ago, probably around 6 or 7 months ago. The clinical outcome of the events &#34;muscle ache&#34;, &#34;chills&#34;, &#34;headache is so severe most disturbing one; it was getting too bad, my head want to fall off, I could not work&#34; were all not recovered/not resolved, while the clinical outcome of the event &#34;left arm is too sore way it was administered&#34; was unknown.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Went to ED 6 days after vaccination.  &#34;42yoM with a hx of covid-19 infection in 3/2020 with sequelae of chest pain, insomnia, SIBO, and distant hx of testicular malignancy who presents with chest pain and chest palpitations.  Pt received COVID vaccine on Monday, then started to have symptoms reminiscent of his original covid infection on Wednesday, including chills, myalgias, substernal chest pain, heart palpitations, and fatigue. Denies any fevers recorded at home. He feels like he has extra beats intermittently. Also reports some nausea, but denies vomiting or diarrhea. He has maintained good PO intake since symptoms started, but is worried he may be a bit dehydrated because he had a small AKI when he had covid back in March?.  Etiology of chest pains unclear, but given all of the above workup, unlikely to be due to an acute cardiac or pulmonary etiology.&#34;  He continued to have palpitations for the next week and had further EKG&#39;s don thru urgent care.

                                                Approximately 10 days following the vaccine, I began to feel mild weakness in my right hand and wrist.  The vaccine had been administered in my right arm.  Over the next two to three weeks I have noticed some additional weakness in both my right and left arms and also my neck muscles.  It is currently mild in nature, but a few days ago I had a little difficulty lifting myself out of bed.  I also notice the weakness after driving in the car for a while when my arms are in a somewhat horizontal position holding the steering wheel.  The weakness in my neck muscles is particularly noticeable in the evening and has caused some fatigue.    I have not noticed any significant weakness in the lower body nor have I experienced any additional symptoms.  Notably, I was scheduled to receive the second dose of the Pfizer  COVID19 vaccine on February 5, 2021, but have delayed it and rescheduled it to February 11, 2021

He normally has class on Saturday from 9-noon but he had to cancel going with the amount of fatigue he was experiencing. He also had some cognitive fuzziness on Jan2021. His fatigue was still there, but it has gotten a little better. He was normally very high energy, but he missed two classes and skipped his internship today. He doesn&#39;t feel like himself. He also has had frequent urination which he noticed probably Friday night (29Jan2021), all the way up until now. However, he has been drinking a lot of water.

The outcome of soreness at the point of administration of his left arm and Frequent urination was not recovered; Muscle soreness/muscle soreness at the point of injection spread to his whole body and fatigue was recovering; it was like aches all over his body and cognitive fuzziness was unknown.

                                                30-35 minutes after injection, while I was driving home, I felt some minor difficulty swallowing., but no impediment to breathing or speaking.  I rerouted to a plaza with a grocery store and urgent care clinic, and bought some Benadryl and took it at about 2:55PM.  I waited 20 minutes in the parking lot before deciding I was safe to drive home. When I read about the possibility of a biphasic reaction, where my throat could close up again later, I went to a Clinic (5:40PM walk-in appointment with NP), and they could not treat me, and advised me to go to the Emergency Room. I initially decided to just go home, but went to the Emergency Room out of an abundance of caution at around 7PM.  Dr.  gave me a prescription for an epi pen and prednisone, just in case symptoms worsened.  They did not, and I did not use either drug.  The throat swelling started around 2:45PM and worsened for about half an hour. It remained steady (no airway constriction, no difficulty taking pills or drinking water) without getting worse, and started to subside around 5PM.  By the time I woke up this morning (3/31), I don&#39;t think there is any lingering swelling.  I can feel a very slight lump in my throat, but I can&#39;t tell if that is a very small amount of residual swelling or just hyper-vigilance based on yesterday&#39;s experience.  Note: This swelling feeling is identical to my memory of what I felt when I was diagnosed as allergic to penicillin in 2000 or 2001. Back then, the only &#34;treatment&#34; was to immediately stop taking penicillin (and to never take it again), based on a phone call with my doctor&#39;s office.  I did have a strong immune response after that (102° fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain), but I don&#39;t consider that an adverse reaction.  This report is focused on what appeared to be a mild anaphylactic reaction.

                                                I had a strange feeling in the left side of my face that I wasn&#39;t sure if it was a reaction or not.  It happened within the first 15 minutes but did not last more than 30 minutes.  I did not experience anything else until the first evening when my arm was very sore.  The next day my arm was more sore and I had a mild circular red mark around the injection site and the arm was much harder on that side.  I also felt a little in my back and neck.  By the second day in the evening the only thing I felt was pain in the arm which eventually traveled into my armpit by day 3.  It wasn&#39;t until day 5 that all the pain was completely gone.  I may have experienced fatigue the first two days also.

                                                Joints became sore and right foot very tight the night following shot (4/3/2021).  Pain continued to build following day (4/3/2021 aka Easter).  By 9:30 PM on the night of 4/3 the large right toe had swollen and was unable to move.  By the morning of 4/4/2021 no pressure could be placed on the right foot without extreme pain.  Pain reached highest pain by 4/7/2021 and has slowly tapered but remains.  Swelling has reduced to point where a lose shoe can be placed over foot and some walking can occur with effort.   Joint pain continues in shoulders, knees and hips.  I become winded after walking only a few hundred feet.  (typically jog 2 miles/day and walk an additional 5 miles)

Went to hospital on Sunday morning when I woke up since left side of face was completely numb. Diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy.

                                                Experienced pain in lower back, lower spine area one day after shot #1.  That went away after about a week. After second dose (3 weeks after 1st one), I had no side effects until a few days after when I got the same lower back / spine aching and pain.  About a week and a half after second dose, the lower back pain moved to my left hip area and red spots appeared shortly after (a day or two after the hip pain).  The spots on my left hip and butt area started to burn and feel irritated...  I had mild aching in my pelvis area and lower back (spine) a few days after the shot and still today.  I went to the doctor 2 days ago and am currently being treated for shingles.  I am a runner, and ever since I got the 1st covid vaccine shot, my running performance has been worse... my pace per mile is about 20% worse (consistently) since the 1st shot.  I feel like it did something to my immune system and am still getting over it.

                                                About six hours after receiving my shot, my arm became extremely sore, as to be expected.  Circa 9pm I began to have  significant trouble breathing, experienced acute pain in my abdomen, and began to hear ringing in my ears combined with feeling like I was going to pass out. I didn?t feel dizzy, rather I started getting tunnel vision that blocked out more of my field of view as the ringing increased.  Circa 11pm, I lost consciousness while trying to move and collapsed on the floor. My wife called 911 while I was unresponsive, and I regained consciousness while being attended to by EMTs who checked my vitals. Around 12am I didn?t feel like I was going to lose consciousness again, and the EMTs recommended I be taken to the hospital. Since I was feeling better I politely declined.   Today I am still feeling foggy and have joint pain (in addition to some bruising from falling after losing consciousness , but I no longer have the acute abdominal pain.

                                                Developed severe ongoing pain in left shoulder and arm which has persisted to current date. I had minor pain prior to second vaccination but beginning in the hours immediately following the second dose it became much worse. It migrates throughout the arm and shoulder throughout the day. I am taking prescription pain medication and muscle relaxers for the first time in my life. I could not go to work for 5 days, I now can make it through the day with heavy medication. I have also been prescribed physical therapy for 7 more weeks.

                                                At first it was a lot of joint and muscle pain all over, and then I got shingles by the weekend. I thought they were bug bites and I wasn&#39;t sure where all the pain was coming from and I ended up in the emergency room where I was diagnosed with shingles. After my second shot I started getting shingles by laterally on my right side, but I was already on medication so it didn&#39;t get that bad. I also have a lot of joint pain and burning pain in my hands and wrists that shoot up my arms and haven&#39;t stopped since the symptoms started. It&#39;s much worse at night and keeps me up from sleeping. I have also have been very forgetful and my mind is always cloudy.

                                                Most, if not all, of my pain from my lower back surgery was gone. 1 week after the shot I started having pain in my left sciatic nerve again. It isn&#39;t as bad as it was but definitely painful. The upper back pain has came back and isn&#39;t terrible painful but is uncomfortable. Pain in most of my joints: knees, elbow, fingers... Most noticeable in my knees. (I weigh 150 pounds). I have been tired a lot. I did not have any issues with the bells palsy in my face. I received allergy shots for years and stopped getting them when I had surgery. After the surgery, I started getting the allergy shots again, it made me swell and my back pains were increased because of it. So I stopped getting them. So the issue may be that the COVID shot is making me swell.

A 42-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EW0172, Expiration Date 31Aug2021) via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Apr2021 at 09:00 (at the age of 42-years-old) as a single dose in the left &#34;shoulder&#34; for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were denied (reported as &#34;He has no medical conditions and does not take any regular medications&#34;). The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the vaccine. The reporter says she is reporting on behalf of her husband with regard to the Pfizer COVID vaccination. She just wanted to report that her husband got the first shot 28Apr2021 and Friday 07May2021 he was admitted to the hospital with 3 pulmonary embolisms. When asked when the pulmonary embolism began she says the week before the hospitalization, so the week he actually got the first dose, he was complaining of the back of his leg hurting, in the upper calf area. She says it was either the day after the shot or the next day that he said his leg hurt but he did not think too much about it and it resolved after a couple days and then Wednesday, 05 May 2021 he started getting discomfort in his left upper quadrant, she clarifies his abdomen and rib cage area, and he started having really bad headaches Thursday that continued and during the night  Thursday night his left shoulder started bothering him and it was radiating from his shoulder up to his chin as well as he had the severe headache so the doctor told him to go to the ER. The patient experienced three pulmonary embolisms on an unspecified date with outcome of not recovered. The patient was hospitalized for 3 pulmonary embolisms from 07May2021 to 08May2021. He also started having really bad headaches on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown and he was complaining of the back of his leg hurting on an unspecified date with outcome of recovered, his left shoulder started bothering him and it was radiating from his shoulder up to his chin on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. The reporter commented that she and her husband wanted to report this because of the timing of getting the shot and they are waiting now to go see his primary care they are supposed to be calling to set up an appointment because he is supposed to be having the second dose 19May2021 so they do not know what is going to happen. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pulmonary embolism and included Eliquis which he would be on for at least 3 months.

Felt ok on and off - but in the evening felt moderate vertigo multiple times.  Went to ER and physician judged either BPPV or vestibular neuritis or something similar. No prior vestibular history or tinnitus experience. It seemed to resolve after 2-3 days of meclizine. Then again on May 22, it started and continues where on adn off vertigo and dizziness persists. Meclizine is not very effective. Hoping I feel better soon. Have an appt with PCP on Friday. Feel some neck ache occasionally. and a bit of full ear

I didn?t sleep well and woke up with the same bad pain from my elbow to my shoulder and also my shoulder blade to my neck and head.  Most of the symptoms were gone after 48 hrs.

Since then I have experience knee joint pain every time I ride a bicycle.  I have tried adjusting bike fit on my own and with professional bike fit.  I have tried rides on older bike whose fit never gave me any problems for years including many longer rides.  I found an article detailing a woman who experienced ReA(Reactive Arthritis) after receiving Covid-19 vaccination and thought my symptoms might be similar.

Woke up on left side so just assumed hand was asleep.  After 15 minutes of no improvement,  I started to panic thinking I was having a stroke.   Realizing I had no other symptoms and was feeling fine otherwise I knew that likely wasn&#39;t the case. Besides having zero strength (I did have feeling) my hand would curl inward toward my body.  I could manipulate with my right hand by it would always curl back in. I was barely able to grip, would actually have to manipulate my fingers into a grasp, couldn&#39;t do it on it&#39;s own, and holding something as light as my cellphone would cause my hand to turn down towards the floor. Pain level I would only describe as soreness in my wrist and elbow.  Annoying but not painful. It&#39;s now over 24 hours since symptoms first appeared and besides some slight weakness in the hand I would say I&#39;m 95% better.

                                                myositis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 43-year-old male patient received  first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown) on an unspecified date in Dec2020 reported as around the end of December,  at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date after he received the vaccine he had right arm pain and swelling (states it was in his bicep brachial radialis in the muscle) which is the opposite arm of the injection site. He had an MRI done on an unknown date that showed myositis. He thinks could be due to the vaccine since it started two days after he received the vaccine. His pain peaked at about a week and a half and now the pain was improving and the swelling was down. He still had function in the right arm but when he strained it would hurt. His concern was that the reaction may be an autoimmune reaction and the first response was muted. He was worried the second dose may elicit a larger response. At the time of the reporting the patient was recovering from the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between the myositis and vaccination with BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. Additional information regarding onset latency, relevant medical history, concomitant medications and detailed clinical course around the event onset will aid in comprehensive assessment of the case. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I woke the following morning and felt no residual symptoms.

A 43-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer COVID 19; lot number: EL3247; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 17Jan2021 09:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known penicillin allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (BACTRIM) but had allergies. The patient historically vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer COVID 19; lot number: EL0140; expiration date: unknown) at the age of 43-year-old via an unspecified route of administration right arm on 29Dec2020 10:00 AM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient received the vaccine in a hospital but 36 hours after the vaccine (18Jan2021), the patient developed chills, body aches and low-grade temperature. Then 48 hours later, her left axilla has become very swollen and painful. The pain has subsided but remains mild and swelling persists. The area seems to show fluid accumulation in the subcutaneous tissue but no erythema or e/o [evidence of (pending confirmation)] abscess infection noted. It&#39;s now been present for 4 days. The patient received treatment which included NSAIDs. The patient had not been COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

At approximately 8pm, 11 hours after injection, I began to experience a sore body and muscles.  Lastly, throughout the night I had sore muscles, joints, and minor chills.  These symptoms were moderate; however, I did not take any prescribed or over-the-counter medications to treat the symptoms as I did not want to interfere with the vaccine.  All symptoms subsided by mid-morning the next day.

Struggled to get up and down a set of stairs and had to go one at a time including holding the handrail (~43 year old male in very good shape, lifts heavy weights and runs 2-3 miles 3-4 times per week)  .  Managed to fall back asleep and woke up ~2.5 hours later with the same symptoms ,  plus higher fever (102 F) and additionally mild nausea and a very bad headache.    Took Tylenol and upon another 2-3 hour sleep had the fever more managed but dealt with the nausea, headache and aches/pains for the next 24 hours after that.   Symptoms resolved after about 36-48 hours , although I did not feel 100% back to normal until about 72-96 hours after this 2nd dose.

Any movement of my left arm resulted in strong stabbing pain in my shoulder.  After three days it improved and after one week it was completely gone.  The AE reminded me of calcific tendonitis flare up which I have in both shoulders.  I went to urgent care as I could not sleep due to pain and they told me to wait a few days and take OTC pain meds.

                                                I awoke at approximately 02:00 of the morning following the second dose, in a cold sweat and shivering so hard that I could not move (locked in a fetal position). This lasted about 30 minutes, after which I fell back asleep, exhausted. The next time that I woke up, I was walking into wall between the bedroom and the bathroom (I have no history of sleepwalking). For much of the remainder of the night I experienced multiple episodes of somnambulance, each time awakening when I ran into some object (bathroom counter, television, bookcase). The last time that I woke up, at approximately 07:00, I must have been standing and simply fell over; my head bouncing off the ground is what caused me to wake up. For the entirety of the day after vaccination (04/12/21) I felt as if I had the flu: chills (though no/very mild fever &lt; 99 F) accompanied by shivering, sometimes convulsive; sore muscles; hyperalgesia (light touch perceived as painful); lethargic; strong sense of malaise; loss of appetite. As stated, this lasted for the entire day, through the time that I went to sleep for the night (2300). The next day, 04/13/21 I felt completely back to normal with the exception that some muscles were slightly sore, possibly due to the exercise of an entire day spent shivering.

                                                The next day after the second shot, my right foot got acute pain. I had some  fatigue  on my left foot on the day I took vaccine and I had got it examined by the doctor, He did. To find any issue on my left foot and suggested it might be a regular sprain. He also examined throughly the right foot and it was perfectly fine in the day time of vaccinations. The pain on right foot joints got so acute that I could not move out of my bed. I waited for two days hoping that the vaccine effect will go in couple of days.but it became unbearable. I saw my pcp and the blood work showed erratic inflammatory markers and unusable high glucose very low platelets and I was given steroid for six days. The inflammation was coming down when I was on med and bed rest, last Saturday my right heel started showing a new and sharp throbbing pain. I went the ortho and they found that possibly my burssaties sack is inflameated. The pain is so unbearable that I am, prescribed some opioid based pain killers, the PCP and hematologists had a discussion , I was told that I may be developing auto immune disorder. I never had a history of ITP.  I am still hopi g it is a shock and body will calm down soon but I am on so much in pain and in a small place to get an immediate medical attention is so hard.

                                                Developed a lump a little bit bigger than golf ball size under his left arm in his armpit where he got shot; Uncomfortable and irritable to put his left arm down; Area painful to the touch under his left arm and armpit where he got shot; This is a spontaneous report from a Contactable consumer (reporting himself). This is the second of 2 reports. This 43-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0150), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 05Apr2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patients medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, genetic/ chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which included asthma. The patients family medical history was none. The patient had no AEs following prior vaccination. On 05Apr2021, the patient experienced pain at the injection site of left arm and on 06Apr2021, the patient had onset of uncomfortableness under his left arm and armpit, area painful to the touch under his left arm and armpit and it was uncomfortable and irritable to put his left arm down. When the patient woke up on 07Apr2021, that the patient noticed the patient had developed a lump a little bit bigger than golf ball size under his left arm in his armpit which is painful to the touch. The patient thought it may have started to develop that lump on 06Apr2021 but did not notice the lump until morning of 07Apr2021. The patient was wondering what he should do. The patient needs to know if this was serious and the triage nurse couldn&#39;t tell him and his doctor hasn&#39;t called him back. Event was unusual because the patient has never had a bump like that lump he has at this time-caller stated bump as a descriptor of lump. The agent caller spoke to earlier advised patient that if the patient was uncomfortable or in pain to go to doctors office so patient called primary care provider who said to go in to have it checked. Caller reported the agent tells you about the symptoms and agent said that he had seen swelling of lymph nodes was one of the symptoms in his clinical trials information for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine; and in those reports the swelling of lymph nodes usually goes away in about 10 days. Outcome of that event unable to be clarified as if recovered completely or with lasting effects-when queried caller reported that he did not notice any problems after that, did not have the pain at the injection site of left arm after that day or two.  No Follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                massive heart attack; knee pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 43-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Mar2021 12:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart attack in 2019, heart disorder (Heart),  Blood cholesterol abnormal (cholesterol), hurt his knee at work prior and torn meniscus. Concomitant medications included ongoing ticagrelor (BRILINTA) for the heart; ongoing atorvastatin for cholesterol and ongoing carvedilol (COREG) for the heart. The patient previously took clopidogrel (PLAVIX) for heart attack. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No adverse events following prior vaccinations. The patient called about the COVID 19 vaccine. He received his first COVID-19 vaccine on 12Mar2021 and suffered a massive heart attack on the same day. After the event, his cardiologist reviewed video from the heart catherization to open the blockage and the cardiologist indicated that the area that was obstructed with this heart attack had not been obstructed 2 months ago. The cardiologist believed that the COVID 19 vaccine is the culprit in causing the massive heart attack. The cardiologist believed the area of the blockage was too dramatic. The cardiologist encouraged the caller to report the event and the cardiologist will offer his expertise in this matter if needed. The patient also tried to report to his local health department but is waiting on a call back from them. He reported that he had a heart attack in 2019. He was taking Plavix but after this heart attack his cardiologist has changed some of his medications. He reported he believes his medications were changed at his follow up visit with the cardiologist on 23Mar2021. He reported that he had continuous blood work done while in the hospital. They were monitoring his troponin levels. He also had a chest X-Ray, EKG and after the heart attack he had an echocardiogram to monitor the extent of the damage caused by the heart attack. He clarified that he did go to the emergency department on 12Mar2021, the same day he received the Covid 19 vaccine, but for knee pain. He received a pain relief injection of fentanyl that day. He had hurt his knee at work prior. He had previously had an MRI of his knee that showed a torn meniscus. He does not believe his knee pain on 12Mar2021 is related to the Covid 19 vaccine as he had already had an MRI that showed a torn meniscus. He had gone to the emergency department for pain management of his knee. He thought he would be given a lower strength pain medication but received Fentanyl. While the patient was at the emergency room for his knee, he suffered a massive heart attack. The patient clarified that he went to the emergency department because of pre-existing knee pain and while at the emergency department caller suffered a massive heart attack. The patient was hospitalized for massive heart attack from 12Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The outcome of the event heart attack was recovering while the outcome of the event knee pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal association between BNT162B2 and the massive heart attack cannot be completely excluded. The knee pain was assessed as an intercurrent condition and is unrelated to BNT162B2.

                                                Little muscle twitches; felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines; Low grade fever; Muscle soreness; Muscle tiredness; Hands were a little shaky; Very diaphoretic; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other Nurse. This 44-year-old Nurse (Patient) reported that he received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown) at single dose for vaccination in Jan2021 around 9:45am. Relevant medical history included ongoing Mild shrimp allergy  and ongoing Hypertension. Relevant concomitant drugs included amlodipine at 10 mg once daily for Hypertension since Feb2020 and ongoing. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None.  Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was None. The patient was administered the COVID Vaccine around 9:45am; about 10 minutes later he had onset of little muscle twitches on the left side of his body that started in the calf then the glute, then the quadricep, then the bicep and then just started bouncing around everywhere on left side. Approximately a half an hour after that those little muscle twitches started on the right side of his body. Now the little muscle twitches are just everywhere; his hand, his heel, right now as he is speaking he is having the little muscle twitches in his heel; This event has been ongoing since onset; but changed today around 5:00am when he felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines which is probably impossible, but it feels like it is not just muscular now, like it is happening in his intestines which concerns him. The little muscle twitches do not hurt, he thinks that is probably why he has waited a week to call; but the fact that they are ongoing and changed today, worsened is unsettling. He reported since that first dose of COVID Vaccine was administered he has also had low grade fever; muscle soreness; muscle tiredness. He reported that a rapid response team was called immediately because of the initial reaction he had. Later that day his hands were a little shaky, he got very diaphoretic and the nurses on the unit of the hospital said he almost fell which he does not recall at all; in response to those events he was taken to the emergency department where they did a complete workup including labs: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), checked his heart and everything was fine; no notable results from any of those tests. The patient was not admitted to the hospital; under observation in emergency room only. Outcome of events Little muscle twitches, Low grade fever, Muscle soreness and Muscle soreness was not resolved, outcome of other events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

He is currently a highway patrol officer. While driving in his patrol car, at 1035, he felt tightness in the back of his neck and tightness to his airway- he described it feeling like someone hit him in the neck. He denied having any trouble breathing. Later, he noted his hand was twitching. 1045, he came back to lobby and made an RN aware who brought him to employee health. He declined to go to ED (I found out later).  BP was 153/115 HR 102  initially, no hx of high bp.  No noted hives or swelling to face or mouth/tongue or L deltoid region.  Pt. denied feeling any itching anywhere.  Pt. rested for about 15 minutes on exam table. Re-check of BP was 151/113 HR 84.  Pt. states he feels better and feel like that feeling of tightness in his neck is decreasing.   Made aware to follow up with PCP regarding BP and giving informational handout regarding blood pressure.  RN recommended he go to any ED if he has any trouble breathing, swelling of tongue, etc at any time after he leaves this hospital. Pt. verbalized understanding.

                                                On the 8th day after shot I started getting pain under left armpit. The pain became worse over the next several days resulting in what I&#39;d describe as an electrical shock/burning feeling whenever I moved my left arm the wrong way (seemingly pinching the lymph nodes). I&#39;m currently on day 5 of the pain and it&#39;s still present although it has lessened on the 5th day. On the 2nd day the pain started to move down from the armpit closer to the pectoral.

                                                With in a few hours of the shot I had pain up and down my right arm, up and down my right side and into my shoulder/ neck.  I went to home and had a slight fever with chills and could not sleep that night. I called off from work and stayed home. Over the weekend the pain in my neck. shoulder and arm continued.  I went to a chiropractor treatment that Tuesday 3/2/21. He made some adjustments and the shoulder / upper arm still did not feel better.  My right arm became more numb and weak on Thursday 3/4/2021 . My wife was sitting next me on our couch when I suddenly had a spasm in the upper arm.  The next morning I waking and had even more trouble lifting the arm or moving it. I attempted to suffer through it thinking it would get better.  Over that weekend conditions with the arm became even worse and was unable to lift it. I returned to chiropractor. He evaluated me and i described what had happened after the second covid shot.  He  recommend an MRI and I attempted to contact my PCP. With no answer from the PCP i went to the ED who said My PCP would need to order a MRI. I was then sent to physical  therapy and Orthopedics. They ordered an X ray and MRI. Both showed nothing.  Still seeing physical therapy with some improvement and movement. Have a EMG scheduled for April 22,2021

                                                This is sharing a concern / reporting a concern. This is not a complaint against anyone. This is not reporting side effect. The adverse effect date and time is a mandatory field. This is the reason I filled adverse date and time. I had my 2nd dose of vaccine on April 25, 2021 at campus at 1.20 PM. I just felt the syringe just touched the peripheral of my skin. I told the nurse that I do not feel I get the shot. Later, I do not feel any side effect any effect. I had no pain, or the site of injection was not swollen. I am worried I did not get the 0.3ml dose. During the first shot on April 4, 2021 at 1.43 PM, I felt pain on shoulders. I felt my tongue got thickened/ some tingling sensation on tongue and a little slur in speech. After 6 hours, I felt headache, a little chill, light head, nausea, more pain on shoulders and the next day, I felt light headedness and I felt tired for few days. I consider these as normal side effects and nothing unusual from what I read in internet and what I heard from others. So, I did not report it and it was a normal thing for me. Since I experienced this in first dose, I expected a more severe reaction than first dose. But I did not even feel pain at the site of injection nor any usual symptoms that usually appear. This made me to doubt I got required dose or the vaccine was correctly withdrawn from the vile. I do not know how to confirm that I got correct dosage. If I have not received the full dose, I am ready to take an additional shot and I would be flexible to take the shot at the available time near to my living place on any day.  Again, I am not complaining anything. Probably the nurse is very proficient in taking shot with no pain. I do not know why my body does not react to the second dose.

About a week later had trouble breathing, chest pain, felt like lungs were hurting in my back, weak, tired, couldn&#39;t catch my breath when i went upstairs and almost passed out. 2nd shot 5/04, felt pain at injection site (that was expected), that night started to get a bad headache and got worse and worse. Next morning, whole body aching, upper body, lower back, bad headache, Left underarm (lymph) swollen. 2nd day slight headache, neck ache, left underarm swollen. That night had rash on arms, chest, and stomach. 3rd day, nighttime rash arms, chest, stomach. Still red where band aid was over injection site. Over a week later still have redness shape of band aid, Seems I have sensitive skin since the 2nd covid shot. 10 days after 2nd shot I still have redness the shape of the Band Aid on my left arm. Got a red spot on my nose (looks like Rosacea). 4 weeks later, still have a red spot on my nose. I have itchiness between fingers left hand, on my face left side, neck, arms (left wrist, right arm in places) redness on chest, and rashes on back, left buttocks, and itchiness on legs. i noticed that it gets worse at night. As far as i know i did not get the Covid Virus, i did the rapid test and regular test and both were negative. But i was very sick with my stomach and had issues breathing in late 2019 and again early 2020, took medication (antibiotics) both times.   I had to write on this form over and over again kept getting frozen with error from the PDF. Even if I hit OK, it keeps popping up and does not let me finish, so I can imagine that lots of people gave up, like I may. Pfizer 4/13/2021 EW0162. After 5pm Pfizer 5/04/2021 EW0170. After 2pm

By 1600 I had extreme fatigue and severe mental fogginess.  This fogginess lasted approximately 24 hours.  Other reactions included chills, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, headache as expected.  I feel the mental effects could put patients in danger if healthcare practitioners are not aware of the possibility of this and receive the vaccine while on duty.  I did not experience this with the first dose.

                                                Received  second dose of  Pfizer COVID vaccination on January 9, 2021. At the time of the vaccination he experienced discomfort of  left deltoid (site of injection) as well as paresthesia at the injection site. He also experienced systemic symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias for 24 to 36 hours. Over the course of the next several days he experienced continued significant numbness and weakness in left upper extremity, specifically in left deltoid muscle. By Sunday 1/17/2021 the significant left deltoid weakness and numbness persisted, specifically not being able to lift his arm greater than 45 degrees using his deltoid. He contacted health on 1/17/2021. On 1/19/2021 he had a consultation with a physician. Based upon his clinical examination, and symptom complex, physician does not believe that this is a cervical spine issue but rather a local nerve injury related to the injection site. He was prescribed a steroid taper. Unclear whether this is temporary or permanent issue.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN). Thursday evening (14Jan2021), the patient had slight 1-2/10 substernal chest pain on/off. Friday evening around 23:30 (15Jan2021), the patient had chest pain substernal 7-8/10 that lasted for one hour. The burning sensation was worse with cold air. It resolved with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Monday early morning at 04:00 (18Jan2021), the patient experienced STEMI COVID vaccine induced wherein the patient woke up with 10/10 chest pain and shoulder pain which lasted for 30 to 40 minutes and resolved with paracetamol and ibuprofen. The patient also decided to check blood work Monday morning (18Jan2021) while in the hospital. Trop came back 16.28 ng/ml. This is the old trop not high sensitivity. Normal high is 0.30 ng/ml. The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2.

At about 29-30 hours, noticed mild numb feeling along right jawline from middle of mouth to right ear, and around the right ear. By morning (about 48 hours post vaccination), numb feeling appears gone on right jawline, but seems to have moved to left jawline (still mild). No trouble breathing or eating at all. Consulted primary care doctor out of concern over odd sensation, but not treatments at this time. Considering taking a benadryl tablet just to see if it has any effect.

Significant pain within 2 to 3 hours post injection. I could barely move the arm for about 5 days due to overwhelming pain. There were no visual symptoms from this injury. It began resolving after about 5 days and has mostly resolved but I still have some discomfort in the shoulder joint after more than 3 weeks.

Took Tylenol which eliminate the fever and all the aforementioned issues were resolved.  The second day noticed swollen painful lymph nodes on the right side of my collarbone (same side of the injection). The issue is still ongoing. Currently, I am taking Ibuprofen and using warm compression to alleviate pain.

                                                Around 09.50 at night, I started to feel chills and a feeling of cold for no apparent reason, and I had to go to bed because I could barely stand. Once in bed, I began to feel severe back pain, headache, and a progressive increase in fever to 103.5. I was taking Tylenol during the night and trying to hydrate myself, since I perceived that due to the fever, I was sweating frequently. The next day I also had a fever and a severe headache, but I was able to rest well, and today, Monday, I am already without apparent symptoms, beyond a feeling of moderate weakness.

Responding staff observed Subject had vomited on himself in the car. Subject reports he felt very euphoric, leaned his head back and was floating.  Thinks he may have passed out (does not know how long) and woke up with vomit all over him.  Thinks he may have had a seizure as his neck was stiff and had bite marks on his tongue.  As of 4/23/2021 Subject reports full recovery.  Has passed out before after having blood drawn x 2 in the past, but not shots.

I left work and went home to sleep.  I was unable to sleep due to the headache. I took my temperature with a digital thermometer around 4PM.  I was running a 102 fever.  I took three 200 mg Advil around 6pm.  My headache got better over the next hour.  My fever broke around 9pm that night.  I soaked through a shirt.  That afternoon and evening I experience joint pain.  It felt like needles being jabbed into my joints.  Or like lightening strikes in my joints.  I got a full nights sleep and the next day I felt 95% better.  This was my second shot.  I got it at the pharmacy.

The pain occasionally went away but always came back.  Around April 22 or 23 the pain moved down to the underneath side of my left  tricep just above the elbow, but still would occur at the original site on my back. By the 25th or 26th the pain had started occuring as well in my left pectoral muscle right at the breastbone.  Now the pain migrates around all 3 areas and can occupy one or all sites simultaneously.  The pain has subsided somewhat by   the time I saw my primary.  He prescribed icing the back 3 times a day and referred me to phys therapy.    Phys therapist gave me stretching exercises

                                                When I woke up the day after (Day #2) being given the vaccine I was extremely tired exhausted, I had intense chills and hot flashes. Never a fever. I felt nauseated. Completely lethargic. Muscle aches all over my body, was hard to move. I couldn&#39;t stay awake. My eyes hurt. I had intense migraines.  And no appetite. My right arm hurt, but not as bad as many others&#39; reported.  I took ibuprofen to help, it didn&#39;t. I drank lots of water and gatorade zero for the electrolytes. It didn&#39;t help either.  On day #3, this was when it got scary. The previous  symptoms carried over, minus the nausea and I was able to be mobile (less lethargic).  But something new started to happen. I took my dog out for a short walk, a slow pace, I am very athletic, and I had shortness of breath. I was winded from just walking slowly. Then the brain fog started to set in. This I hated the most. I wasn&#39;t able to comprehend things. I tried to assemble an item I bought from Amazon and it was extremely hard to follow simple instructions. I wasn&#39;t able to see clearly for some reason. And even comprehending emails that I was receiving was troublesome. I kept drinking water, and was able to eat a little. Had two more bottles of Gatorade Zero.  On day 3, most of all the symptoms subsided except that I still got winded from movement.  On day 4, I was fine.

                                                From hospital discharge summary:  &#34;45 y.o. right-hand-dominant male who presents with few hours of improving left arm heaviness/left hand cramping in the setting of getting his second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in his right arm 3 days ago and 3 weeks of mildly increased exercise/intermittent fasting. The patient reports getting his first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination on April 7, 2021. Reports some mild symptoms afterwards. Around that same time, the patient reports having a checkup with his primary care doctor that was notable for a cholesterol elevation to 200. This prompted him to try and lose weight including intermittent fasting and increase in exercise, especially for exercises and cardio.  The patient reports approximately 20 pound weight loss over the past 3 weeks. 3 days ago, the patient reports getting his second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in his right arm.  Reports fever (maximum 103 Fahrenheit) and mild headache the subsequent 2 days after the vaccine.  Last night, the patient went to sleep on his left side at around 8 PM.  He woke up at 4 AM with significant left arm heaviness and left hand cramping.  He tried to massage his hand with some slight improvement of the symptoms but otherwise the symptoms persisted.  Hence, this morning, he called his PCP, who told him to come into the ER for further evaluation. Here, the patient reports improving left arm heaviness/left hand cramping.  He also does report family history of heart attack and an uncle at a similar age and massive heart attack of his grandfather in their 60s. He denies fever, anorexia, unexpected weight change, headache, blurry vision, sinus pressure, cough, hemoptysis, orthopnea, PND, SOB, DOE, chest pain, pleurisy, changes in taste/smell, N/V/D, abdominal pain, flank pain, urinary sxs, genital sxs, black stools, incontinence, absence of flatus, calf pain, leg swelling, numbness/tingling, streaking redness/rash/skin changes, easy bruising. Also, deny history of HTN, DM, smoking, prior MI, prior PCI, prior CABG, prior TIA/CVA, or history of PAD. Further, denies recent trauma/fall, history of cancer, blood thinner use, recent drug use, recent travel, sick contacts, family history of connective tissue disease/congenital aortic anomaly, or family history of similar sxs. --- Hospital Course by Problem  # Troponinemia (Likely myopericarditis)  The patient has a family history notable for MI and CABG in relatives aged 50-70 on his mother&#39;s side. The patient notes that most of these family members were heavy smokers and drinkers, which he is not (never-smoker, rare EtOH, never illicit drugs). His symptoms are notable for L arm heaviness/cramping that began around 8pm on 4/30/21 at 9/10 severity and subsequently was 3-4/10 severity on presentation to ED and is 0-1/10 severity at time of admission to the floor; he has no associated numbness, weakness, coolness, or pallor. His symptoms are non-exertional. He denies CP, SOB, lightheadedness, nausea, jaw pain, abdominal pain, fatigue. He noes that he recently got the second COVID shot in the R arm, and had a post-vaccine course notable for Tmax 103 ~3d ago and 101 as recently as yesterday. His EKG was notable for ST-elevation in II/III/aVF and his troponins were elevated 305 -- &gt; 298 -- &gt; 328. Of note, his CRP was elevated at 69. The patients symptoms and findings could certainly be compatible with atypical ACS and, given the low risk of bleeding associated with heparin, he was treated conservatively upon admission with heparin infusion, metoprolol tartrate 6.25mg q6h, atorvastatin 80mg (he received ASA 325mg in the ED). However, given his recent covid vaccination and elevated CRP and reported fevers, this could also be compatible with myocarditis or other inflammatory etiology.  TTE on 5/3 demonstrated preserved EF 55% with no WMA. Given reassuring TTE, a cMRI was ordered to assess for myocarditis vs scar tissue from recent ischemic event. Cardiac MRI on 5/5 was notable for finding consistent with myopericarditis (see below). Aspirin and atorvastatin was stopped on discharge. Patient was discharged with metoprolol 25 mg daily.&#34;

Treatment: after 3 days of persistent symptoms, I talked to a doctor who recommended taking ibuprofen. I took ibuprofen for 3-4 days which mitigated the symptoms. Symptoms returned after a few days and persisted until now (17 days after vaccination)

On Monday the 11th they operated on my left knee because there was a lot of inflammation, that same day the second knee became inflamed, I was hospitalized from April 11 to 17 with a lot of pain in both legs.   On April 21 I continued with a lot of pain and swelling in both legs and even in the ankles there was swelling. A rheumatologist doctor, because of the laboratory tests she conducted, did come to the conclusion that it was reactive arthritis caused by the Pfizer vaccine.   Today June 1, 2021, I still have pain in both knees and ankles, especially the right one, both knees and the right ankle are a little swollen, until May 24 I walked with a walker and I did it with too much pain.

While eating I become nauseous. I stopped eating but still vomited (only once). At this time I started having shoulder pains and headache was worsting so I left work. About 2/3 hours after taking vaccine my entire upper body(shoulders up) was stiff! I took muscle relaxers and rested remainder of day. About 10/12 hrs after vaccine my headache was gone but still had moderate muscle pains.  Upon waking up up my body aches were only moderate so I went to work. 26 hrs after vaccine, I&#39;m still having mild/moderate body aches.

                                                Difficult to determine if this event was related to vaccination.  46 y.o. male with a pertinent interval and past history of HTN, sponge kidney, ckd, gerd and HLD.  Presents to ED with worsening redness and tenderness of his right upper mid thigh.  Patient states that he got the Pfizer vaccination yesterday second shot evening and then developed some subjective fevers sweats and chills.  Also had myalgias this all lasted approximately 2 hours but he was able to get to bed and fall asleep.  Woke up this morning feeling better but still with some chills but noticed some tenderness and redness in his right upper mid thigh.  This got progressively worse.  Continues to have chills but improving.    ED work-up including CBC unremarkable, CMP with mild hyponatremia and hypokalemia of 134 and 3.4 respectively.  ED drew blood cultures and then started vancomycin.  Vitals normal and stable in ED.  Admitted to hospital.  Provider notes on 2nd day of admission as follows.  Cellulitis and abscess of the right medial thigh likely secondary to a skin tag tear which introduced infection.  Patient currently is on broad-spectrum antibiotics in the form of doxycycline and vancomycin.  Unfortunately, the patient has been eating just ate lunch and also has been getting Lovenox.  He is not going to tolerate a bedside incision and drainage.  We will plan on proceeding to the operating room tomorrow for quick I&amp;D and cultures.  Procedures been explained.  The wound will need to be packed afterwards and ultimately healed in.  Patient seems understand plan and we will proceed accordingly

                                                The first dose of Pfizer vaccine was on 1/17/2021. I did not feel anything except a severe pain over my left arm only.  But the second dose of this vaccine (on 2/7/2021) was different. In addition to the severe pain on my left arm, I had (and still) a severe headache, pains all over my body and bones, high fever (102), dizziness, shaking, fatigue, cold at all times, and a little bit taste loss (as of right now, 24 hours after the vaccine). It looks like a hard flu symptoms exactly.

                                                Possible symptom 1: Within approximately a day or two of the shot, I developed a severe and persistent lower abdominal/groin pain.  The pain was very pin point in location and lasted for approximately 10 days before easing up.  Very small isolated pain severe enough to go to the DR, but I could not afford to on account of my wife having severe unknown abdominal pain and being in the ER and DR  multiple times herself (she got the same vaccine an hour before me?).  Possible symptom 2:  4-5 days after the shot I developed an isolated and severe pain in a preexisting nodule/mass (lymph node?) located on my mid right thigh, it has never had any sensation before.  The pain was persistently severe for approximately 7 days before easing up.

( face, leg, arm) I was made aware about 15 minutes post vaccine ( 1;30pm).  NO SOB, itching, rash.  BP 136/102. I I suggested getting medical attention. Nurse at facility continued to observe patient for total 30-40 minutes.  Patient said feeling better.  AT 2;15pm and 2;45 pm I checked on patient both times he was felling &#34;better&#34; than the last time I checked on him. Numbing was subsiding. Both times I urged him get medical attention.  He did call his PCP&gt; He would not go to ER, considered urgent care. ***patient told me before his 2nd dose that he had a numb arm post 1st dose, he did not report this to clinic staff  day of 1st clinic** I plan to follow up with patient in 24 hours.

                                                Got First Pfizer Covid vaccine on 06JAN2021. About 4 days after that I started noticing allergy symptoms and mild intermittent wheezing. Then on about the 5th day after, my lower back pain increased, causing significant sciatic pain worse than ever before. On 22JAN21 I ended up going to urgent care for increased breathing problems, and also had to have pain management appointment within days as sciatic pain was debilitating and also significantly interfered with my sleep.  After steroid injection (In spine)on FEB 3rd for sciatica/back pain, and steroids/inhaler treatment for the breathing stuff, I would say I was pretty good to go . I didn&#39;t think too much of these unusual events for me both in timing and severity. On 12FEB2021, I got my second pfizer covid dose. I 14FEB I started noticing allergy symptoms again, and slight shortness of breath, used inhaler I had from before to help as breathing in seemed to not give me full breaths. Then, on 15FEB2021, in the evening out of nowhere while walking, my lower back/sciatica pain came back in full force, as if my leg were a lighting rod like before. So it almost seems as if the covid vaccine triggered an inflammatory reaction in my body. I am not certain, but because the series of events seem the same and in timing after my first covid vaccine, I figured I would at least report it.

As the days have gone on it?s gotten a little worse. Left under arm pain, armpit area, left chest (pectoral) pain. Just lingering pain. Very sensitive to the touch. I also developed a rash on the left side of my spine between the shoulder blades. It  showed up this past weekend or the end of last week. It?s more of a painful rash than itchy. It?s very uncomfortable to lean against or lay on.  This is all 13 days after the second shot. I have just been taking ibuprofen for the pain.  Going to see my doctor today.

                                                Sudden and significant lower back pain in lubar region and localized without radiation to the legs.  Pain persisted 7/10 for first 12 hours from onset, gradually lowering to level of 2/10 over 48 hours and then 1/10 after 72 hours.   Onset of pain occurred without physical stress to the region (was quietly sitting in a chair).  Pain similar to when I herniated L5-S1 years ago (requiring hospital transport).   Pain was controlled to tolerable levels by immobilization (lie on floor with knees elevated, application of heat, and ibuprofen.   I did not associate this with the vaccine initially, but after consulting with my doctor, he recommended I report, as he stated there were some earlier reports about back pain with the similar Moderna vaccine, and there isn&#39;t a physical explanation otherwise as to why the sudden pain.

The next day my knee and calf was sizeably larger.  I went to the urgent care on March 19, 2021.  Then to the Emergency room on March 20, 2021.  They performed an ultrasound of my leg and found a blood clot.  It is in a superficial vein.  Followed up with a vein doctor and will go again in three months for another follow up.

                                                I already suffer from mild tinnitus.  About 14 hours after the 2nd vaccine dose my tinnitus became noticeably worse for a period of about 24 hours.  I also experienced the typical flu-cold like symptoms after the 2nd vaccine dose including muscle ache, stiff and achey joints, and general I&#39;ll feel for a period of 8 after that began 14 hours after the 2nd dose was administered.  I experienced fatigue for roughly 4 days after the 2nd dose.   I had no symptoms nor adverse reaction after the 1st dose.  My biggest concern was the tinnitus.  The cold and flu like symptoms I understand should be expected.

                                                About two hours after the shot, I began experiencing joint and mussel aches.  Between about 18-30 hours after the shot was the worst with flulike symptoms:  very achy (mostly joint, but muscular too), mild headache, fever at its highest was 99.3 F, and generally mild fatigue.  On the second morning and about 40 hours after the shot I still had these symptoms, except for the fever which was gone,  and they were much less and decreasing.  About 48 hours after the shot, I felt better and back to normal.  I took Tylenol after the shot for the two days which helped some and I had not adverse reactions to the Tylenol.

                                                a 46-year-old male with no known past medical history who initially presented complaining of headache and neck stiffness with onset the morning of 04/03/2021.  The patient states that his headache was initially gradual in onset and eventually decreased in severity on 4/5 however, on 04/06 after a day at the beach the patient developed a severe headache with rapid onset that he described as the worst headache in his life.  He did try to medicate himself at home with 600-800 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hr with minimal decrease in his headache pain.  As result he presented to  urgent care for initial evaluation who sent him to the emergency department for possible brain bleed.  On arrival to the emergency department the patient had a head CT which showed trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basilar cisterns likely due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm.  He was transferred to  for continued workup of the subarachnoid hemorrhage with CTA and possible IR intervention.  At time my evaluation patient was resting comfortably in the bed.  He continued to complain of severe headache and neck stiffness.  He additionally notes that light and loud sounds make his headache worse.  He denied any focal weakness, paresthesia&#39;s, numbness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or any other concerning neuro symptoms.  Patient was hypertensive during my evaluation despite being on a Cardene drip.  Patient&#39;s mother was at bedside and was able to assist with history.

The pain in the right wrist lasted for about 5 days. It has lessened through today but can still be achy. Shoulder pain persists. It is acute pain if I raise the shoulder while keeping elbow and hand parallel to the ground above shoulder height. I read today these symptoms could result from vaccination and the timing fits.

At work his cough and chest tightness worsened. Very tired, unable to eat with no appetite. Extreme fatigue Wednesday sleeping most of the day. Cough and chest tightness and feeling he cannot catch breath like being submerged in a pool. On 4.15.21 his feet became numb and tingling bilaterally.

He reports headache is not common, now 3-4/10 and feels very similar to Covid in November. Does have some mild neck stiffness associated. Chest tightness almost identical to Covid in November.

Reports that his cough and shortness of breath now seems to be improving.  Continues to have some mild chest tightness, intermittent cough.  Robitussin significantly helped.  Extensive workup including CT angiogram of the thorax reveals no evidence for pulmonary embolism or infiltrate.  COVID-19 PCR testing is negative x2, severe respiratory isolation has been discontinued.  Patient has a negative D-dimer, LDH, ferritin, CRP.   Cardiac troponin has been negative x2.  Patient does have some wheeze, after cough, suggesting some bronchospasm.  Will trial albuterol inhaler q.i.d..  Patient does report a history of what sounds like an environmental triggers asthma like event in the past, though reports that he has undergone evaluation for asthma and was told that he does not carry a diagnosis of asthma.  Patient is currently on room air.  I have reviewed the reported adverse reactions from the Pfizer vaccine and coughing shortness of breath are not listed.

By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain. I am scheduled for an MRI on April 23 and a visit with the Neurologist on May 10.

                                                Initial discomfort subsided within 24hr (Sx pain, fever and fatigue). Tx was ibuprofen 800 and hydration.   Lingering side effects,  1. I am an avid jogger/runner (5k and 10k and 13.1 miles). Since the vaccine was taken, I have not been able to run at the previous rate. Cannot complete a single mile without having to stop and massage legs muscles and stretch the joints.   The week prior to the second dose I was running 4 miles every other day and a long distance run weekly.  Also have not been able to complete my normal weight training routine. Arm, chest and back muscles shot in pain doing a previous dominate routine.  example, from doing a 100 repetitions with 25pounds dumber, I cannot do 20 repetitions with 15 pounds dumber without having to stop in pain. To be able to run, take pain killers and rub muscles with pain relieving creams before a run. 2. Fatigue, without changing diet or sleep habits, raising from the bed is hard. Feel weak and struggle to get out of bed. Not mental health issues, just physical weakness.

I did not feel as if I were having a heart attack, yet I experienced intense pain that was amplified when I would lie down - it was aggravated by even subtle movements.  Self guided research brought be to, &#34;Pericarditis,&#34; as a very plausible explanation as the symptoms mirrored online descriptions.  I did contact my primary care provider, however did not schedule an office visit as symptoms were manageable and improved across a period of several days.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (father) or other non health care professional.   A 46-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left on 24Mar2021 as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Parkinsons diagnosed 12 years ago and dystonia diagnosed 8 years ago from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing states the patient has had four deep brain stimulations and was in neurological care and takes a lot of medications. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to receiving Covid 19 vaccine. On 24Mar2021, the patient had the Pfizer Vaccine and a day and a half later could not feel his legs and has not been able to walk since; states the vaccine was the only different thing he had and everything else was routine and going on for years and his dystonia did not just jump and he can&#39;t say the reason this happened but it should be looked at. He can&#39;t say the Pfizer Vaccine was the reason for the reported events and he can&#39;t say it isn&#39;t the reason. On 26Mar2021, the caller stated that in the morning but could have been the night before as the patient was in bed and said he could not feel his legs and couldn&#39;t walk; states he could not stand up to this day on an unknown date and was in a wheelchair and everything was done in a wheelchair. Caller stated the patient had nothing new and no kinds of other medication or vaccines done other than what was prescribed by his doctor. Stated he was healthy other than what the disease has done to him. Stated for treatment everything was exactly the way it has always been and they adjust his deep brain stimulations once in a while and basically try to help out the dystonia and the Parkinsons seems to be taken care of but the dystonia was really the culprit. Stated that the patient had the Pfizer Vaccine and a day and a half later could not feel his legs and had not been able to walk since, the patient went to the health care professional and was going back again next week and the health care professional tried to adjust the batteries and increased his medication to see if that would help and the increased medication did nothing and nothing changed. The medication that did nothing was Carvidopa or Levodopa or whatever it was called and he went from taking 2 pills twice per day to taking three pills twice per day after the incident with the Pfizer Vaccine trying to help out and nothing changed. Caller states for some reason the Pfizer Vaccine just went in and did something to some part of his brain and must have gone after the weakest point and he was only guessing this as no doctor has answers and they don&#39;t know. The patient had been Carvidopa Levodopa for 12 years. Patient was afraid to take 2nd dose which was scheduled on 14Apr2021, and the patient did not take that. The event he could not stand up to this day and was in a wheelchair and everything was done in a wheelchair was assessed as serious (disability).The adverse events resulted in physician office visit. The vaccination facility type was reported as hospital. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

Narrative:  12/21 employee received vaccine at 0930 - later in the afternoon he noted tachycardia to about 100. He was watching the rate on his Apple watch. The highest rate was 130. His only other symptom was fatigue which was bad enough on 12/22 that he had to go home. He saw his PCP on 12/22 for the tachycardia who ordered labs which were all normal. He is a resident so he asked anesthesia to do an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia. On 12/23 his heart rate average went down to 100. Today (12-28) his resting heart rate is 70-80 which is his baseline. He has not had recurrence of the tachycardia since 12/23. He also reports he had soreness at the injection site and myalgias both of which have since resolved.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

                                                After first injection, I felt that my left rotary cuff tore. Then my right starting to feel the same. Went to Doctor, got Xray and initial assessment with only minor arthritis. But could not tell why the pain unless it was a tear. I describe this as sever joint pain at the rotarty cuff. Symptoms got better (not fully resolved) before next immunization. After 2nd shot, the next day my joint on the shoulder hurt but then my knee (which I have lived with out a ACL hurt a ton and swelled up). I also noticed muscle pain on the extremities and joint pain and minor swelling on finger joints. I do not have a history of arthritis and not prevalent in my family history.

The day after vaccination,  patient was complaining of fatigue with subjective fevers and rigors with associated headache and neck stiffness and on the day of presentation he complained of increased fatigue and general malaise for which he left work early and was ultimately found poorly responsive in his private vehicle with concern for possible seizure activity.  He was brought to ER by ambulance.  He reported numbness in hands and legs, rigidity, and an episode of urinary incontinence.  He was started on empiric antibiotics for possible CNS infection, lumbar puncture completed. Found to have acellular CSF and antibiotics were discontinued.  Patient remains in hospital at this time with course complicated by post-LP headache.

                                                I received my second dose of COVID19 vaccine in my left shoulder at approximately 3:50 PM.  I expected my shoulder to be sore as typical with previous vaccines I have received.  After dinner my should was very very sore and painful, but in a different way than I had experienced before.  The pain feels like it is in the joint rather than in the muscle.  The pain will subside if I keep my shoulder immobile and take Tylenol.  If I use my arm/shoulder the pain returns and worsens with use.  My range of motion is limited and becomes worse with use.   I will wait until the end of the weekend and seek medical treatment if this does not resolve.

It included intense pain during certain movements from standing, sitting, getting out of bed, etc.

                                                Got my first Pfizer shot on March 24 at 2 pm. The first day I felt way off like I was drunk or on some kind of drug that gets you high with bouts of dizziness and some major hypertension. My back and chest were very tight the whole time. The tension finally subsided around 11 pm that night but I was still uneasy. The 2nd day I felt ok in the morning and throughout the day until about 3 or 4 pm I started getting really nauseated and tired. I went to lay down to sleep and felt a little better when I woke an hour later. Day 3 I started feeling extremely tired and fatigued with some major chills. Basically slept most of that evening and throughout the night. Woke that next day and couldn&#39;t get that dizzy foggy feeling out of my head the whole day. Day 4-5 still bouts of dizziness, chills and fatigue with some nausea also I noticed I developed a wheezing dry cough which points towards respiratory distress. Day 6 still feeling yucky, tired, fatigued, some nausea and that dam cough. Today  03-31-21, still feeling weak and tired with some episodes of dizzy spells, nausea and respiratory distress cough.   Also forgot to mention on day 2 and 3 I had some major tingling on the right side of my head for most of the day. Felt like spiders crawling on my head and face. The last time I felt tingling like that I got shingles which also got me very sick and put me in the ER and ICU years ago. So there is also some post traumatic stress from that as well.  Made an appointment to see a Doctor on 03-30-21 to have my blood pressure checked and get an overall check up.  My blood pressure is elevated and stress levels are high with anxiety.  Dr prescribed me some anxiety medication. No other recommendations from the Doctor.

                                                feeling of swelling in tongue and lower lip. Scratchy feeling also in same areas. Started about 25 minutes after shot on drive home. Took allegra and it went away in 30-60 minutes. Tongue was sore the next day.  I also suffered a mild anxiety attack at the same time. Treatment for that was meditation and cessation of throat swelling symptoms.  Lastly, I also had a severe flare up of my fibromyalgia symptoms in my forearms starting 3 days after the injection. I don&#39;t know if this was a primary effect from the vaccine, or secondary from the additional nociceptive input from the joint and muscle pain I was experiencing in my forearms. I increased my lyrica to compensate. Two weeks out from the shot I&#39;m almost back to baseline.

                                                My husband&#39;s face swelled up. The right side of his face around his nose including his lips. It happened suddenly with no warning. He had been feeling ok but that morning experienced sudden onset of severe pain in his hip. He had taken ibuprofen for the pain a few hours before the swelling in his face happened. He has never had any reactions to ibuprofen. He has no known allergies. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before.  The swelling got worse overnight but during the following day the swelling started to go down. By that night it had gone down completely. Now he is fine but his lips look a little bruised, However, now we don&#39;t know if he should get the second vaccination which is scheduled on the 30th April. We did not contact a Dr.

                                                Within two weeks of the first Pfizer shot, I experienced significant joint pain in both shoulders, and more disconcertingly, significant pain and locking of the right knee. It continues today, though somewhat reduced in intensity. I assumed there was some significant structural issue with the knee, but an MRI indicates there is not. Furthermore, I have experienced pain on a periumbilical hernia, which I have had my entire life, but never experienced any pain from until approximately 2 weeks after the first vaccine dose. I can provide more detail if requested. To be clear, I don&#39;t know that any of this is causally connected to the COVID vaccine, but it is at least correlated, and these medical symptoms I have had are unprecedented and thus far unexplained.

                                                On Saturday, April 24, around noon, I heard a ringing in my right ear, then it clogged up. The clogged sensation changes depending on how much I move around, but it has not gone away. I can clear my eustachian tubes, so whatever it is seems to be further in the ear. I can still hear, it&#39;s just muffled in the right ear.  The only other adverse reaction I&#39;ve had was on Monday, April 19, where I had very sore hips/back around 8pm and around 11pm when I went to bed, I had chills as if I had a fever. Those symptoms were gone by the morning of Tuesday, April 20.

There was one small hive under the injection spot. It went away after after 10 minutes. I think my clothes irritated it? Still some slight discomfort in left arm in different areas in muscles. I did not exercise my left arm after the shot. Now when i exercise the arm the discomfort goes away. Its much better yesterday and today

The reporter (friend of the patient) called to file a report for his friend, who did not speak any English. The reporter wanted to make Pfizer aware of the adverse event that the patient experienced. The reporter stated that the hospital staff stated that they reported the patient&#39;s adverse event to Pfizer, the local health department and the CDC, but the patient&#39;s family and friends were not sure if the report was filed, thus the reporter was calling. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;6-7 hours after getting home from getting the vaccine on 16Mar2021, the patient started to feel fever, pain in his back, and pain in his neck that went up to his head. The hospital had given the patient Tylenol and the hospital staff informed the patient that if he felt a fever or pain after the COVID-19 vaccine, he should take the Tylenol. The hospital staff also informed the patient that if his symptoms got worse to call 911 and go to the emergency room. The patient took the Tylenol and his fever came down a bit and the patient went to sleep. On the next day, 17Mar2021, the patient&#39;s neck pain started going up more like a headache. On the morning of Thursday, 18Mar2021, the patient got weak. The patient could barely move his hand or neck or leg. After the weakness began, &#34;it was like 1-2-3&#34; and the patient was passed out.

I left the hospital, start driving, and suddenly felt that my right arm was heavy, numb, with a tingling sensation. I stopped the car and called the nurse and I was told that it will go away, and I can take a tylenol/motrin. It improved over the next hour and I felt it resolved a few days later but then it returned on 1/18 but not to the same extent, and I also felt intermittent tingling and numbing in my right foot. I also experienced intermittent episodes of fast heartbeats and missing heartbeats since the vaccine almost daily. I was fatigued and extremely thirsty for 3 days but that resolved completely.

                                                I received the first dose of Pfizer EK5730 at 18:07 on 12-30-2020.  For the first day my arm was a bit sore but nothing to bad.  The next few days 48-72 hours later I started to have many more  symptoms, some minor to sever including joint pain, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.  lesser included some nauseas.   The joint pain was so bad at one point i had to pull over while driving.  on 1-2-21.  as of writing this now 14 days out I still have some joint pain especially in my arms.  No other symptoms of note.   I would add that I tested positive for COVID -19 on 10-18-2020 and was not released from quarantine until 11-5-20  I did seek treatment during this time through by calling my Dr. did not require any hospitalization.

                                                Some background: I normally react badly to flu/respiratory vaccines in that I generally get sicker after the vaccine than I do when I get the virus.  So this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn&#39;t too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel &#34;down for the count.&#34;  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).  This morning is the week &#34;anniversary&#34; of the shot.

A 48-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, lot number EH9899, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 06Jan2021 at 09:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received vaccination in Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. Medical history included bladder cancer from an unknown date, cancer treatment with tumor vaccine therapy BCG (Bacillus Calmette Guerin) on 23Dec2020, bone spur in right thumb from an unknown date, COVID-19 from an unknown date and drug allergy to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (AUGMENTIN). The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. Concomitant medication included doxycycline. On 08Jan2021 (also reported 3 days after the vaccine) at 05:45 the patient experienced pain and swelling in his right knee/calf and ankle. Pain and swelling in the right knee, calf and ankle continued until 14Jan2021 when the patient went to the urgent care. He was sent to the emergency room with a suspected blood clot and ultrasound proved no clot was in the leg. On 15Jan2021 the patient went to a hematologist and had an additional ultrasound which found a bakers cyst behind his right knee. He continued to have pain and swelling in the right leg and left hand which had already arthritis and he suspected it was an immune response to the vaccine. Rest, ice, compression and elevation were suggested as therapeutic measures to treat the events. The reported events had not resolved yet at the time of the report.

                                                Approximately 18 hours after first shot in right arm, knee joint pain began in left knee which has now lasted 3 weeks. Pain requires walking with a limp. Second shot was in left arm and knee joint pain occurred in the right knee approximately 18 hours after.   I now find it difficult to walk normally on both knees. Pain at times is 7/10.  No previous knee issues.

                                                Shortly after the vaccination my left shoulder started to tighten up.  When I woke up the following day I could not lift my arm up at all.  Tried warm shower and OTC Meds but no change.  It was no better Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.  Went to hospital ER on Sunday 3/22 for x-ray etc. and diagnosed with calcification tendinitis.   Received 800mg Ibuprofen script.  Feeling slightly better today with more range of motion but still cannot lift arm much.  Still very painful at the core of the joint.

Few days after that I developed numbness and weakness on my left side and pins and needles in my Left index finger. I saw my primary care doctor twice that week. He started me on low dose Prednisone and gabapentin for the pain while sleeping. When the nerve pain/numbness did not subside, I asked for a neurology referral. Two doctors saw me for brachial plexus neuritis. I have had 2 ultrasound guided and one fluoro guided cortisone shots along the nerve. I have also been going to PT 2-3 x/week to regain my strength on the Left side &amp; calm nerve.

This 48-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EN6202) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 03Mar2021 at 13:00 (at the age of 48-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination the patient the patient had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications included fish oil, Men&#39;s Multivitamin and &#34;avmacol,&#34; all from unknown dates for unknown indications. The patent reported he started having pain in his neck and left shoulder; further described as like sore muscles, for which he was annoyed enough to take ibuprofen and use ice packs. On Sunday 07Mar (2021) the patient noticed there were clusters of small blisters all over his left shoulder and neck, overlaying a splotchy red rash; reporting they were mostly on the left shoulder, but started in the center of his chest and went all through to his back and stopped at his spine. The patient also reported the past very days he felt very unwell, enough to miss work. Aside from the rash/blisters, he had a headache, chills, and a fever that had come and gone, which measured 103.4 at it&#39;s worst. He reported taking dextromethorphan hydrobromide, guaifenesin, paracetamol, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (DAYQUIL) and dextromethorphan hydrobromide, doxylamine succinate, ephedrine sulfate, ethanol, paracetamol (NYQUIL) every six hours which he thought helped, and he reported using cold compresses for the rash, blisters. He stated he felt exhausted the whole time but had little sleep, which was helped by the dextromethorphan hydrobromide, doxylamine succinate, ephedrine sulfate, ethanol, paracetamol for a few hours. He reported today (as of 22Mar2021) was the first day in a few that he&#39;d felt alive enough to report. The blisters/rash were about the same, &#34;but the blisters.&#34; The events required a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The clinical outcomes of pain in my neck and left shoulder, sore muscles, cluster of small blisters, splotchy red rash, felt very unwell, headache, fever, chills, exhausted, and had little sleep were reported as recovering. It was also reported the patient was tested for COVID-19 post vaccination, and on 14Mar2021 had a negative nasal swab.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Strong shoulder pain started on Sat 4/17 in the early morning that woke me up. Went away by 10a after taking tylenol and having a coffee. Sun 4/18: pain again woke me up and was more severe. Had to get out of bed to move around as pain was pretty bad. Went to urgent care. Found nothing serious (not a heart attack or clots, etc). Referred me to go see my PCP if it did not resolve in a few days. Thu 4/22: went to PCP. Pain had subsided for the most part, but started having reduced range of motion when lifting arm straight forward...could not get past 90 degrees (straight out) without pain and a feeling of physical binding in the joint. Suspected bursitis. Prescribed a steroid pack and muscle relaxer.  Sat: 4/24: my son noticed my shoulder blade sticking out when attempting to reach for a glass of water while seated. Decided to make appt with an orthopedic. Fri 4/30: went to orthopedic. Took xray. Found no physical damage, trauma, etc. Noticed winged scapula as reason for lack of range of motion. Prescribed physical therapy. Fir 5/14: still same lack of range of motion and no pain. Went to first PT appt. They took range of motion measurements and agreed I was limited. Tested for other pain or signs of trauma and found none. Prescribed a PT regimen.   After my own research combined with symptoms, and no physical trauma as the source. My suspicion is Parsonage Turner Syndrome brought on by the vaccination.

A 48-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EP7533), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Mar2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 48-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EN6204) on 09Mar2021 (at the age of 48-years-old) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization and had no events following the first dose. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On 30Mar2021, the patient experienced body aches, muscle pain and joint pain in his hips, shoulders, knees, and back of neck. On Apr2021, the patient experienced a mild fever and could hardly walk. On an unspecified date, the patient&#39;s voice had been messed up. The course of events was follows: On 30Mar2021 at around 20:00-21:00, the patient had full body aches (further described as muscle pain and joint pain in his hips, shoulders, knees, and back of neck ) and then it got a little better for a couple of days. The patient woke up on 31Mar2021 and it was really bad. He tried to work through it. However, he finally went to the doctor and then the Emergency Room (ER) for the first time. He was put on meloxicam 15mg for 4 days and it didn&#39;t do anything, although it was reported he didn&#39;t take them all. On Apr2021, the first week after the second vaccine (also reported as a few days later, even up to 5 days), the patient had a mild fever, for one or two days it got up to 100.3 degrees F. The patient had not had respiratory problems or breathing problems. When the meloxicam didn&#39;t work, the patient went back to the ER. He received a steroid shot while there. He received 5 days of 60mg daily of prednisone. The patient felt fine when he was taking it, but when it wore off, he crashed real hard and was right back to where he could hardly move. After the prednisone wore off, he went back to the ER for the third time, on approximately 23Apr2021, because he could hardly walk. He was told to take ibuprofen and paracetamol (TYLENOL) until he could get into see his primary care. That was probably for about a week. The patient saw his new primary care and was so bad he had to use a wheelchair. The patient had regular blood panels completed with unknown results. The provider put him on the second round of prednisone, but he was told he couldn&#39;t keep taking it because it could really screw him up. He was prescribed prednisone 10 mg tablets to take 6 tablets for 3 days (for a total of 60mg), then 4 tablets for 3days, then 2 tablets for 3 days, then 1 tablet for 3 days and stop. He felt good at the beginning, but as the dosage went down, the medication wore off, his pain came back real bad. He was hurting really bad because he was tapering off the steroid, prednisone. He went in &#34;last Friday&#34; and they put him on duloxetine (CYMBALTA) 30mg by mouth once a day. He was also taking over-the-counter naproxen sodium (ALEVE) 220 mg about every 8 hours for pain. The patient was checked for &#34;rheumatoid stuff&#34; with unknown results. The patient was put on duloxetine because he was normally a very active person, but this had been debilitating, some days he cannot even get off the couch because of the pain and not being able to walk. He just started a new job and now he&#39;s not been able to work. For example, &#34;today&#34;, the patient can hardly lift his arms above his head because his shoulders hurt so bad. The patient reported that the muscle and joint pain persisted, but some days the pain got real bad. &#34;Yesterday&#34; he couldn&#39;t even get up hardly to go use the restroom, he had to use a cane. This morning, he has been able to get up better today. The pain is just always there since this all happened. He can&#39;t move very good, it hurt so bad. The patient also added that his voice had been messed up since all of this. The patient underwent the following lab tests on 27Mar2021 COVID-19 rapid test: negative, on 09Apr2021 COVID-19 test: negative, on 10Apr2021 COVID-19 rapid test: negative. The clinical outcome of mild fever, voice had been messed up and hardly walk was unknown, of body aches and muscle pain and joint pain in his hips, shoulders, knees, and back of neck was not resolved.  No follow-up attempts are needed; no further information expected.

Probably SIRVA is my guess (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration). Pain is getting worse not better and will be following up soon with primary doctor. Hurts to move left arm when utilizing muscle at injection site.

No other symptoms.  As of today the injection site pain persists as does the pain and numbness in my pinky and ring fingers, but I get the feeling that it is getting slightly worse.  The pain and slight numbness is present when I awake, but gets worse throughout the day.  Some evenings there is considerable discomfort.

It would randomly come and go from literally every area of my body and this was so pronounced it was hard to fall asleep that night.  Thur 1/21.  Leg pain gone but still week and tired.  Pins and needles sensation better but not gone.   Friday 1/22 same as 1/21 Saturday 1/21 same as 1/21.  Tried to do a little work around the house and was exhausted.   Pins and needle sensation remains the same.

                                                I am a physician who received the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in my right arm on 1-13-21. On 1-14-21 I developed deep aching right sided neck pain distinct from the injection site pain, and this progressed to right cervical radiculopathy, with 12-15 hours of radicular pain radiating from my right neck through my right hand.  The best way to describe this is it felt like a tooth ache from my neck to my hand.       That is not why I&#39;m writing.  I&#39;m writing  because around 2-9-2021 I developed a pruritic rash near my right wrist that I originally thought was contact dermatitis,  but I could not recall the initial contact.  The rash persisted, and 2-13-21 it spread, began to crust, and started burning, consistent with shingles in the C8 distribution. I&#39;m a 49 year old quacks-like-a-duck  doctor,  and wanted to share my story due to the possible connection between the Pfizer mRNA vaccine and herpes zoster.

Wednesday afternoon around 2pm, I went to my dentist thinking it was due to my Invisalign which I started on Jan 25, 2021.  The dentist told me it is most likely Bell&#39;s palsy so I decided to go to Emergency.

                                                Early Wednesday morning (2/24) around 5:00AM, I woke up to extreme pain in my left arm, primarily along the upper forearm, inside of my elbow, and lower bicep. There was no trauma or unusual behavior prior to onset of pain. It came on suddenly and worsened with extension of the arm. Symptoms worsened over the next few days, with pain intensifying and extending down into my hand and up into my armpit and shoulder. I tried ice, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, and Vicodin for pain relief, but nothing really helped other than the ice. On Saturday morning (2/27), I visited Urgent Care and was diagnosed as brachial plexis neuritis, aka Parsonage-Turner Syndrome by Dr and prescribed Prednisone and rest. On Sunday evening (2/28), I went to the ER seeking pain relief and second opinion. On Monday (3/1) morning, I was seen by ED doctors, and then three different neurologists. After doing an ultrasound which ruled out vein/artery thrombosis, the neuro team diagnosed Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. They&#39;ve prescribed Gabapentin, Acetaminophen, and Ibuprofen for pain relief,  a follow-up neuro consult, an MRI for next Friday, and an EMG in a few weeks. Last night while sitting and reading, the same pain began in my right arm, similarly to how it presented in my left arm last week. The right arm pain is less than the left arm pain, but at this point seven days later, I am experiencing neuropathic pain in both arms.

A 49-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: E219899), intramuscular, administered in Deltoid Left on 21Dec2020 11:00 as Single dose for covid-19 immunisation at Workplace clinic. Medical history included colitis ulcerative from 15Jul1996 to an unknown date (mild symptoms). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced low grade fever, myalgia and joint pain. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable. The causality assessment from reporting person and reporting was unrelated. The outcome of events was recovered.

                                                1 hour after receiving the vaccine,  my face and neck on the side of the shot started to burn like a nerve issue and then went numb. My arm where I received the shot went cold and burned. A friend came over and took the temperature of my hand because it was cold and it was 15 degrees colder than my other hand. I took 1 Benadryl of 25mg and laid down for a few hours. At around 4 hours after the vaccine my neck went stiff as well as my upper back. I am reporting this because I don&#39;t believe the neck and face going numb is a normal thing and it was concerning and had it continued I would have went to the ER. I am not sure if the Benadryl helped but maybe.

He had headache, nausea, disoriented.  Then he went to bed, woke up at 9:00 AM and had a seizure, which he has had in the past but it had been over a year.  He rested after the seizure and knew what to do and it took 2-3 days to recover from that due to the weakness in the legs, disoriented.   He has gotten stronger and is pretty much back to his normal self.  He has not had any additional seizures since then.   He had his FU physical today and she is aware of the seizure and told them to report the incident.

For dose 1, I did not feel the pain until one week after I took the shot. It took fours days to disappear. For dose 2, I felt stronger pain at the same place (left armpit) at the night when I took dose 2 shot (4/14/2021). Now 4/16/2021, I am feeling better and predict that it would be gone in days.

Within about 2hours the numbness also affected my left leg along the outside of the leg to the pinky toe and all around the lower thigh. Symptoms still present 8 hours after injection at time of writing this description.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing. Within 2 months, he has lost 47 lbs and eats all the time and is still losing weight. He was about 200 something and was kind of built and now is skin and bones. He lost 6 (lbs) pounds within a week and is eating like crazy. Sensory nerves are all gone. If hit with a baseball bat and he would not feel it. It came on slowly almost that he did not know it was happening. That is why they want to send him to Privacy for a research center and he does not want to go. He never had this happen before. ER or physician&#39;s office required: 1st date was on Thursday, 11Feb2021, when he went to Privacy. He was having chest pain and hurting all over. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was released. The patient stated he wanted to change the information he had provided since he was not in his right mind since he had taken the wrong medication dose than the doctor had given him. He stated the medication dosage he wanted to change was for Amiripyin. He stated he wanted to say he told the representative the symptoms he had experienced was enhanced which they were yesterday because he was trying to fight everything and stay awake. COVID 19 vaccine: he stated the doctor did not want him to take the second dose of the vaccine. He stated one of the symptoms he had experienced after the vaccine that he wanted to change the outcome for is the neuropathy. He stated he is back to where he used to be and yesterday it was bad he could hardly walk or talk. He stated also the other symptoms he wanted to change the outcome for is the autoimmune. The patient has not recovered from neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, disoriented, can&#39;t walk or lift anything, chest pain, and sensory nerves all gone; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Woke up at 12;30AM with a 101 degree fever and intense pain in lower back/upper buttocks. Fever/pain persisted and worsened throughout the night. Aches spread to other areas of my body but still centralized to back/buttocks. Headache introduced in the AM. Fever bounced all day between 102 and 104.2 degrees all day until about 8:30PM on Sunday. Tried ibuprofen to manage pain and temperature but had minimal effect. General tingly and buzzy feel after 8:30PM and into Monday. Headeache reappeared on Monday evening with cold sweats. Strange calf ache in right leg Monday night into Tuesday AM that consistently woke me up. Tried massage, stretching, to no avail. Tuesday AM most everything dissipated with just a bit of fogginess throughout Tuesday (though less than Monday).

Progressed to affect both arms within several hours. Numbness, cold, burning sensations, tingling. Also feeling of weakness and slight loss of motor control. Symptoms continued to occur intermittently for around 6 days affecting the arms and legs along the outer part of the limbs. At one point I had almost no feeling in my lower legs. I still have numbness/loss of feeling in the outside portion of my left thigh which became worse after the second does of the vaccine, but has persisted since my first does of the same vaccine. I also experienced severe stiffness and strong pain in my spine. The pain affected different parts of my spine but the worst of it was concentrated in my lower back, which lasted several days.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

Unable to eat anything I started to vomit stomach acid. It is now 2 days later and I still have a degree of nausea and am unable to work today. I got the 2nd vaccine on Monday.  It is Wednesday and I still have no appetite for food and have lost about 7 lbs since the weekend. I feel that I am starting to round the corner to recovery though.

                                                Date these symptoms started was 1/27/2021:  About 12 hours after injection, developed fatigue and slight nausea as expected.  Oral temperature 98.0.  Commuted to work without issue. ~ 1400: As day progressed, nausea subsided, but fatigue grew more profound and developed pain in the right subscapular area with exertional shortness of breath walking any length of time. (Injection of initial and second doses were both in right deltoid). 1540 - 1800: Fatigue increased, developed a burning/tearing pain with every yawn and deep breath from the top of my trachea into both left and right mainstem bronchi and radiated to right arm.  It literally felt like someone was trying to tear out my bronchial tree with each breath. 1800: Arrived home and medicated self-medicated with Motrin 400mg. 1800 -2030: rested at home with still some breathing pain, no shortness of breath, but incredibly tired. 2045: Went to bed and slept for the next 12.5 hours without any issued during the night. 0800: Woke up nearly all symptoms were gone, only some minor residual fatigue.  No breathing pain, no nausea, no subscapular pain. I did not seek medical attention for symptoms, nor did I contact my provider. I experienced fatigue and a headache with the first dose, but no other symptoms.  I never experienced fever or chills

                                                About twenty minutes after the injection, I was walking to the transit and my legs felt a little bit numb (but not tingly) I thought maybe it was nerves. About 25 minutes after the injection, I was concerned (possibly too anxious) and I decided to return to the site. I crossed the bridge and sat down at the bridge gate. The personnel there called an EMT, and about 15 minutes later the EMT came to talk to me and take my blood pressure and pulse Oxygen. Blood pressure was 137 - 87. Pulse Ox was 100%. By that time I had calmed down the sensation in my legs had eased. Approximately 2 hours after the injection I began to feel soreness in my joints (and this did not pre-occupy me, since I knew that feeling the beginning of aches and pains a couple hours after injection is normal). It is now 6 hours and 32 minutes after the injection, and I am feeling ok. It was quite probably anxiety on my end. The folks in city were very nice to me at the pedestrian bridge gate. I have noted talking the EMT below as health professional visit, I also plan to go see Dr. prior to the 2nd shot.

                                                Initial confusion upon waking at 7AM. Uncomfortable but unable to determine why. Tried to re-arrange pillows but could not get arms to complete the process even though fully mobile. A minor amount of weakness in arms/legs and tingling across the lower face, particularly on the right side. Once up, had an inability to form words even though thoughts were coherent. Minor difficulty swallowing water. Speech slurred badly enough to be incomprehensible to my wife. By 7:30 we arrived at the hospital where symptoms were improving.

I also noticed that I started feeling really sluggish with some muscle pains.   Approximately 11:30 PM, I attempted to go to sleep and noticed that I started having a minor respiratory distress where I could hear myself wheezing.  The wheezing only lasted about one hour.   All the symptoms disappeared after 36 hours without any treatments or medications.  At this point, I&#39;m not sure If I should get my second vaccine shot.

I went to bed and work up at 2A with body aches, stiffness, and joint throughout my body. The next day I continued experiencing the cramp in my leg and body aches, stiffness, and joint pain throughout my body, and general fatigue. The symptoms were mostly gone after my second night&#39;s sleep. I am still feeling lingering (mild) soreness and fatigue today, 4/2/2021.

After 2 days, pain in neck subsided as pain in left shoulder blade and left shoulder increased and after a week left index finger and thumb became numb. Pain remains in left shoulder, however pain in shoulder blade after 2 weeks moves from left should blade to neck and sometimes both. Loss of sleep due to pain and on a scale of 1-10 pain is an 8-9 constantly. Went to a Chiropractor on Monday, March 29, 2021 for an adjustment and assessment, nerve test reveled nerves in that area not firing properly. Followed with a massage with no avail or reduction in pain or numbness. Have an appointment with DO my doctor on Thursday, April 8, 2021 or if she can get me in sooner.

Morning fever of 101F. Headache, Dizzy, Fatigue, Muscle Pain (esp in legs, asif he had &#34;run a marathon&#34;). He spent most of the day &#34;resting&#34;.  Evening on day two, we noticed a large bump under his vaccinated arm. Radius about 5cm - larger than what I know swollen lymph nodes to look like - almost looks like a bicep between his armpit and nipple. Tender to touch. Morning of day three (48 hours after vaccine) bump under his arm remains and all other symptoms seem milder.

                                                Approximately 36 hrs after the injection I started feeling severe nerve and muscle pain to the left deltoid (the injection site). there are no other signs or symptoms noted. It is a debilitating pain especially after even the most mundane of tasks. OTC pain relief is ineffective.

                                                A few hours after the second dose of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine, I had a very sore arm. About 36 hours after the shot, I discovered two very large hives/welts on my back that were very itchy and stung. I took my daily Allegra during the day and then a Benadryl at night. I also applied hydrocortisone cream on both. Today is April 14 and they are both feeling much better with treatment and seem to be going away.

Severe dizziness to the point I could not walk, headache and joints pains started around 10am while at work. I left work at 1:30pm  When I got home around 2:00pm, I felt tremendous amount of fatigue.  I slept from 2pm until 5:00pm.  I went back to bed at 6:30pm.  During the night I had cold chills and sweated all night until my sheets were drenched.  I slept until 9:30am.  I felt much better after taking a shower. I would not have the second dose!!

                                                Had soreness and tenderness at injection within one hour of vaccination. Approximately 13-15 hours after Vaccination, woke from sleep with fever and chills. Fever was 100 as measured using oral digital thermometer. Experienced mild body muscle aches and stiffness, especially in the upper back, shoulders and neck.  Had mild to moderate fatigue and persistent headache at base of skull. Also experienced muscle twitching within 2 hours of vaccination through the lower limbs and torso, with more activity concentrated in the legs and feet. Was not painful, but strange. Some of this muscle fluttering and twitching preceded muscle cramping in the feet. Frequency was almost continuous with short, 60 second pauses between twitches. The moved and we?re not in the same exact location. We?re especially active when when lying flat, relaxed in bed. All symptoms aside from the twitching subsided fully by the following Morning (April 15th 2021). Took body temp that morning and had returned to 98.7 f.  Muscle twitches have continued  five days beyond vaccination, although they have grown milder and less frequent.

A 50-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 15Jan2021 at 12:00 as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Historical vaccine of BNT162B2 was given as first dose on 28Dec2020. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included varicella zoster vaccine rge (SHINGRIX) taken for an unspecified indication from 14Dec2020 to an unspecified stop date, Escitalopram (ESCITALOPRAM), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), MVI, ergocalciferol (VIT D) and calcium (CALCIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. On 16Jan2021 at 11:00 patient experienced fatigue, chills, body ache and low-grade fever. Symptoms were significant enough that he remained in bed and missed planned activities. Second set of symptoms began on 06Feb2021. Patient says the second set of symptoms is most likely unrelated to his Pfizer COVID vaccine. However, sharing this might be helpful in the event other recipients describe similar symptoms and timing. Symptoms began at 03:00 AM as mild dyspepsia, bloating and loose stools and mild bilateral LBP. Pepcid relieved my dyspepsia which slowly resolved over 24 hours. The bloating has resolved but I have persistent loose stools and mild LBP. During this time patient have had no fever or symptoms of URI. All the symptoms have been mild and have not prevented him from participating in planned activities. Again, doubtful this is related to vaccine but curious to know if anyone else has reported this. The outcome of the events was not recovered with diarrhea and backpain whereas recovered for the other events.

A 50-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Jan2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER4176) as 1st dose, single,   then on the right arm on 09Feb2021 (lot number: EL9267), 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccines were received in four weeks.

My heart rate at that time was 85-90/min and BP was 140/90. Pulse OX was normal. The dizziness improved gradually and lasted for approximately 4 hours. I did not take any medication. Next day, on 1/5/2021 I still felt a little dizzy and I had muscular pain on my L arm. The symptoms completely disappeared on 1/6/2021.

A 51-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: 28Dec2020 (as reported)), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at single dose, as a preventive measure for Covid. Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure). Concomitant medication included amlodipine besilate and amlodipine besilate (NORVASC 5 mg) both for blood pressure. The patient reported, &#34;I received my first dose of Covid19 vaccine on Monday (28Dec2020) and it is now Friday and I am still sick and I am wondering how long these symptoms typically take to get better from because it seems like it is day 5 now so&#34;.

I was not nauseas or anything like that. I still have fever today. I did not get symptoms till like 2 days later and then my fever was up to 101.7. It is down to 99 now but I still have the fever.&#34; The patient mentioned, &#34;I kind of like started feeling poorly on the 29th (29Dec2020) late at night but on the 30th (30Dec2020) I had fever and everything.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: is always good on an unspecified date, body temperature: 101.7 on 30Dec2020, body temperature: 99 on 01Jan2021 (reported as &#34;I did not get symptoms till like 2 days later and then my fever was up to 101.7.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

The sensation moved to shoulder, traps, and face after about 30-45 minutes.; numbness/tingling mostly right side (arm, shoulder, face); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 51 -year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, 0.3 mL, lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 at 05:30 PM, (at the age of 51 years-old)  as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, hypertension and asthma. The patient was allergic to gadolinium MRI contrast, morphine (plus standard environmental allergies). Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included allergy shots weekly, vitamin C, vitamin D3 and zinc quercetin. The patient did not receive  any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 05Jan2021 at 06:15 PM, (also reported as 30 min after injection), the patient&#39;s right arm and hand suddenly felt tingly and a bit numb (like it was &#34;asleep&#34;).

                                                Day 8, I woke with a headache, chills, vomited 4 times, muscle aches, and heart palpitations all day until around 8 pm. I couldn&#39;t keep food down until then. From Day 8 until yesterday (Day 11), I have been having intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, which is my only serious concern.  I have had a declining number of heart palpitations today, Day 12, but felt I should report these heart palpitations in case this is a sign of a serious complication. Should I avoid receiving the second dose?

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

Both IM through my left arm. Directly for about less 48H post vaccination I had muscle pain that were self-resolved.  On Jan 18, 2021, I started having funny sensation (like having a foreign body) over my left eye medial /innercantus area. The next 2 days I started to have pain over my left external ear canal, then it progressed into pain over my left lower jaw, left vertex of my head, inner side of left eye. My SS progressed on 1/30/21 at around 3:30 PM to numbness over my left sided tongue and left sided lip. Then on 1/31/21 at around 5 AM, I started having left facial paralysis. I have left BELL&#39;s PALSY which was confirmed. following a negative non-contrast brain MRI to rule out stroke and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR test. I start taking Prednisone 60 mg daily and Acyclovir 1 g TID on Jan 31, 2021. To this date I still have left facial paralysis but not worsening.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization.

On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

Headache lasted until I went to bed that night took Tylenol throughout the day with occasional mild help but not much. Took my temperature it was 98.8 I usually run around 96/97  It got up to 98.8 later that morning. As the day progressed my muscles ached and I had very little  energy.  I napped a little but otherwise was just planted on the couch.   The headache was the most annoying and steady.   All symptoms were gone when I woke the next morning.  My temp today is 97.7 and that?s a little higher than normal and my head still feels a little warm when  someone else feels it and I feel still a tad warmer than normal.   Otherwise I feel pretty good.

                                                At 36 hours after the injection, I began to develop a skin rash, initially only on the underside of my right forearm. Over the following hours, the rash covered the entire underside of both forearms, from elbow to wrist; rash also extended from armpits down the side of the ribcage on both sides. Some rash also appeared across the ribcage and on the back, at the base of the spine down to the sacrailiac. Currently nearing 72 hours after injection.  I also experienced considerable chills and muscle/joint aches, which has improved, but which has not yet disappeared.

                                                Shortly after receiving the injection my arm went ice cold all the way to my fingers and warmed up again quickly. On the way home (about an hour later) I noticed numbness and tingling in my hand and that has continued since (11 days as of this report). My upper arm muscle was sore later that evening and by the next day the pain in my upper arm was extreme. I couldn&#39;t move my arm without extreme pain. I took some tylenol late in the day and that did help cut down on some of the pain. I also put an ice pack on my upper arm but it didn&#39;t help. The pain wasn&#39;t as bad the next (3rd) day but it&#39;s still significant enough for me to restrict activity with it. There is also a burning sensation off and on as well as itching deep in my arm. My upper arm has also felt like there is a tight band around it (since day 2) although the muscles themselves don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s any tightness or knots. I took ibuprofen on day 10 and it helped a little but not a whole lot. At this point I also have what feels like swelling or tenderness under my arm near the armpit area. The pain, burning and itching in my upper arm continues as well as the numbness, tingling and pins all up and down my arm to my hand and fingers.

                                                About 4 hours after the shot (on Monday), I developed pain in my left leg--particularly the left buttock and left shin. The pain rapidly became worse. Walking became quite difficult.  Tuesday, I received a steroid injection from my doctor. The pain got slightly better over the next few days. Saturday, I started a course of oral steroids: 20mg prednisone, three times per day. Symptoms have been improving significantly, although as of today (Tuesday) there is still some pain.  The pain was specific to my leg. I didn&#39;t get any other aches.

                                                The day after my vaccination I felt like I had mild to moderate flu symptoms, achy, stuffy with headache. The day after that the flu like symptoms abated, but then were replaced with muscular and joint soreness, especially in the lower legs.  It felt like my calf muscles were going to charlie horse at any moment.  Also, I experienced random muscle twitches throughout my body, but mostly in the calf region.  This muscular twitching has continued for two weeks now, though it has abated to some degree in terms of frequency and intensity.  The muscle twitching is the reason that I&#39;m writing this report.  I expected that I might have flu like symptoms, but not twitching muscles all day and night.

Within another 24 hours the pain shifted another 2 inches towards my left armpit. Pain can be slight to intense at times requiring me to sit down.  Within 24 hours I developed a painful bump in the trapezoid about halfway between neck and shoulder.  The bump has gone down now (day 10) but the pain continues. It?s relatively constant throughout the day but gets severe enough towards the evening to stop or minimize the use of my left arm. It seems to be activity related. The more I need to do that day, the worse it is in the evening. Pain in left arm has been as expected but continues at day 10. It is slowly subsiding and is minimal compared to the other two pain locations.

This pain has been ongoing and unrelenting since March 1st.  Pain is worst at night from approximately 2 hours after bedtime and all through night.  Lying down appears to make it worse.  During night, I&#39;m unable to turn my head left or right without intense pain.  I have never suffered pain like this in the past nor have I had any injuries.

Patient is a 51-year-old male with a PMHx significant for hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis and morbid obesity who initially presented to the ED for evaluation of chest pain, cough and shortness of breath.   On presentation, vitals were mostly unremarkable other than some mild tachycardia and tachypnea.  Patient was able to maintain adequate oxygenation on room air but was placed on supplemental oxygen for comfort.  Blood work was mostly unremarkable.  ABG was not particularly concerning.  Troponin was negative x3.  Patient underwent chest CTA which showed basilar atelectasis bilaterally and scattered groundglass opacities and scattered borderline size hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes consistent with patient&#39;s known sarcoidosis.   Patient was treated with supportive care and monitored overnight.  He was able to maintain sufficient oxygen levels.  On the time my evaluation, patient continues to complain of bilateral rib pain worse with deep breaths consistent with costochondritis.  I discussed with the patient that he will need to continue to take NSAIDs on a scheduled basis to help with his discomfort.  Additionally I offered to prescribe cough medicine. I discussed possibly discharging the patient on steroids however he states that he makes a point to avoid taking steroids due to his history of hemochromatosis.  At this point, patient no longer requires care in the hospital and can be discharged home.  Patient is agreeable with the plan and all questions have been answered appropriately.

They tried to give me muscle relaxants and pain meds. But It did not cure anything. I have had a low-grade temperature(usually exactly 99.5 but sometimes higher ) for 38 days and does not go away. I felt inflammation and at the hospital, they did a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and it showed 144 mg/L. I entered the hospital from 5/21/2021 till 5/25/2021. They ran many tests but found no infections. They did possibly find some preexisting condition that I might have had all along.  The only problem I have is I was completely healthy per se (even with the preexisting condition that I didn?t know about) right before the vaccine I was able to exercise, able to lift weights, good energy level, and eating properly. I feel like the vaccine is still somehow working in my body even that is not supposed to be the case. I feel like my body is still in a state of hyper inflammation and it killing me.

Medical history included sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, seasonal allergy and covid-19 in May2020. The patient reported he had symptoms of the covid-19 virus in May2020. He had a positive covid-19 virus test and did quarantine. The patient reported he&#39;s never been allergic to any kind of medication. Concomitant medications included atenolol 50-25 mg at one tablet a day. The patient didn&#39;t know the name of the other medication combined with the atenolol. The patient reported one was for the heart and one was for the blood. He also took medication for seasonal allergies but declined to provide the name. The patient previously received a flu vaccine (NDC/Lot/Expiry: unknown) on 2020 that made him feel bad with a head cold. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EP7534), at the age of 51 years old, in right arm at single dose on 02Apr2021 16:30 for covid-19 immunization. The patient started having some problems maybe a week after that. He started feeling like the nerves in his right arm were jumping. Like his right arm was agitated. His finger on his right hand were swollen. The patient did get his vaccine in the right arm. He thought his arm was going to bother him after he got the vaccine. The nerves in his right wrist are bothering him. Like he felt the nerves moving up and down and his arms, like he had no control of his arm. His right hand blew up with inflammation. His right hand looked like it was going to explode. His right hand won&#39;t relax. On 01May2021 was when he noticed his arm acting funny. He would say that the swelling had gone down from taking the antibiotics but his right arm was still very uncomfortable and he couldn&#39;t bend the fingers on his right hand and he couldn&#39;t make a fist with his right hand. His right wrist felt like needle and pins. The patient went to the emergency room at a hospital two nights in a row on 04May2021 and 05May2021. The first time he had x-rays done. The second time he had x-rays and a sonogram of his right arm to check for blood clots and he had some blood work done. All of that came back negative. The emergency room doctor asked him what arm did receive BNT162B2 in, he told the doctor his right arm, the doctor told him he&#39;s having an allergic reaction to BNT162B2. The emergency room doctor prescribed him an antibiotic to take. He&#39;d already finished the antibiotic and didn&#39;t recall the name, the bottle had been thrown away. The patient followed up with his primary care doctor on 13May2021 and was given a prescription for a muscle relaxer and motrin 600 mg to help bring the swelling and pain down in his hand. In the emergency department he had a right arm and right wrist x-ray. The doctor was trying to figure out why his right hand looked like a balloon. The only conclusion the emergency room doctor came up with was that he was having a reaction to BNT162B2. The outcome of events nerve in wrist bothering, felt nerve moving, feeling nerves jumping, right arm agitated, no control of arm, right hand won&#39;t relax and couldn&#39;t bend fingers was not recovered. The outcome of events hand blew up with inflammation, fingers on right hand swollen, right hand explode and pain in hand was recovering. The outcome of events wrist felt like needles and pins and allergic reaction to vaccine was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 51-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 04May2021 (at age of 51 years old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included flu, has gotten the flu before but has never gone on this long.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Clinical course as reported: He is a practicing physician who has been providing vaccinations to patients all of his life.  He ended up with severe right deltoid pain. It is usually not a problem, he has dealt with this with other shots.  By the second or third day, it was very tender and swollen and had axillary lymphadenopathy on the same side he re-ceived the vaccination. It persisted the next day until day 5 or 6. He then started to get worried.  He went to the hospital. They did a CT scan which noted there was notable lymphadenopathy. They thought it was a reaction to the Covid vaccination.  2 days later, he went home and he kept taking Motrin and Tylenol on board. Lymphadenopathy was evident in the left axilla, inguinal nodes, and is still there now. On day 7, he went into full blown flu syndrome, had a headache, body aches and flu like chills, the whole thing. Is still a little bit rhinitic and is very congested, and is draining like a faucet. It has all been happening since he got vaccinated. He was told he was either exposed to covid or it is from the vaccination. He went to urgent care yesterday (20May2021) and they did a Covid test which was negative.  He hates to point fingers but this fatigue has been overwhelming and is never ending.  He called withheld where he got the vaccination. He said the pharmacist has been hearing this from a lot of patients.  He reported for 7 days straight the clinical events as they were happening. Nobody has contacted him, they said some-one would be contacting him the next day and he has not heard from anyone.  This laid him up for 5 days. The last 4 days, he had severe pain in the left foot, and the right hand. It was out of the blue like someone whacked him with a hammer. He couldn&#39;t even walk, it was completely painful.  He hasn&#39;t worked out since he got the damn shot. In 15 days, he has not gone to the gym.  They did an X-ray which didn&#39;t say anything. He was in immense pain. They gave him prescription for Prednisone 50mg and he hasn&#39;t been able to get to the pharmacy to get it yet but will head over shortly.  Has been taking Motrin and Tylenol around the clock. Has been taking antihistamines because his nose has been running like a faucet non stop and he has a sore throat. Sore throat has gotten better in the last 5 days. The pain was really bad. The sore throat has subsided. The  nasal drain-age and his eyes are watery are still there. Has been fatigued and his body aches and he is exhausted.  The second vaccination is due 25May2021 and he is absolutely not getting the second one.  When having other viral syndromes, he has never felt this sick. Has gotten the flu before but has never gone on this long.  He is just feeling like crap. Can barely even get out of bed every morning. It is unbelievable. He hasn&#39;t had any true positive exposure. Has not been exposed to other family members with Covid/ coronavirus.  Have practices strict isolation in their home. They have 5 kids and they did not go near anyone or go to any public places.  For this to happen, it has to be because of the vaccine. Nothing else could have caused this. No one else around him has been sick. Is not sure if they are getting a lot of reports.  When going on line to the Pfizer vaccine reporting, it took him a while to get a number to contact Pfizer directly. He called (Withheld) and they gave him 2 wrong numbers. It took 4 people to get the number to report this to Pfizer. He thinks there is a lot of under reporting.  If he has a deductible, he would like Pfizer to take care of the cost for his ER visit. On 21May2021,  reported that Beginning 05/04 when received vaccine, experienced Very large lymph nodes and Flu syndrome. Outcome for events sore throat was recovered on May2021, for other events was unknown.    The lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The only way to describe it is the nerve pain you feel when you hit your funny bone. That was the sensation I was feeling throughout the body.   There was also intense bone pain and lower back pain.  These were also the same symptoms I had when I had a mild case of covid 3/2020 and didn?t know I had it.   In June 2020 I tested positive for antibodies.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine.  I received the 1st dose at approximately 11am on April 2nd.  I went to sleep and woke at approximately 4am on April 3rd  with a sharp pain/ache in my side.  I went to the bathroom and began to experience chills and started sweating.  I was sitting on the toilet and passed out.  My wife heard me hot the ground and I came to.  I had had another experience passing out while on the toilet a month earlier, for which I went to the ER and was discharged.  Test run on the early occasion were all negative.  I did not seek any medical attention immediately following this event but will be following up with my primary physician.

                                                I developed cipro toxicity in 2017 due to a dose of cipro combined with steroids. Symptoms include neuropathy, tendon damage, vision and hearing issues, muscle aches and burning sensations throughout the body. These symptoms flare. I have been pain free for four months before getting the Pfizer vaccine. All of my symptoms came back 2 hours after the shot.

It&#39;s important to inform because the media and the doctors are not reporting how bad and lasting the side effects are and it is important to be transparent to patients what to expect, otherwise trust is eroded and people stop getting vaccinated.

A 52-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 52-years-old), administered in Arm Right on 12Apr2021 13:45 (Lot Number: ER8731; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included psoriatic arthritis (diagnosed with this for a few years, like maybe 6 or 7 years), cholesterol. Concomitant medications included pravastatin and ezetimibe, both taken for cholesterol and from unspecified start dates and ongoing. The patient experienced shingles on 17Apr2021, muscles tight on an unspecified date. He received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine on 12Apr2021. Then on 17Apr2021, he developed a red spot on his shoulder (on left shoulder, It was a red spot with bubbles filled with fluid), cold chills, and a &#34;funny feeling&#34; or pain on his left hand or arm (&#34;Then, he went and got worse. Then, he had chills and no fever but he had cold chills&#34;). He added that Saturday morning, he was not feeling right. Then added that it was like Friday he had a cold or something. He adds that he does not get high fevers so he thought he had like allergies but it was not so, and he had cold spells. He did not have a fever. The skin on his left hand felt funny when he was touching it, it was almost painful. Like, when someone touches their hand it feels okay but this almost felt painful to touch. It was his left hand. It was his left shoulder almost close to his neck where the red spot was. Saturday, he saw the spot and felt symptoms. He thought maybe he touched something, or something bit him. Sunday, the symptoms did not go away. He started feeling worse, feeling sick but not a fever. He said it persisted until Sunday. By Monday morning, because his wife is a daycare director, he told her he got sicker and not to go because he felt sick and he did not know if he had COVID or he did not know what he had. They went to the clinic to make sure it was not COVID. He got tested for COVID, but also told them he discovered the red spot and he had symptoms. They tested him for COVID and it was negative. The doctor looked at the red spot and saw his symptoms and said that patient has shingles. He then was diagnosed with shingles and was given medication for it. The doctor told him all the signs were matching with shingles. Patient asked the doctor if this is related to the vaccine and the doctor said honestly she does not know if it is related. He was given a drug for 7 days, Valacyclovir. Treatment: Valacyclovir 1000 MG 3 times a day for 7 days. He started this medication on Monday. He has also taken Advil. The doctor told him to take Advil. He usually takes it in the morning, and then if he starts to need it because shingles can make people feel cold and flulike symptoms from the shingles. It goes away but it is not consistent. He takes it whenever he does not feel well. The headache is because of the spot the infection is, close to his neck. It gets muscles tight and that creates pressure. It is hard for him to lay down and sleep because of the shingles. He wanted to know if this is a normal reaction with the vaccine and if he should still receive the 2nd dose, and what he should do next. Currently, symptoms &#34;Skin on left hand felt funny&#34; comes and goes, &#34;cold chills&#34; got better but did not go away completely. All the symptoms, like usually he will take Advil, and they will go away. He adds that the chills will go away and get better as the days progress with medications. He did not have a cough. The headaches were intense. The red spot on shoulder, the dot is on his left side of his chest and it moves around, now it is bigger on his chest. The shingles expanded and went to his chest, too. Shingles are painful and no fun. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test: negative on 19Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I had COVID in early December 2020.  I waited a few months to get the vaccine.  I was fine the day of the vaccine 16 MAR.  I took the next day off 17 MAR  because I was running a fever and and had body aches.  I did not have any alcohol on St Patty&#39;s day.  I pretty much slept the whole day.  I went back to work on 18 MAR and was feeling better with only a mild ever.  The night of 18 MAR I began to run a fever and had body aches.  The body aches worsened during the night I could not sleep.  The body aches became centralized in my upper back and shoulders,  My neck was hurting too.  I began to feel chest pains.  The chest pains increased in intensity.  I researched the symptom&#39;s which suggested I was having a heart attack.  I took some aspirin to try to alleviate the pain.   The pain continued and more severe so I drove myself to hospital. The staff  gave me an EKG and took blood samples for testing.  The EKG was normal.  The blood test came back with elevated levels of Troponin.  The Dr.  advised that the Troponin level indicated that I probably had a heart attack. the first hospital did not have a cardiac unit so I was transferred to  downtown location.  The staff there ran more test.  The EKG was again normal and the Troponin elevated so a Coronary angiography was conducted with catheter and dye.  The angiography was also normal with no sign of a heart attack the doctor said I probably had a reaction to the vaccine.  He suggested that I still get the second vaccine.  I did  get the second vaccine. After the second vaccine I only had fever and body aches, I pre0-gamed with aprin  and plenty of rest for the second vaccine.

A 52-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0173 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 08May2021 at 02:38 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included Bug bite (happened 5 days prior to 30Apr2021 and regimen of an antibiotic). He was completely done with the rotation for a least 8 days before he got the vaccine. It might have something to do with this. concomitant medication included dicloxacillin (started it on 30Apr2021 and it was for 5 days. He did not know what it did was). The patient reported that on 08May2021, day one, he experienced, tiredness and injection site pain. On day 2, until now side effects which had not gone away. It hadn&#39;t gotten worse, but it was not any better. The patient felt like congestion, but his nose was bone dry, like crusty dry. It hurts a little bit because it was so dry and he had arm soreness, nothing out of the ordinary. The arm soreness was just normal injection stuff. At first it was a little tender on the injection spot. It went away after about a day. On 10May2021, the patient felt like there were little, tiny baby hands pinching his internal organs randomly throughout his abdomen. It was not a sharp pain, more like a little squeeze all through his abdomen. It felt like his whole throat was swollen. It was not visually swollen, it more felt like a football in his neck. Stretching it was helping. His toes have been locking up like a pre-clamping. He had numbness from his ankles to his feet for 8 days, and now he has numbness from his knees to his feet. It was not completely numb, but it was not normal. The feeling of baby hands pinching his internal organs started the second day after the vaccine and has stayed consistent. The patient&#39;s eyes swollen, and his vision was diminished. Day 2 through today, it felt like his eyes were swollen, his vision was seriously diminished, he had a golf ball sized welt on his arm not at the injection site but 2 inches from it, and he was really dizzy and really lightheaded and almost fainted at the corner store. The feeling like his eyes were swollen started on day 3 after the vaccine. The crease of his eye be-low the eyebrow and on top of the socket got red and puffy and looked like sunburnt skin does. It was at the point that now it feels swollen all the time almost like he had pink eye and his vision has been diminished about 30%. He had a test done yesterday and his vision was 20/25. Some-times he could not even read a text and had to stare at his phone for 10 minutes to make out words. He did not have these issues before. The feeling of his eyes being swollen was a little better in the mornings and about 1300 it gets worse when he gets lightheaded to where was when it started. His vision became diminished about day 3 after the vaccine. It was a little better in the morning, but in the afternoon, it goes to exactly the same as when it started. He noticed the golf ball sized welt on his arm about 3 days ago. The doctor seemed to think a drop of the injection might had travelled from the injection site and his body was creating a defense to it. It was scary to take a shower and then see that. It didn&#39;t hurt. It was not painful, but it was a weird foreign entity. The cramping in his toes started probably day 3 and was consistent. The numbness started on day 2 after the vaccine, and up until 3 days ago it was just his ankles and feet. 3 days ago, it got to the point where it was from his knees to his feet. It has gotten worse since it was now travelling up his legs. On his injection arm- 2 inches away from the injection site appeared a size of a gigantic golf ball - when asked with his doctor he said that he thinks that a drop of the vaccine travelled and his body building a reaction to it and it was very abnormal. The patient also had numbness from his ankle to his feet worsened and from his knees to his feet- almost feels like it was cold and tingly. The patient also had dizziness and lightheaded about day 2 after the vaccine and it was the same. It came in waves but was consistent throughout the day. He would be fine then had a wave of dizziness. He has been laying down so much because he was so tired, ringing ears, felt like his glands were swollen, pressure in his neck to his injection site, and back pains. The patient stated that his doctor was only form urgent care. The patient Felt like whole throat was swollen, toes locking up, really lightheaded, mind has been foggy, and arm soreness. The patient had bizarre side effects from the Covid Vaccine for 11 days now. He thought it was the smart thing to report them to Pfizer. He didn&#39;t like to give personal information. He declined to give his mailing address or his email address. He hated when asked for race, but he guessed it might be important. He did not have a mailing address, phone number, or email address handy for his physician. He went to Urgent Care yesterday to have it checked and they did an EKG and said he had to be sent by ambulance to the ER. The doctor did bloodwork, and she said everything looked alright and to rest a few more days and keep hydrated. The patient underwent the lab work and procedures which included chest X-ray with unspecified result. He thinks it was on 18May2021. His mind has been foggy with all of that. It was yesterday or the day before. He could not be sure. He has been sleeping so much and was in a complete daze. The fogginess he had the whole time as his other symptoms, and it was the same. He has been eating well and hydrating and taking a multivitamin and Gatorade, all the things&#39; people say to do. He asked if Pfizer has heard of this before. He was panicked it might be chronic, and he worries about the safety of the second shot for him. He was sure many people haven&#39;t reacted, but these are freaky side effects. He asked for advice and if Pfizer had heard of this before or if he was some weird anomaly. On his way to get the vaccine he asked 2 people at the city health line if they had taken it and they both said no. He asked 3 other patients and they said they took the Pfizer. One woman said she will take it when they make her. The guy who gave him the shot lied and said he wasn&#39;t eligible. It might have been his way of not having to discuss it. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior vaccination. The patient was tested for Covid post vaccination with Nasal Swab on 18May2021. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Device Date: 23May2021,Additional information has been requested.

A 53-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), solution for injection, lot number: EK5730, intramuscular in the left shoulder on 23Dec2020 12:00 at a single dose for covid-19 prophylaxis. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient&#39;s historical vaccine included Shingrix and experienced weak, tired and achy that lasted for 24 hours, he received this 6 months ago (2020). The patient experienced achy joints and fatigue, both on 24Dec2020 at 10:00 with outcome of recovering. The patient called about the Covid-19 vaccine and reported that he received it last Wednesday on 23Dec2020. He said that since then he has had achy joints and fatigue that started on Thursday 24Dec2020 that has been going on through today. He received the vaccine at the hospital where he works at. His symptoms are persisting, but stated that he does feel a little bit better today. He said that it does not seem to be getting worse. He read achy joints and tiredness were some of the reactions to be expected with the medication, and now he was thinking it was a little more long term than what it should be.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

That was not well controlled with Tylenol - still stayed about 100.5. Also had some gastro-intestinal distress - diarrhea. Lasted for about 36 hours. And then my fever went down and I felt pretty good but still experiencing some low grade fatigue and a little congestion which is lingering from first dose. Lingering effects may be from COVID

                                                1st symptom: Within 30 seconds, ache in arm from elbow to wrist.  Got worse over next few minutes, fairly uncomfortable for about 45 minutes before subsiding slightly (tried to keep moving arm as recommended).  Pain returned when I drove to work and while at my desk.  Lasted for approx 4 more hours.  Injection at 11:15am, pain mostly ended around 9:30pm (except when reaching or extending arm, pain in shoulder now mostly). 2nd symptom: Mild nausea starting about 5 min after injection, while in waiting room.  Passed when laying down at home before work, approx 45 min later..  Started again while driving to work and lasted from about 4pm to 8pm.  Subsided about 10pm.   3rd symptom - feel very fatigued.at typing of this report at 10pm - started about 5pm. So far nothing else - no headache or chills for example.  No pain at all at the actual injection site - now the pain is mostly above it - from the shoulder joint to near the injection site (maybe a couple inches above.) as well as the forearm, all around.   To make coping easier in case the symptoms (arm ache, fatigue, etc) are worse as commonly described from the 2nd dose I put in and was approved for PTO from work for scheduled 2nd date on  March 30th.   Will allow me to rest (avoid being effected at work with the fatigue and an even more achy arm as expected side effects of 2nd dose)

I told the Dr there , they released me after 20 min , as there was no serious pain . After couple of days with Sore Arm pain , my left ribs area became a little sore and starting to have what felt like nerve jolts from left side of my Neck down my left arm.   The Neck pain and nerve feeling got steadily worse over the next 3-4 days , on the 5th or 6th day the pain was so bad I could not move out of bed in the morning for over 2.5 hours.   With a sudden move there was lightening bolt type pain shooting down left arm and right leg.  Pain subsided over the next 3-4 days.  I would say now it&#39;s 90% .

                                                Received the first shot of Pfizer Covid Vaccine at 10:00 AM on 3/21/21.  Aside from some drowsiness I felt fine the entire day.  Then that night I woke up at 2:30 AM with severe pain in my right knee.  I was unable to bend the knee or walk for the next 36 hours.  After that the pain transitioned to the back of my calf muscle for the next few days.  The pain then went back to my knee for a day and then returned to the back of my calf muscle.  On 3/30/21 I saw my primary care physician who then sent me to get an ultrasound which determined that the pain in my knee and calf were caused by blood clots (DVT).  I was then prescribed Eliquis 5 mg blood thinners.

When he came home he complained of numbness and loss of strength in his left arm and as the next hour progressed he began experiencing numbness in his left hip and decreasing strength in his left hand. I called a medical professional who told me to take him to call an ambulance or take him to the nearest hospital. We arrived at the hospital at 2:30pm and symptoms persisted. By the time we arrived his blood pressure had jumped to 185/114  (This morning before the shot he had self monitored his BP @ 128/80)

                                                In the late afternoon of April 23rd I started to experience the effects of Bell&#39;s Palsy.  Droopiness in my lip, eyelid not closing, difficulty in drinking and eating.  We went to our local minor emergency center around 4pm and confirmed it was an episode of Bell&#39;s Palsy.  The Dr prescribed Prednisone and Valtrex.  I took the first dose around 6pm. All week long I&#39;d been experiencing a mild headache and had seen the dr the day before.  The diagnosis was muscle tension with arthritis in the neck and was assigned to physical therapy.

A 53-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left (left shoulder) on 30Mar2021 09:00 (Lot Number: ER8733) at age of 53 years old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. Family medical history relevant to events: caller states he don&#39;t think so, his father had high blood pressure and diabetes. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen taken for tooth disorder at 600 mg every 8-12 hours, taking it probably a week before receiving the vaccine. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No events following prior vaccinations. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient experienced slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at on 30Mar2021, chills on 02Apr2021, fever on 02Apr2021, sweating on 02Apr2021, continued muscle pain on 03Apr2021, skin, hair was hurting, couldn&#39;t touch skin on 03Apr2021, muscular pain down to pelvis and knees aching on 03Apr2021, diarrhea on 03Apr2021, fatigue in 2021, headache in 2021, weakness and dizziness in 2021, sinus drainage in 2021, feels dehydrated in 2021.  The patient was calling to report some long term, severe side effects. He received the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He didn&#39;t have anything then muscle pain for the first two and a half days, no reaction until on Friday 02Apr2021 he had extreme chills, fever, sweating, then that continued on to be muscle pain, his skin and hair were hurting, couldn&#39;t touch skin through Sunday 04Apr2021. It dissipated into muscular and inner-skeletal pain. He had muscular pain down to pelvis and knees and things would start aching.  Now it was kind of letting up. It was the 4th day now and no one he knows who had gotten it had such a long term reaction to this. Clarified that he had slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at and that dissipated on Thursday 01Apr2021 and he had no pain anymore and no other side effects. On Friday 02Apr2021 afternoon when it went haywire and thought he may have to go to the hospital on Sunday 04Apr2021. He had diarrhea and almost had everything on the list except redness at the site injection. He also did not have swollen lymph nodes. He didn&#39;t think he needed to go to the hospital, he normally didn&#39;t get sick and hadn&#39;t been ill for years and this was why he wanted to report it because it seemed that it was pulling for along time. He had been sleeping and drinking a lot of liquids. Headache, joint pain, and diarrhea continued all the way through Monday 05Apr2021 and started to dissipate Monday evening. He had no nausea and vomiting. The muscular pain down to pelvis started Saturday 03Apr2021. His knee would ache and then that would stop and then his other knee would ache then stop. It was like it would transfer around lower part of body, and that dissipated late Monday 05Apr2021 night into Tuesday (06Apr2021). Now he had fatigue was tired and had sinus drainage. He felt dehydrated and couldn&#39;t seem to drink enough liquids to get the feeling of dry mouth out.  The diarrhea, fatigue and the sinus drainage was still continuing and the other symptoms seem to have dissipated. He still felt so fatigued and didn&#39;t feel the other symptoms are there. He hoped they didn&#39;t return. It had stayed the same for the diarrhea, fatigue and sinus drainage and he was still tired. Later added he did have weakness and dizziness, but assumed it was fever and chills. Caller states he did have weakness and dizziness and Saturday 03Apr2021 and Sunday 04Apr2021 were the worst two for all of the symptoms at the same time. It had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021 evening. Outcome of weakness and dizziness: Caller initially confirmed it had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021. However, he later stated he was still experiencing slightness there. He still feels some weakness, and feels about 60% right now.  He thought it would be a good idea to get vaccinated because he had family members that had contracted covid-19 and be less weary of the virus. He was hesitant now to get the second shot. He was taking ibuprofen because he had issues with a tooth. He was taking Benadryl for the sinus and hadn&#39;t taken it in 36 hours and hadn&#39;t taking anything else. He was already taking Ibuprofen for the tooth issue, but was also using it to relieve some of the symptoms and if it was indeed that he may have contracted something after that. He hadn&#39;t been to the doctor but for checks ups in years and years.  Time of Onset (24-hour clock): Caller stated it started about 1-2 pm in the afternoon on Friday 02Apr2021 and came on very quickly. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of diarrhea, fatigue, sinus drainage was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 53-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 21Mar2021 at 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing Factor V Leiden heterozygous, allergies to mushrooms from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and a torn meniscus in his right knee and he had surgery 3 to 4 years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Cephalexin and Percocet and experienced allergies. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested post vaccination. On 22Mar2021 at night around 2:30AM, the patient woke up and started walking to the bathroom and he passed out from pain. He had pain in his right knee. He thought he had torn his knee again. He had surgery 3 or 4 years ago for a torn meniscus in his right knee and he thought he had torn his meniscus again. He passed out, his wife found him and he went back to bed. In the morning, his knee was still very very sore, he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all. He took an Advil between 6:30AM and 8:00AM. He hadn&#39;t taken any medications prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. His knee was swollen but the pain was manageable. He couldn&#39;t walk, he was on crutches for about 24 hours then the swelling started coming down and he put a brace on his knee. He could then walk without the crutches but it was still painful. The next day he had pain in the back of his knee. He thought the pain was caused because he had put the brace on and had been using the crutches. Like he had made his knee more stiff from not using it. He was limping around and the pain was bearable. At that point, the pain was maybe a 4 on a scale of 1-10 where his pain had been a 9 on a scale of 1-10. He took another Advil and he realized the pain in the back of his knee wasn&#39;t going away. He went to see his family doctor and his doctor was able to get him in that same day for an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed 2 blood clots behind his right knee. The patient had blood clots in right leg below knee. The week of the report, he got an appointment with a hematologist. The hematologist reviewed his case and the doctor isn&#39;t 100% sure the blood clots were from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine but the doctor isn&#39;t ruling it out either because it happened within 24 hours of receiving his first COVID-19 dose. He hadn&#39;t done anything strenuous before getting the COVID-19 vaccine, nothing that he thinks would have caused the blood clots. He would like to add, what he thinks is relevant, is that he is positive for Factor V. He reports he has one copy and Factor V only impacts about 3% of the population. The hematologist thought that he might be prone to developing blood clots. The hematologist reports that he has had patients who have had the COVID-19 virus who have developed blood clots. Maybe it&#39;s possible that the COVID-19 antibodies were trying to build up his immune system to COVID-19 and it created something similar to having the COVID-19 virus. If he is predisposed to blood clots then the COVID-19 vaccine may have precipitated the blood clots. His second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for Sunday, 11Apr2021. He had talked to both his family doctor and his hematologist and they both thought he should be ok in getting the second COVID-19 vaccine. He was prescribed blood thinners. If the second COVID-19 vaccine caused more blood clots the blood thinners would help him. He was asking if there is any additional information or guidance on receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine after his reaction. The pharmacist told him that the COVID-19 vaccine trials were all done in the left arm. He received his vaccine in his right arm and his right knee was affected. If he gets the second COVID-19 vaccine he&#39;s getting it in his left arm. He was prescribed Eliquis 5mg take one tablet twice daily. The outcome of the event blood clots in right leg below knee was recovering while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 53-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 53-year-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Apr2021 11:15 (Lot Number: EW0153) at 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. The patient received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included famotidine (PEPCID AC).  The patient previously took flu shot in Oct2020, prilosec [omeprazole magnesium] for seasonal allergy and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced unexpected bruising near injection site. Bruise was the size of the bandaid, approximately 1&#34; x 2&#34;. Bruising had persisted for more than a week now. The patient had never experienced bruising like this with other vaccines. He would like to rule out possible thrombosis reaction before second shot. He did not have bruising at any other locations other than the injection site.  Bruise was purple and red splotches and has now progressed to mostly yellow. He believed the discoloration was a reaction to the vaccine and not the result of the needle. The shot itself was painful but patient felt minimal pain/stiffness following the shot. The event start date was on 20Apr2021. No treatment was received. The outcome was unknown.

During this time I had quite sever pain behind my knees whenever I bent my leg very far.  At one moment the pain was really sharp when I bent down to pick something up.  This pain behind my knees decreased a few days later,  but never totally went away.  It is now 6 or 7 weeks later.....and I still have soreness behind my legs, especially when stretching them.  Somewhat concerned it is not going away and may get worse.

But after getting the 2nd shot, about a week ago from yesterday, he experienced double vision for about 15 minutes. When he got the 1st shot, the Monday after, he experienced the worst headache of his life worse than any hang over. He never had neurological issues and it terrified him because could not shake it right away, it lasted for about 15 minutes then it was gone. He asked if that is something that is a side effect that could be concern and should he be worried about it. Caller reports double vision for 15 minutes. He got the shot at about 10 am. This happened after the 2nd shot. He got the second shot on 28Apr2021. Caller confirms his first shot was on 07Apr2021. Double Vision: It lasted for about 15 minutes and he waited until it came back.

Was treated with hydration and Toradol.  However, spiked a fever (possibly due to vaccine) and was pan-cultured (blood x2 and urine) and given IV antibiotics for possible UTI/pyelo.  Blood and urine cultures were negative and was discharged after overnight observation.  Did not have a history of kidney stones before this event.

                                                38 hours after vaccination I woke in the middle of the night with extreme abdominal pain, dizziness, and severe diarrhea.  This continued for 2 hours.  I lost 6 pounds.  After continuing with some diarrhea all day on February 12th, I began having bloody mucous chunks as my stool.  I was advised by my doctor to go to the ER.  I was diagnosed with colitis in the ER and was admitted for several days for treatment due to the severe blood coming out.  CT scan showed severe inflammation, and stool sample showed blood and lactoferrin marker high.  I was given many antibiotics and fluids and was released home on February 14th, 2021.  I am still receiving treatment with oral antibiotics, and appointments with my physician.  I had to be absent from work for over 7 days.

                                                Within approximately a couple of days from the first of two COVID19 Pfizer injections, I developed a progressive, systemic, neuro/neuro-muscular inflammatory pain response.  The inflammation and pain first manifested in my left wrist and hand, greatly worsening recent symptomology that may have been the start of a carpal tunnel syndrome.  The inflammation and pain then progressed to my right wrist and hand and right shoulder.  Then they progressed to my left shoulder, under my clavicles, my hips,  and my upper lumbar/lower thoracic region of my spine.  Muscle groups tightened and hurt, chief among them my hamstrings and upper back.  All within days.  The inflammation and pain were severe, especially from the early a.m. (3 or 4 in the a.m.) to waking hours.  And the conditions left me nearly debilitated and incapable of sleeping well or performing many ADLs.  Then, on Monday, March 29, 2021, I saw an orthopaedic for the pains in my wrists and hands, and he prescribed me a steroid for a preliminary diagnose of bilateral carpal tunnel.  The inflammation and pain throughout my body decreased considerably after only two doses of the steroids.  That led me to seek a consultation with the rheumatologist.

Shortly thereafter, I developed a sever headache along with fever, chills and lethargy. Sever body aches followed with joint pain throughout entire body. All symptoms lasted 24-36 hours. 48 hours later, still feeling stiff with aching back muscles and feeling tired.  Large underarm lumps have developed 72 hours after injection. All of the aforementioned occurred after the second injection.

A week later I started to feel very ill; chills, low grade fever, fatigue, sweaty, head ache in the middle of my face, muscle aches, fuzzy thinking, and later a cold sore. I started taking Tylenol and stayed home from work. It has persisted over the past 4 days but I started to feel better yesterday.

It got worse over next few hours and stayed with me all evening. Had a headache as well. The next morning I was 80% better and by the next morning I was fine. The pharmacist told me that most people only get sore arm and sometimes can hardly lift the arm. I had sore arm but nothing I couldn&#39;t deal with. He also said that second shot tends to make people sick. I guess I wanna be certain I should get second vaccine?! I tested positive for covid on 12/20/20 and negative on 1/8/21.

                                                A week after the shot, on Thursday 4/8, I started getting a headache. Overnight, I woke up experiencing sever shivering, aches, and headache. The shivering was so severe it was like all muscles were cramping up. I took a painkiller, and went back to bed. In the morning on Friday 4/9 I awoke very sore and achy and had a bad headache and fatigue. I took more painkiller, had some breakfast, and took the day off to relax.

Patient was hospitalized for management of severe sepsis secondary to Covid pneumonia resulting in acute hypoxic respiratory failure.  Patient was also treated for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia given duration of Covid symptoms prior to coming into hospital.  Patient made nice recovery and was able to wean off from high flow oxygen down to 2 L with exertion.  Patient overall made nice recovery hence he was discharged home.   Patient was noted to have rising D-dimers despite clinical improvement in Covid infection.  He is at high risk for developing DVTs hence he was recommended to use Xarelto 10 mg daily for 1 month to prevent any risk of DVTs.   Patient voiced understanding of this.  In he was discharged home with home health care.   His readmission potential is low to moderate.

About 1/1 had ill feeling, very tired, soreness in joints, extreme pain in arm/ legs. did not have breathing problem.  pain and limited range motion lasted until 1/7/21. I called health clinic and they told me to call cdc number on vaccination card.  That number sent me to reporting center, no help.  Called family physician, they said they knew nothing about vaccine.  Since i wasn?t having breathing problem i just dealt with pain and took Tylenlol couple times each day.  Took second dose vaccine 1/20/21.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

The first dose of the vaccine, the pain started the second day and the injection site got swollen. But this second dose was within 2 hours of my vaccine even more and overwhelming fatigue.  - aches, chills, muscle cramps, coughing, sweating - those lasted three days; headache - ever present and felt like head was in a vice; breathing was an issue - asthma was triggered on Sunday  - I started prednisone  - informal dr consultation with a friend - on Tuesday because of the asthma and by Friday I was feeling halfway better again and by the following Sunday about 75% better. 9 days later I was back at work. It took that week back at work though to get back out of the funk and by the following weekend I was close to 90%. Pain in the shoulder lasted about two weeks - it was quite tender for that long.

It stopped in the evening but got constant low headaches afterwards. Around 5pm, felt like a change in taste (saltier taste) that was temporary. Has uncomfortable wrist pain like twisting a screwdriver too much. Started feeling itchy today after 9 am. Face was swollen after waking up today and has subsided greatly since. Had very low fever last night and now feels like no fever. Right now, feeling has a lot of saliva and then have to swallow and little uncomfortable in arms and knees, and weakness. Only took one Aleve pill last night. Around 4:30pm, felt a little blurry for 5 to 10 seconds.

As day progressed I developed diarrhea and a fever which reached 101.7 in the evening. By Tuesday morning the stomach and back pain were gone, but had a headache and 100.0 fever all day, and frequent diarrhea all day.  By 8pm I am feeling much better and am able to bring the fever down with acetaminophen.

By Friday had biting pain around neck.  Could barely move it on Saturday and Sunday.  Monday the biting pain left and neck pain started to let up.  Tuesday seems like pain is getting better.

                                                I received the vaccine about two - three inches from the center of the muscle and in back of center - it was more in back of deltoid than the front of my deltoid. When I first got the shot, I had a burning sensation from the site of needle to back of neck to behind my ear area. It felt like a burning aching feeling. My ear felt like it was clogged up and aching. I told the medical site about it and the doctor on site said that more likely they hit a nerve. My blood pressure was very elevated. They had me stay to be observed for 45 minutes. I went back to work. I still felt it at night. The next day, I started feeling up my neck and my collarbone and my left side of my face and my head - my face felt tight and my lip felt numb on the left side and I had a slight confusion too. I went to Emergency room. They did CAT Scan and exam. After that, I noticed it was going all the way down my arm, all the left side of my body to toes. It felt like numbness - like neuropathy type feeling. It felt like constant pain. I went to the Urgent Care and they gave me Prednisone steroid (5 days of it) 5 mg to help with inflammation.  I took that for the five days. I started noticing a little black bruising on my body. After that,  I went to the Urgent Care again and they gave me Naproxen  and and Dr gave me more Naproxen to take.  He took bloodwork, too. I went to the ER and I was still feeling sick and hot. They said it was anxiety. I am still going through it - I feel it on the spot where I got the shot - and on my neck and on my head and on my left eye and down on my legs a lot - some days are worse than others but not as bad as when I had the first symptoms.

A 55-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6204), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Mar2021 09:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing high blood pressure (began years ago about 10 years ago, states he has no names or lot numbers of the blood pressure pill). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced chills and shaking. He stated he was probably running a fever but he don&#39;t know.

He checked his temperature and it was either 101 degree F or 100.1 degree F. He was running a fever now of 100.1. Patient stated he had the 1st dose on 23Mar2021 and it was about three days ago and then yesterday (26Mar2021) he liked to froze to death in his house which was 80 degrees and he was covered up and had covers on him. He got ready for work today and when he got up his legs did not want to work and it would have been very easy to fall and when he came in, he fell in the door but his legs were so sore and he was running a fever now of 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit on 26Mar2021. Patient had the Pfizer COVID shot in his left arm and had no soreness or anything like that but stated he was in the hospital for three days trying to get his potassium up on an unspecified date and went through sixteen little bags of concentrated potassium and the first potassium bag was on a drip machine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                The needle was inserted high up on my left shoulder, which was quit painful.  When the vaccine was injected, it caused additional discomfort.  Within 30 minutes, the left shoulder joint became agonizingly pain with any movement and I had loss of mobility.  Several hours later, the pain continued to worsen and any movement of the arm caused debilitating sharp pain.    During the night I used ice packs and took Advil, however the problem continued to worsen.  Today I am very concerned that the vaccine may have caused an injury to my shoulder.

I arrived in time for what I thought was a 12:15 appointment but ended up standing in line for an hour before actually getting the shot.  I was fine the rest of that day aside from developing soreness in the muscles of my right arm.  The following morning, Wednesday, April 14th,  I was awakened to very noticeable soreness in both arms and the back of my neck. As the morning progressed, I developed flu-like symptoms, complete body aches, chills, fever, slight nausea, blurred vision, mild diarrhea.

                                                Development of fever blisters (cold sores).   I&#39;ve had cold sore/fever blister before.  For the past 30 years I would typically get ONE cold sore roughly about every 3-4 years.  Typically it was an indicator I was about to experience an illness.  They were VERY rare and always noted as I will not kiss my children or wife when I would get one.  It would always appear in the exact same location on the upper left part of my top lip.  Very minor cold sore but a cold sore none the less.  My reaction to the 2nd shot was pretty strong.  I had a 102F fever starting at 10PM the evening after the second vaccination.  Very strong muscle contractions and joint inflammation.  The fever and soreness disappeared about 36 hours later and I was fine.  Fast forward a week or two (from the second shot) and I developed an unusual coldsore on my lower lip.  It appeared almost immediately.  I began to apply Abrevia (10% Docosanol) right away.    Honestly it was a very unusual cold sore.  Much larger than any cold sore I had ever had.  It even caused bumps on the  interior part of my lower lip.  This has never happened.    In the past this cold sore would be it.  Then I would be free of them for an extended period.  As of April 21, 2021, I&#39;ve had 2 additional cold sores.   This is three cold sores in a period of less then 5 weeks.  My diet, exercise and lifestyle have not really changed.  This is VERY odd.

I read where this was a side effect.  It has know been 11 days and the pain is getting worse daily and every step I take is about a pain level of 7-8 in my left knee.  It feels like my knee could break at any time.  I am going to wait until 2 weeks after my shot before I call my DR.  I read where side effects could last 2 weeks, but wanted to get this report in.  I am literally walking with a severe limp because of the pain.

Gradually over the last 2 weeks, he has also noted increasing hip and buttock muscle fatigue with walking.  Two nights ago, he developed increasing pain in his left forefoot.  Yesterday, his left foot became numb and he went to Medical Center for evaluation.  While there, he was found to have an ischemic left leg with lack of Doppler signals in his left foot and subsequently underwent CT angiography.  This CT scan demonstrated left internal iliac occlusion, partially occlusive thrombus within the left external iliac artery with widely patent femoral popliteal system bilaterally.  However, his left peroneal and anterior tibial arteries were occluded for segments, while the distal left posterior tibial artery appears occluded, although this may represent contrast bolus timing issues He has no known prior history of thrombotic issues.  He has no family history of clotting abnormalities.  He denies any palpitations or history of cardiac arrhythmia.  He has been in sinus rhythm since his initial presentation.

I noticed it about 24 hours after the shot.   I also have the totally normal soreness at the injection site that persists to this moment. I did have flu like symptoms (body aches, limb weakness arms and legs, malaise) on  4/28/21 from 1pm till 9pm but has resolved.  The First shot I do not remember which arm, I think it was the left but cannot be certain, but I had no side effects at that time.  I also have a very occasional twitch in my right upper arm that persists to this moment which is similar to the twitch in my left arm but is much much less severe and very infrequent.   Note I have specifically nickel allergy and a number of other minor allergies.   I also used to have benign fastulations that were random though my body which resolved  and has not been an issued since 2017.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke.

This 55-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in his left arm on 05Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Arthritis, Sinus problem, Asthma, Bipolar disorder. Concomitant medications were not reported.

The patient experienced injection site pain, severe pain in his left shoulder after that second dose. Some major pain up around his shoulders and around the back of neck, his left side was worst. He said that the pain was shooting down to his heart. So he went to the hospital because he thought it was something to the heart. They tested him, they evaluated him but they ruled out anything that has to do with the heart. They checked his heart, he had a cardiac catheterization, and was ruled out, everything came out negative.  So, he just got out of hospital and was still developing the pain and it&#39;s on his left side, it&#39;s on his right side (as reported). He called all his doctors, they had no answers for him, now he was still in a lot of pain in both of shoulders like he was saying his left side was still the worst, and it has not gone away and the pain is still shooting down around his heart and shooting down around the back of neck and now it&#39;s going on the top of his legs.  He went to the bone doctor and he was getting an MRI done, because the doctors said nothing was torn in his arms or tissues. He stated the pain was around his arms, back and wraps down to the heart. He was in dire pain, 8.5/10 and had a feeling of it was related to the vaccine. He clarified the pain was in both shoulders and the left side was worse and that was the side he had his shot on.  Patient stated he had stomach problems, he was collapsed stomach. The outcome of events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Developed lower back pain, sciatica and skin sensitivity in right hip and leg approximately 10 days after second dose.  Managed pain with OTC medications, stretching and massage over ensuing week as symptoms worsened.  Approximately nine days following onset of symptoms, began developing blisters in patches on lower right leg.  Visited urgent care and confirmed shingles, which is now being treated with valacylovir and predinsone.  Symptoms are abating.  This is my third bout with shingles as an adult.  There is no confirmed linkage to my COVID vaccinations but I thought I should report this as a possible vaccine reaction given the close proximity of shingles onset to my last COVID shot.

A contactable nurse and contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ XR), orally from 02Oct2020 at 11 mg, daily for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 19Dec2020, the patient experienced neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare.  In Dec2020, the patient experienced increase in joint pain from his baseline. The physician was aware. The patient was placed on unspecified steroids for the events, neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare which minimized symptoms. While weaning off steroids, the severity of symptoms returned. The patient was instructed by the doctor to stop taking tofacitinib citrate which was stopped on 29Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable and for tofacitinib citrate was permanently withdrawn on 29Dec2020.  The patient reported slight improvement after stopping tofacitinib citrate.  The outcome of neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare was recovering and of increase in joint pain from his baseline was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, the reported events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors and unlikely that it is related to the suspect product. However due to temporal association with the vaccine, a possible contributory role of vaccine cannot be ruled out. Case will be reevaluated based on additional information during the follow-up.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

                                                I was symptom free when I went to bed four hours after vaccination.  In the middle of that first night (03/02/21), I awoke with an overall body ache, which persisted through the next day.  In the morning of the next day (03/03/21), I awoke with soreness at the vaccination site, tightness in my chest, and a swollen, red left ankle.  The overall achiness and sore arm were understandable, but the chest tightness made we wonder if inflammation in the region persisted from my cardiac ablation in May 2020 and was aggravated by the covid vaccine.  I have a Kardia home-test ECG monitor, and the results of the test continue to be &#34;normal.&#34;  As far as the ankle, an MRI in August 2020 determined that I had torn my peroneal brevis tendon.  After six weeks in a walking boot, I began physical therapy and noticed that if I exerted myself too much that I would get swelling and soreness.  Everything in my ankle was healed by October 2020, and I have been hiking / running four times a week since without incident.  I did not injure myself before the vaccination, so it seems to much of a coincidence that inflammation returned to my previously injured ankle just hours after receiving the covid vaccine.

                                                First injection - only a sore right deltoid (injection site).  Fairly intense but only lasted 24 hours and easily alleviated by Tylenol. Second injection - Ringing in my ears - noticeable starting about 9pm the day of the second injection (3/11/21) and it&#39;s still going strong.  Intensity of ringing has remained constant to date unfortunately.  Headache was minor and on &amp; off starting the night of the injection date and appear to still encounter them but intensity has been low.  Taken Tylenol to alleviate symptom with success.  Soreness at injection site - less intense on second shot than first but it lasted about 48 hours.  The Tylenol I took for the headache seemed to help with the arm pain.  On the day after the injection, my right latissimus dorsi (same side as shot) became sore but only for about 24 hours. Tiredness - didn&#39;t feel the exhaustion until about 9pm on the day of the injection.  Exhaustion/tiredness set in more than expected so very low activity the day after and went to bed several hours earlier than normal.  Still feeling tired but emerging from that as i&#39;m starting to feel more energy come back.

This would be the end of the rib at the center of my chest. I didn?t think much of it at that time. When I woke up around 0600, the pain was throughout the center of my chest. The more I exerted myself, the greater the pain. I also had a headache and neck pain. After 36 hours, I was fine. I didn?t go to the ER as I felt that the problem was muscular. My heart felt fine.

Likely unrelated, developed right knee, calf and foot pain and had numbness in 2 left foot inner toes, off and on for 3-4 days after fever broke.  Took 2 Advil, pain completely disappeared by 2 days later.  I have arthritis and have had 2 right/1 left knee surgeries, and the temperature rose right about the time the pain disappeared, but the cold has returned and no pain.  Just odd, almost like a side effect of producing anti-bodies was excessive inflammation in parts of my body prone to inflammation.   I get the flu vaccine every year, and I have flu-like symptoms (chills, aches, low-grade fever) for several days within 24 hrs every year.

I received the covid vaccine and continued my normal routine of distancing, mask, hand washing. 2 weeks after I began to feel extremely tired, headache, chills, muscle aches, cough and after 6 days went to walkin in and tested negative for covid and positive for flu type A. Dr said it was extremely rare as they had not seen any case of flu this season.

                                                After 20 minutes I lost feeling in the left side of my face.  It also radiated down my left arm.  It subsided after 7 hours and was gone after 18 hours.  The following morning I woke to a sore back in an area I have had issues with.  The pain progressed and has gotten worse over the past two months.  I have gone from training for a triathlon to only being able to walk about one mile with pain.  I am in pain 24 hours a day now.

                                                Inflamation and pain on left side of the body, beginning in the arm/shoulder and spreading to neck and left tonsil.  Tonsil swelling was quite pronounced by 2am (nearly twelve hours after the injection) and blocked the airway when head was turned to the left, necessitating a makeshift pillow brace to keep head turned to the right overnight.  Tonsil swelling began to diminish by about 6am and only slight enlargement remains thirty hours after injection.  Additionally, a low-grade fever began at about 10 pm (~7 hours after injection) and reached a maximum of 100.5 degrees F approximately twenty-four hours after the injection.  By twenty-eight hours, temperature was within normal limits (though still nearly a degree higher than typical for this patient).  As of this writing, some thirty hours after the injection, headache, neck ache, and eye-ache persist, but none is severe.  Symptoms appear to be continuing their improvement.  I (the patient/recipient) hope the second installment of the vaccine is no worse than this one.  The only truly alarming symptom was the swollen tonsil and some thought was given to seeking medical attention, but the pillow brace seemed to do the trick for keeping the airway open, so no assistance was sought.   I have no doubt that these short-lived symptoms are much better than actual disease and I will not hesitate to follow up with the second vaccine installment?but I will monitor the tonsil situation very carefully.

                                                After receiving the second dose of COVID on April 10th,  my husband experienced chills, muscle pain, fatigue and a low-grade fever. On the 4th day after vaccination, he started having a temporal headache that first was throbbing in the temple on left side of his head and tender to the touch. the headache was persistent for several days, and then, started coming and going until was gone. Overall, he had those headaches for about 10 days. I did report about this side effect to his PCP.

When I removed my shirt, I noticed that the injection site (as indicated by the location of the bandaid) was in an unusual location.  Instead of in my shoulder muscle, the injection site was further back toward the back side of my shoulder joint.   My shoulder pain got worse throughout the day and I continue to experience pain when I lift my arm over my head or when I put weight on it while laying down.  I have trouble sleeping with this pain.

If he was too happy or too nervous get upset. He can eat spicy food, not super hot, but he can eat anything and it doesn&#39;t go crazy. He has a little bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes. He can&#39;t take a multivitamin or supplements because he would get sick to his stomach, this was before the vaccine. He was getting that same sick feeling now that he would get if he was taking a multivitamin. He had his blood drawn a week before he had the vaccine to check his kidneys with the pills he is on. It was perfect and normal, and he has had nothing since then. In his 20s he had the flu vaccine, and he had never had the flu in his life. That year he got the worse flu sick of his life. He never got the flu vaccine or other vaccines after that. That was probably between 1987 to 1990. His folks passed away. He had been in the hospital when he was little.Concomitant medications included acetaminophen taken for back pain, sciatica from an unspecified start date and ongoing; nabumetone taken for sciatica, back pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient experienced he passed out for 2 days (medically significant) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, been sick pretty much everyday (non-serious) on 07Apr2021 22:00 with outcome of not recovered, not feeling good in his stomach (non-serious) on 07Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, slept all day for several days (non-serious) on 08Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, responding strangely to people/but is still there and is so weird (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting (non-serious) on 15Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, his whole torso hurt and his stomach (non-serious) on 15Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, diarrhea (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, getting really irritable (non-serious) on 09Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, he had no energy (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of recovering, he was lethargic/weakness (asthenia) (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, dizzy (non-serious) on 10Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast (non-serious) on 17Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, breathing hard (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, wouldn&#39;t feel good (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, arm started hurting where he got the shot (non-serious) on 08Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, headache (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, his arm was a little sore (non-serious) on 13Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, a fast heartbeat (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, chills (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown. Patient got sick around 10:00 at night. He was supposed to get his second dose but he was so sick and they said lets give it a week. Then he talked to his doctor and he said to wait 2-3 weeks to make sure he is back to normal. So he is scheduled for the second dose next week at 6 weeks. He asked if it was okay that the shot was given in the sunlight. He stated that he saw that it was in an ice chest but the person had to walk it over to him 20 feet and deal with his sleeve for a second or two so it was in the sun. He said all that walking it was 100% in the sun and he has read that it should not be in the sun. He asked if this could have caused bacteria and caused his symptoms. He stated his doctor was only concerned about giving him antibiotics for bacteria if it was in the sun and if that was a problem. He just read from CDC, once mixed the vaccine can be left at room temp for 6 hours and mixed vaccine does not need to be protected from light. So it sounds like his first shot was good. He had gotten the shot at about 1430 in the afternoon. He was like he is going to get the shot and everything will be great. He didn&#39;t think there would be an effect. Then strangely enough at about 2200 he was about to eat dinner and he got to not feeling good in his stomach. It had been close to 8 hours. The next day he slept all day, got up and had coffee, and Saturday he was in the chair in the living room. He is never in the chair during the day because he works. He slept all day and all night and the next day. He was responding strangely to people, and he was in and out of it. He had the shot on Wednesday and then his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting. He has back pain anyway and bone spurs on his spine. He was telling his wife whatever pain he is normally in was enhanced. His whole torso hurt and his stomach. The following Monday he had diarrhea. Then he started getting really irritable and didn&#39;t want to talk and was impatient. He was lethargic and had no energy. That was the second week. By the end of the second week he had a couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast. He thought it was a heart attack, then thought it was just pain not a heart attack. Every time he wouldn&#39;t feel good he would start breathing hard. Once in a while he gets pain through his chest area. His stomach would start and he would breath hard every time he didn&#39;t feel good. The third week he was supposed to get the second shot. He called the department of health for New Mexico. The nurse called back and said not to do the shot that week but to wait a week. He rescheduled for a week later. By the third week he was still not feeling good and called the doctor. He asked about the pain in his chest 3 times and he said it seemed to be okay. His arm started hurting where he got the shot in the second week. He still had no energy and he told the doctor this. Patient started taking 2 extra Tylenol during the day for pain. Lately he has been good until one little thing and then all of a sudden his stomach is hurting and he is holding his stomach. He was good today, all he did was eat a cookie and he didn&#39;t get sick. He was worse for a little while in the first or second week, he was really bad. It came and went over the next 2 weeks and now it is coming and going less frequently. He slept through 2 or 3 days. Thursday, Friday, and then Saturday he was in and out. He woke up to take the garbage out on Friday then saw he already took it out and forgot it was out there. And it was Saturday. He was kind of out of it. When he would respond strangely he would respond with a question he just asked and someone answered. It is like brain fog or like he is on something. It started after the weekend, more on 12Apr2021. Once in a while he will forget a little something still, but just once in a while. He would walk and hold his rib cage with both arms when he was hurting. He wrote down that it felt like somebody had hit him in the back with a bat in the lower back. One day it was that bad. His back pain was on Thursday 15Apr2021. The pain now is not like where it hit him with the back. He has back pain every day but more than he used to. The sore like he was hit in the back pain was just the one day. He had diarrhea 12Apr2021, 13Apr2021, and 14Apr2021 then it left for probably a week. Then it came back last week one day. Instead of every day it was every 3 or 4 days. He has not had it in the last 4 days. He hopes it is done. He noticed any time he has salad or lettuce he feels bad in the morning so he stopped eating those. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. The irritable feeling started right away the Friday of the week he got the shot. He is still struggling some, it will come and go. Yesterday he was zonked. With having no energy it is a big thing. He has to do something instead of what he would be doing. He works all day and takes long orders and stuff. Now he does like one order when normally he did 10. One for him is a huge little sore so he will lay on his right side. His left arm still hurts like a pulling hurt from his neck to his arm. It has been every day from 13Apr2021. It is much better and he will move and it will relax a little bit. It was really weird. The whole time he held the phone with his left hand up until one second he moved his phone and it was the same pain. At night the left side where he had the injection pulls on his neck muscle coming from his arm. He was actually taking two Tylenol in the morning and two at night when he went to bed. With the pain he takes 2 during the day, 650mg each. He was just taking 500mg and then his wife said take these. It seems to have gotten a little better. He always took them 2 times a day and now he takes them 3 times a day. After the first dose he experienced difficulty breathing dizziness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, chills, nausea, headache, he passed out for 2 days and has been sick for 5 weeks. He started having some dizziness a couple of days later and reports, it&#39;s like I would stand up too quickly and get a head rush, that kind of dizzy feeling. He confirmed that his dizziness did not start until a couple of days after he received his first dose.

A 56-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 11:15 (at the age of 56-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Penicillin allergy, pain, arthritis, was hospitalized when the patient was small for 15 days in a bubble following an allergic reaction, and had knee surgery. Concomitant medications included ongoing vitamin c [ascorbic acid] taken to make sure he doesn&#39;t catch a cold; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN BAYER) taken for pain, arthritis, and as a preventative to make sure he doesn&#39;t get any clogs; and ongoing ascorbic acid, betacarotene, biotin, boron, calcium, calcium pantothenate, chloride, chromium, colecalciferol, copper, cyanocobalamin, folic acid, iodine, iron, lycopene, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, nicotinamide, phosphorus, potassium, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, silicon dioxide, thiamine, tin, tocopheryl acetate, vanadium, vitamin k nos, zinc (CENTRUM MEN) taken for multi-vitamins, after a certain age you need to take a multi vitamin. On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t move his body, wasn&#39;t feeling like himself, he started having chills, shivering, and fever yesterday (29Mar2021) then had a rapid test and he came positive, and butt cheeks hurt; on an unspecified date, scalp hurt, and everything hurts. Brushing his teeth hurts. It was further reported that they went to take a rapid test in the morning of 30Mar2021 and he came positive. The patient didn&#39;t have problems Friday/Saturday/Sunday. Yesterday (29Mar2021), he woke up and he felt like he&#39;s been having aches and pains and when he took a shower, washing his head hurt. And his butt cheeks hurt from sitting down. He&#39;s allergic to penicillin and they kept them there for 30 minutes. Everything was fine. No side effects from Friday through Sunday. But yesterday (29Mar2021), he started having chills, shivering, and fever. Additionally, it was reported that the patient was tested for Covid-19 prior to getting vaccinated and the results were negative. The wife also clarified that last night, 29Mar2021, the patient had chills, couldn&#39;t move his body, and had a temperature of 101-102. Therefore, they both made an appointment to get tested at 09:30 this morning (30Mar2021) to get tested. The patient&#39;s test came back positive. The wife again states they are going back tomorrow for a rapid and mouth Covid-19 test. Furthermore, it was reported that yesterday (29Mar2021), her husband woke up and wasn&#39;t feeling like himself. In the night, he was hot, shivering, and his temperature got up to 101. The patient&#39;s temperature was not so high this morning but that he still wasn&#39;t feeling himself. He began not feeling like himself yesterday morning, 29Mar2021. The patient confirmed that he still feels unlike himself today. The wife also reported that every time her husband would move he said that everything hurts. Brushing his teeth hurts. He even said his butt cheeks hurt. When her husband was taking a bath and passed the soap over his head, his scalp hurt. The wife makes the comment that this isn&#39;t like her husband. The patient works like a mule and doesn&#39;t complain about anything. That&#39;s why the wife got worried. For example, the patient had knee surgery and walked out limping but did not use a cane because that was the kind of man he is. He was not whiner so when he tells you something&#39;s wrong, something&#39;s wrong. The patient&#39;s second dose was scheduled 16Apr2021. The patient was allergic to the penicillin class in generalized. When the patient was small, he was hospitalized for 15 days in a bubble following an allergic reaction. The wife reported that the patient drinks (takes) every day religiously one Centrum for men, one Vitamin c, and an aspirin. She clarified all the medications that her husband drinks (takes) he has been on for at least 10 years, since he was 35 or 40 years old, tops. All of these medications are approved by the doctor. She mentions when she try and give her husband a pill, he just looks at it. He won&#39;t even drink (take) a Tylenol. Her husband works construction and was around a lot of dust. Sometimes, he will work with Clorox and stuff like that cleaning towers, so he just takes Vitamin C to stay safe. Their son was a vet and when her husband helps their son with the animals, he takes it to make sure he was clean. She also clarified that her husband drinks (takes) the aspirin that was for arthritis because he&#39;s 57 and has worked very hard. She believes the dose was 325 or 500, she was not sure. She clarified further it&#39;s the aspirin that&#39;s for body and aches. His doctor doesn&#39;t let him take any more than one tablet daily in case he gets cut, he could bleed. The patient takes the aspirin daily because both his dad and mom died of aneurysms so he was told to take an aspirin daily to make sure his arteries and everything are clean. It&#39;s a preventative to make sure he doesn&#39;t get any clogs and for the pain. She makes the comment unfortunately, their son that&#39;s 35 had to have 2 open heart surgeries. She and her husband have not been in contact with anyone. They have 3 small grandkids and a son with a history of open heart surgery. The wife reported that she and her husband live in a bubble. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101-102 on 29Mar2021 and COVID-19 test which was negative on an unspecified date in Mar2021 and then became positive   on 30Mar2021. On an unspecified date, the patient recovered from COVID-19 while outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

I exp fatigue and couldn&#39;t sleep  I went to ER HR 180/10, elevated HR/BP, muscle joint pain and tremendous back pain. After I followed up with my PCP still elevated BP 140/70  as a result I&#39;m on blood pressure medication. I was advised to stay on this new medicine until I receive the second dose of the vaccine. Also was told to take Benadryl and Tylenol before taking 2nd Covid vaccine.

                                                I developed severe back pain from an old injury. The back pain was far more painful this time and I had a 25 minute long shivering attack (rigors?). I was admitted to Piedmont for observation (I had an intermittent fever) and tested for everything. All results; MRI, CT, Echocardiogram, showed normal for my age. The pain is better and improving but it?s still been significantly longer lasting than any previous time. My PCP suggested I post this info to the CDC website but I wanted to let you know in case you were compiling any info related to symptoms/side effects.

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

This is the second of two reports. The reporter describes events following both vaccinations in a vaccine series. This report is for those events which occurred following the second vaccination.      A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3249), intramuscularly on 01Feb2021  (at the age of 57-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia from an unknown date. The patient&#39;s historical vaccinations included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 after which he experienced inflammation, joint pain and burning sensation in the joints. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The vaccination was administered at a hospital. Concomitant medications included acetaminophen (TYLENOL), tamulosin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) all from unspecified dates and for unknown indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Per the reporting physician, he got his first vaccine on 22Dec2020.  His MCP and PIP joints and SI joints started burning close to 3rd week in Jan2021. He had some minor SI pains intermittently before but none with hands. Continued hurting enough that he started taking Osteobiflex and fish oil and more tylenol for inflammation. After second vaccine on 01Feb2021 the symptoms he experienced after the first dose have been getting worse.  He mentioned that his hands burn all the time, at times like tonight bad enough that they keep him awake.  He has red nodular areas on some of his knuckles and a distinct nodule at the proximal ulnar aspect of my left 4th finger PIP that is uniformly erythematous. Not all knuckles have the same degree of burning, but all including thumbs have it. The SI joint pain is more variable and at time does not bother him, but the hands get swollen and tight to close everyday. He plans to start some prednisone tomorrow due to the progression of the burning. The clinical outcomes of the events burning sensation in joints worsened, swelling of hands, stiffness joints, inflammation, condition worsended, erythema, nodule on extremity were reported as not recovered. The outcomes of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administration and off label use were unknown.  It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021154881 Same patient, same drug, different AE, different dose of vaccine.

                                                Initially minor soreness at injection site (no problem), the afternoon of the injection. That evening, I had slight headache, tiredness, and chills. Next morning, &#34;pinching feeling&#34; in left underarm. After continuing to feel this, I finally went and looked and found a &#34;red spot&#34; at the point of the greatest soreness and also noted swelling of the general area. This soreness has continued on through to today (3/29/2021).

A 57-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 57-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today. The reported adverse events resulted to an emergency room and physician office visit (went to the orthopedist). The patient received corrective treatment as response to the reported events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I had my first Covid vaccine (Pfizer - Lot ER2613) on March 17.  No issues other than a soar arm the next day.  In fact, I went on a hard 7 mile run the next day as part of my normal training routine (currently training for a half Marathon.)  This past Thursday, April 8, at 6:00 pm EST, I had my 2nd shot (Lot EW0161).  For about the next 18 hours, I was fine other than the arm being a little sore in the morning. Late in the morning I noticed my back was getting very stiff and a bit sore when I moved around.  I have a desk job and spend a lot of time in front of the computer, but I normally stretch and move throughout most days, so I don?t have many back issues.  This was a bit worse than normal.  Usually, when I feel something like this, my go to remedy is an easy run.  I had a 5 mile easy run planned for that day, so later in the afternoon, after some dynamic stretching, I went for a run.  As I started, I felt some of the worse back pain I could remember and stopped running after about 50 yards.  I stretched a little more, questioning if I should continue, but decided that movement would be better than doing nothing.  I started running again and although the first mile was much more uncomfortable and painful than normal, I continued on for the 5 miles with everything eventually loosening up as the blood starting flowing.  I felt pretty good the rest of the day and into the evening.  In the middle of the night, I awoke numerous times with a bad ache in my back, which is very unusual for me. I tossed and turned all night from side to side, from front to back but could not stop the burn and pain in my lower back.  I took 2 Advil, but that did little to help.  I got out of bed about an hour earlier than normal and after a little light stretching, my back felt fine again.  I went for my weekly long 14 mile run an hour later and everything was good again and for the rest of the day.  The next 3 days / nights have been similar.  I continue waking each night with a burning and aching in my lower back and it continues all night long.  Once I stand up, get out of bed and start moving around, the pain and burning go away almost immediately.  I?ve never felt anything like this before.  I?m 57, male, am very healthy and fit (aiming for a 1:30 half marathon in 10 days.)  Never had issues with sleeping before this and haven?t experienced any back pain in a very long time.  I can?t think of anything I?ve done recently to trigger this other than the coincidence of the 2nd Pfizer vaccine shot.

The pain was evident after sitting or laying down for 10&#43; minutes. During nighttime sleep, the pain does not allow me to move my lower extremities without intense pain keeping me awake and only allowing less than 2 hours of sleep a night. Prior to March 12, I was physically fit and active. I was able to ride a stationary bike, treadmill and attend fitness classes. Now, I need to walk with a cane and I was diagnosed with &#34;arthritis&#34; symptoms as well as micro tears in my left knee. My left knee swells so much that I am unable to bend it without great pain.

On 06Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 6 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalized due to pneumonia and remained hospitalized at the time of reporting. The patient was also hospitalized in 23Mar2021 for COVID. Since 06Apr2021, the patient remained hospitalized due to COVID. On 16Apr2021, the patient had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID, AHRF secondary to Influenza B exacerbating PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (acute respiratory failure, hospitalized, medically significant), pulmonary hypertension (pHTN) exacerbation, AHRF (acute hypoxemic respiratory failure) secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, pHTN treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hospitalized and medically significant), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (influenza, hospitalized), volume overload (fluid overload, hospitalized). On 16Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 16 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalised due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID and for AHRF secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, then transferred to the other hospital with volume overload and diuresis. The patient was presented with volume overload and needed oxygen requirement (none needed at home prior to both hospitalizations). The patient&#39;s breathing and oxygen were improved with diuresis. Patient&#39;s pulmonary hypertension was treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus. Patient was given intravenous (IV) solumedrol (25 mg in AM and 16 mg in PM) as per the discussion with rheumatology and pulmonary hypertension cardiology with improvement in oxygen status. On 24Apr2021, the patient relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included: complete blood count (CBC) WBC (white blood count) 4.79, RBC (Red blood cell count) 3.31, Hgb (hemoglobin) 8.4, Plt (Platelet count) 146. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) Na (sodium) 141, K (potassium) 4.1, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 39, Creatinine 1.68, glucose 90. On 25Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.51, RBC 3.24, Hgb 8.2, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 39, Creatinine 1.59, glucose 117. On 26Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.41, RBC 3.30, hgb 8.3, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 37, creatinine 1.54, and glucose 90. The patient was discharged on 26Apr2021. Patient&#39;s physical exam at the time of discharge showed pulse 65 bpm, respiratory rate 18 per minute, blood pressure (BP) 138/78 mmHg, temperature 36.5 °C and weight was 90.9 kg. The patient was breathing comfortably in no distress on 2 Litre nasal cannula (NC). Minimal crackles appreciated in the morning posteriorly. The patient had 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs and edema unchanged but overall leg size decreased. Continues to be pitting but improved on the day of discharge. Patient&#39;s discharge diagnosis pulmonary hypertension exacerbation. Patient&#39;s diuretics were increased from 40 mg daily to 60 mg daily and may needed more diuretics. Discharge medications included: Protonix (pantoprazole), Demadex (torsemide), Medrol (methylprednisolone), Citracal &#43; d (calcium citrate, ergocalciferol), Lanoxin (digoxin), Epipen (epinephrine), Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), Folvite (folic acid), Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine sulfate). Patient&#39;s medications of Pepcid, Lasix, and Aldactone were stopped after discharge from the hospital. The patient was instructed to take pantoprazole 40 mg daily while on steroids and when steroids tapered, he had to discontinue it in future and would stop pantoprazole and resume taking home dose of famotidine. Patient was on nifedipine at home and physician thought to be the contributing factor to lower extremity edema so stopped taking the nifedipine in house. It was reported that steroid induced the diabetes. It was reported that the patient needs transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) due to had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) but not agreeable at that time. The patient tried ethacrynic acid 50 mg daily but felt it was not making a difference with his weight. The patient went back on the Bumex (bumetanide) on Friday. Patient&#39;s weight slowly coming down to see doing good later on Bumex, his rash subsiding and leg was healing. Patient&#39;s weight was stable at 155 lbs and had multifactorial stable shortness of breath (SOB). Patient&#39;s weight was above baseline and needed more diuretics. Patient had been in touch with his COVID positive brother who was symptomatic and refused to be covid testing quarantining at that time. On 24Feb2021, the patient got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and his temperature was 101.1 °F. The patient would take Tylenol (paracetamol) and monitor if fever persists to 48 hours he would go to the urgent care. Patient was started on Eliquis and felt much better and no longer to had temperatures and diarrhea. On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, CI 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight since discharge from the hospital. Action taken with PO Orenitram dose due to the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was updated to dose decreased and for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. Action taken with nifedipine, and Medrol dose for the events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. Action taken with COVID-19 Vaccine was not applicable. The outcome of the events of rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events of pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unreported date in 2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect products was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.   Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia, and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available,The casual association between the reported events and suspected vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient was treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus. Patient was given intravenous (IV) solumedrol (25 mg in AM and 16 mg in PM) as per the discussion with rheumatology and pulmonary hypertension cardiology with improvement in oxygen status. On 24Apr2021, the patient relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included: WBC (white blood count) 4.79, RBC (Red blood cell count) 3.31, Hgb (hemoglobin) 8.4, Plt (Platelet count) 146. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) Na (sodium) 141, K (potassium) 4.1, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 39, Creatinine 1.68, glucose 90. On 25Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.51, RBC 3.24, Hgb 8.2, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 39, Creatinine 1.59, glucose 117. On 26Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.41, RBC 3.30, hgb 8.3, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 37, creatinine 1.54, and glucose 90. The patient was discharged on 26Apr2021.  Patient&#39;s physical exam at the time of discharge showed pulse 65 bpm, respiratory rate 18 per minute, blood pressure (BP) 138/78 mmHg, temperature 36.5 C and weight was 90.9 kg. The patient was breathing comfortably in no distress on 2 Litre nasal cannula (NC). Minimal crackles appreciated in the morning posteriorly. The patient had 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs and edema unchanged but overall leg size decreased. Continues to be pitting but improved on the day of discharge. Patient&#39;s discharge diagnosis pulmonary hypertension exacerbation. Patient&#39;s diuretics were increased from 40 mg daily to 60 mg daily and may needed more diuretics. Discharge medications included: Protonix (pantoprazole), Demadex (torsemide), Medrol (methylprednisolone), Citracal &#43; d (calcium citrate, ergocalciferol), Lanoxin (digoxin), EpiPen (epinephrine), Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), Folvite (folic acid), Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine sulfate). Patient&#39;s medications of Pepcid, Lasix, and Aldactone were stopped after discharge from the hospital. The patient was instructed to take pantoprazole 40 mg daily while on steroids and when steroids tapered, he had to discontinue it in future and would stop pantoprazole and resume taking home dose of famotidine. Patient was on nifedipine at home and physician thought to be the contributing factor to lower extremity edema so stopped taking the nifedipine in house. It was reported that steroid induced the diabetes. It was reported that the patient needs transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) due to had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) but not agreeable at that time. The patient tried ethacrynic acid 50 mg daily but felt it was not making a difference with his weight. The patient went back on the Bumex (bumetanide) on Friday. Patient&#39;s weight slowly coming down to see doing good later on Bumex, his rash subsiding and leg was healing. Patient&#39;s weight was stable at 155 lbs and had multifactorial stable shortness of breath (SOB). Patient&#39;s weight was above baseline and needed more diuretics. Patient had been in touch with his COVID positive brother who was symptomatic and refused to be covid testing quarantining at that time. In 2021, the patient got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and his temperature was 101.1 F. The patient would take Tylenol (paracetamol) and monitor if fever persists to 48 hours he would go to the urgent care. Patient was started on Eliquis and felt much better and no longer to had temperatures and diarrhea. On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, ci 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight since discharge from the hospital. In 2021, the patient experienced had fever, temperature 101.1 F. On an unknown date, the patient experienced had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation), steroid induced diabetes, lower extremity edema, 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs, weight slowly coming down, weight up 4 lbs, rash, diarrhea, and leg healing (limb discomfort). In 2021, patient weight was up by 4 lbs since discharge from hospital. The action for nifedipine in response to the events was unknown. The action for methylprednisolone in response to the events was unknown. The action for treprostinil diolamin in response to the events was unknown. The outcome of the events COVID-19 pneumonia, drug ineffective, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation was unknown. The outcome of the events rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unknown date in 2021.  Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia , and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the consistency with the known safety profile of the suspect product BNT162B2, events of COVID-19 pneumonia, Drug ineffective, Fever, Diarrhea could be related to the suspected drug of BNT162B2. All the other events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.  The reported events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Nifedipine.  The events of Diabetes steroid-induced is most likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus. All the other events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Medrol.   Medical history of ongoing Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH/ High BP disorder/ increased pressure of pulmonary circulation), ongoing Systemic lupus erythematosus, and ongoing Dyspnoea may provide explanations for some of the events (such as Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Volume overload, Mitral regurgitation, and Oedema peripheral).   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Since 06Apr2021, the patient remained hospitalized due to COVID (previously reported COVID-19 pneumonia). Follow-up information was received on 27Apr2021, from a nurse on behalf of the reporting physician via a query response. On 16Apr2021, the patient had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID, AHRF secondary to Influenza B exacerbating PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (acute respiratory failure, hospitalized, medically significant), pulmonary hypertension (pHTN) exacerbation, AHRF (acute hypoxemic respiratory failure) secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, pHTN treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hospitalized and medically significant), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (influenza, hospitalized), volume overload (fluid overload, hospitalized). On an unreported date in 2021, the patient had fever, temperature 101.1 F (pyrexia). On an unreported date, the patient had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) (mitral valve incompetence, medically significant), steroid induced diabetes (steroid diabetes, medically significant), lower extremity edema, 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs (oedema peripheral), weight slowly coming down, weight up 4 lbs (weight fluctuation), rash (rash), diarrhea (diarrhoea), and leg healing (limb discomfort). On 16Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 16 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalised due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID (previously reported COVID-19 pneumonia) and for AHRF secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, then transferred to the other hospital with volume overload and diuresis. The patient was presented with volume overload and needed oxygen requirement (none needed at home prior to both hospitalizations). The patient&#39;s breathing and oxygen were improved with diuresis. Patient&#39;s pulmonary hypertension was treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus. Patient was given intravenous (IV) solumedrol (25 mg in AM and 16 mg in PM) as per the discussion with rheumatology and pulmonary hypertension cardiology with improvement in oxygen status. On 24Apr2021, the patient relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included: complete blood count (CBC) WBC (white blood count) 4.79, RBC (Red blood cell count) 3.31, Hgb (hemoglobin) 8.4, Plt (Platelet count) 146.

The patient was discharged on 26Apr2021. Patient&#39;s physical exam at the time of discharge showed pulse 65 bpm, respiratory rate 18 per minute, blood pressure (BP) 138/78 mmHg, temperature 36.5 °C and weight was 90.9 kg. The patient was breathing comfortably in no distress on 2 Litre nasal cannula (NC). Minimal crackles appreciated in the morning posteriorly. The patient had 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs and edema unchanged but overall leg size decreased. Continues to be pitting but improved on the day of discharge. Patient&#39;s discharge diagnosis pulmonary hypertension exacerbation. Patient&#39;s diuretics were increased from 40 mg daily to 60 mg daily and may needed more diuretics. Discharge medications included: Protonix (pantoprazole), Demadex (torsemide), Medrol (methylprednisolone), Citracal &#43; d (calcium citrate, ergocalciferol), Lanoxin (digoxin), Epipen (epinephrine), Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), Folvite (folic acid), Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine sulfate). Patient&#39;s medications of Pepcid, Lasix, and Aldactone were stopped after discharge from the hospital. The patient was instructed to take pantoprazole 40 mg daily while on steroids and when steroids tapered, he had to discontinue it in future and would stop pantoprazole and resume taking home dose of famotidine. Patient was on nifedipine at home and physician thought to be the contributing factor to lower extremity edema so stopped taking the nifedipine in house. It was reported that steroid induced the diabetes. It was reported that the patient needs transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) due to had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) but not agreeable at that time. The patient tried ethacrynic acid 50 mg daily but felt it was not making a difference with his weight. The patient went back on the Bumex (bumetanide) on Friday. Patient&#39;s weight slowly coming down to see doing good later on Bumex, his rash subsiding and leg was healing. Patient&#39;s weight was stable at 155 lbs and had multifactorial stable shortness of breath (SOB). Patient&#39;s weight was above baseline and needed more diuretics. Patient had been in touch with his COVID positive brother who was symptomatic and refused to be covid testing quarantining at that time. On 24Feb2021, the patient got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and his temperature was 101.1 °F in 2021. The patient would take Tylenol (paracetamol) and monitor if fever persists to 48 hours he would go to the urgent care. Patient was started on Eliquis and felt much better and no longer to had temperatures and diarrhea. On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, CI 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID-19 swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight in Apr 2021 since discharge from the hospital. Action taken with PO Orenitram dose due to the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was updated to dose decreased and for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. Action taken with nifedipine, and Medrol dose for the events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation was unknown. The outcome of the events of rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events of pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unreported date in 2021. The reporter did not provide causality for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea, and limb discomfort. Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B.

Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities. Information on the batch/Lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known safety profile, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of drug ineffective, COVID-19, pneumonia, rash, pyrexia and diarrhoea cannot be excluded. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was secondary to COVID-19, therefore was also considered as related to BNT162B2. The other events were considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to BNT162B2. Steroid diabetes was considered as related to methylprednisolone and other events were unrelated to methylprednisolone. Oedema peripheral and limb discomfort were considered as related to nifedipine and other events were unrelated to nifedipine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), intramuscularly on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Concomitant medication included hypertension medications in two weeks. The patient was presumed neg covid status prior to vaccine. He worked as a Pulm/critical care physician. He reported fever, myalgia, fatigue on 16Dec2020. Next day (17Dec2020), he took off from work due to his symptoms. The following day (18Dec2020), he came to work. He c/o ongoing severe fatigue &amp; hand weakness in am. Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care. Full course was unknown but had rebleed there with low plts. Adverse event (he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis) resulted in hospitalization (22 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability/incapacitating or permanent damage. Treatment was received for adverse events. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient: on 18Dec2020, Nasal Swab test: negative. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, on 22Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID 19 immunization. Relevant medical history included COVID infection last Apr2020. On the peak of the COVID pandemic he had the COVID infection, he lost the sense of taste and smell, had diarrhea although he did not have fever and did not have coughing. He also has medical history of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome. He was tested for COVID, he was positive 2 times and then they did PET scan, MRI from head to toe. They were looking for tumor, neuroblastoma, what was causing the shaking, the myoclonus, the opsoclonus, the ataxia, they could not find anything. They gave him convalescent plasma and then they gave him immunoglobulin human normal (IVIG) 5 doses and they gave him high dose of steroid to the point that his blood sugar was reaching sky high they have to give him insulin. He was hospitalized 2 times, 3rd time was 2 days and sent home and then it got worst, so he was readmitted for another &#39;3&#39; days. So, he was sent home on clonazepam, it makes him drowsy and he went for physical therapy and slowly after almost after 8 weeks his symptoms disappear, and he was able to go back to work. His symptoms all recovered by the end of May, towards the beginning of Jun2020 he went back for the swab test, it was negative, COVID PCR negative and my antibody was positive. Concomitant medications included clonazepam, metformin and simvastatin. Patient went back to work and have no symptoms until this 07Jan2020. Like almost 3 week or two and half weeks after he received the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Two and half weeks later he started having symptoms like shaking of the hands that I could barely write and yesterday he could barely walk down the stairs. The patient received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 22Dec2020. Immediately after the vaccination the patient felt that his hands became weak. He ignored it because it went away, like after a minute or so it went away. He went home and nothing happened, except for the soreness of the arm the injection site for 2 days, which really did not bother him. Then this past Thursday, 07Jan2021, he went to the church, he was lightning a candle and his hands started to shake, he can barely light a candle. He was able to do it although his hands were shaking. So, he went home. He ate breakfast, and called his neurologist and he said just to observe and then it went away. On Saturday night (09Jan2021) he noticed that his hands were shaking again when he was typing in the keyboard. He can manage to type but his hands were shaking. He went to sleep and just ignored it. Then yesterday, Sunday he worked again, it became worse, his handwriting was shaking. He was really holding on to the pen to write legibly and then he was in the third floor hospital, elevators did not work. So, he walked down through the stairs, both of his legs were shaking very bad while he was walking down three slides of stairs but he thought he came to the ground so he was able to walk on the flat floor on the street and able to walk home. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Outcome of the event tremor was unknown, while for the other events was unknown. The consumer considered a causal relationship between the events and the vaccine.

                                                upper bicep pain/soreness around upper part of bicep; tendonitis; lymphadenopathy; sore deltoid; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Healthcare Professional (patient).  This 58-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EI0142, expiry date Mar2021), intramuscular once to the left deltoid, on 28Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 58-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included an antihypertensive medication taking for several years. On 28Dec2020 the patient experienced side effects including sore deltoid (lasted for 2 days, Dec2020), and on 01Jan2021 the patient experienced upper bicep pain which he felt 5 days later (his friend said it may be lymphadenopathy).  The caller had the COVID vaccine on 28Dec2020, and from 28Dec2020 he had a sore deltoid for a couple days, but then almost a week later developed, he thought it was tendonitis, it was the upper part of his bicep, really he could not extend his arm all the way, it was so painful in that area, and it&#39;s still somewhat painful, but better. The sore deltoid was pretty much after the shot and into the next 48 hours, that went away, then he noticed this soreness around the upper part of his bicep, not until, probably, maybe 5 days later, on 01Jan2021. He was chatting with someone, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, that person felt it was lymph nodes, so maybe, there is possibility, caller thought this was muscle pain, as it hurts when he tried to extend his arm, it does not hurt when sitting here, but when he extends, especially over his head, it is really quite painful but it&#39;s lessened, he thought it was a tendonitis, but it could be the lymph nodes active or enlarged, he is not sure, he has never noticed lymph node pain, so he never knew what it was.  Causality for soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as yes. He is pretty sure, since he has not done anything that aggravated that muscle, he can&#39;t think of anything, and it is in the general vicinity of the injection. States he is on an antihypertensive medication, but has been taking it for several years. He doesn&#39;t want to go through a report for the person he spoke to, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, but it is interesting: the caller told him that had soreness, caller knows he also did report it, he reported it to Pfizer, actually he doesn&#39;t know if it was Pfizer or Moderna, but he reported it to whichever company, and said he thought was inflamed lymph nodes, so that was the first time he thought it was not muscle, but maybe the lymph node&#39;s reaction to vaccine, he has never experienced this kind of discomfort, he could not straighten his arm, as he would straighten the pain was at the upper insertion at the bicep, so that is where he came to this conclusion, his preliminary conclusions, he never thought it would persist this long. He thought, as time went by, it would be better tomorrow, and it has gotten better, but has not gone away.  Sore deltoid was reported as non-serious while soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as serious medically significant because it has persisted for so long, he would have not expected it to keep going on, but it is almost going on two weeks. Outcome of the event soreness around upper part of bicep, lymphadenopathy, and tendonitis was not recovered while the outcome of the sore deltoid was recovered in Dec2020.

                                                No initial symptoms other than sore arm at injection site which lasted for about 23 hours. On January 28 in the middle of the night woke up with pain in left hand. Could not move left hand. Was sleeping on back - not on arm or hand.  No restricted blood-flow.  Massaged hand and it became responsive.  This was followed by burning and tingling sensation in hand.  Hand was cold to touch first day. Burning and tingling and muscle tension increased for first couple days.  Would be intermittent and location varied. Hands and feet most common. Left back scapular area and left pectoral muscle common.  Muscle tightness would cause joint pain without signs of any redness. No temperature. No discoloration. Not as bad in middle of the day. After a few days. When second shot was administered on February 9 at 12:10 AM went home and all sensations stopped for about 12 hours. Took Tylenol with some benefit to diminish but not end symptoms. In past few days have read about taking antihistamines which has often helped.  Symptoms are not as intense as they started out to be, but they continue to linger.  Muscle tightness has largely given way to fluttering sensation or paresthesia and burning is mostly in bottom of left foot only. Any muscle tightness can be rubbed out (massage) for the most part. Occasional joint tightness continues in fingers - crack knuckles and it improves.

                                                Pt began feeling short of breath and feverish the night after receiving vaccine, which worsened to right-sided chest pain w/ inspiration that radiated to his back. Pt returned to work 03/01/2021 then checked into urgent care the following day d/t worsening symptoms. Patient Plan written by PAC: &#34;At this time the nature of your pain is not clear. Your cardiac enzymes are within normal limits except for myoglobin which often goes up with skeletal muscle pain. Your BNP test which can come up with congestive heart failure is elevated slightly from your normal.  We will want to recheck this in a week or so. Differential diagnoses could be skeletal muscle pain/injury, herpes zoster or shingles. (This can sometimes have sharp nerve type pain that will develop into a rash within the first 7 days.) Your rapid COVID test was negative.  We are sending a PCR test out just to confirm.  While awaiting test results please isolate at home. We will call you soon as results are back. Refer to Mendocino County&#39;s packet/isolation order. Your potassium level is low at 3.2.  It should be 3.6. We gave you some potassium to take in the clinic.  I am going to give you some to take for an additional few days. When you follow-up next week plan to have your labs redrawn.&#34; Plan Orders: SARS-CoV-2 RNA (COVID-19), QUALITATIVE NAAT to be performed. URIC ACID to be performed. The patient had the following medication order(s) completed today: Potassium Chloride 40meq PO; Toradol 15mg IVP.

                                                Within a minute of receiving vaccine I felt a very cold lump/ feeling in my throat that got worse over the next few minutes making it difficult to swallow.  At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

                                                First started feeling upset stomach and severe headache, then a couple hours later, the body aches and joint pain set in. He said his lower body felt like he&#39;d been in a car accident. He couldn&#39;t keep anything down to take pain medicine all day long so was miserable all day until about 4pm when he was able to drink some water and take some Vicodin, which did not help. He was up and down all night long with the headache and body aches, and I gave him Excedrin about 6am and that finally started alleviating the headache. He took it again at 11am and was able to eat then, and is gradually been feeling better throughout the day. He was finally able to take his regular meds so now the body aches have subsided (48 hours after injection/36 hours after onset of symptoms).

At bedtime 3-11-21, I had a fever 100.1. At 0100, fever rose to 101.1. At 0500 fever rose to 102.6. During day on 3-12-21, I felt like I had the flu, fever broke mid-morning. on 3-13-21, I felt OK. On 3-15 and 16, I felt like I generally like I  had a flue bug. I felt better days later and then around March 21-24th I&#39;ve had a pretty continuous headache and neck ache which I have not had before the  vaccine. Lack of energy and feeling crappy.

Back spasms may have been a result of the joint pains.  On a pain scale of 1-10 with 10 being severe, I&#39;d say it was a 4 although the back spasms were much higher.  Just wanted to document this.

                                                I had surgery for spinal stenosis on 07/09/2020, including a decompression and fusion at L4/L5.  I reported the following symptoms, which I attribute to the COVID-19 vaccination, to my spine surgeon.  I had my second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, March 29th at 5:45 PM.   Lower back pain in the general area of my surgery (07/09/2020) woke me up from sleep around 4:30 AM Tuesday (03/30/2021) morning.  Being woken up from sleep had never happened previously - not before surgery, following surgery, ever.  I recall the pain being a dull throbbing ache, nothing sharp.   I recall being generally pain free Tuesday during the day and went for a mile and half walk Tuesday evening and hit  about 20 40-yard (or less pitch shots) Tuesday evening.   I woke up Wednesday at my usual 6:45 AM.  Although I don&#39;t recall being in pain getting out of bed, I do remember being in excruciating pain the remainder of the day.  It hurt to walk (landing either foot) and the only position that I had any relief was sitting at work.  The pain was frequent, sharp, and up to a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.  I felt exhausted and feel asleep at 7:30 PM Wednesday night.   I was in significantly less pain Thursday, although it was still uncomfortable rising from a seated position and bending at the waist (to assume a putting position in the office) caused pain to the extent that I chose not to fully bend.  Thursday night was generally OK but there was one point, while seated on a couch, where I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the general area of my surgery.  I tried to change positions to alleviate the pain, but it persisted for 30 seconds before finally subsiding.  The pain felt like I was being stabbed and it was a 8 or 9 on a 1 to 10 scale.   Friday was a repeat of Thursday.  Generally, I have very little pain except when I stand from a seated position (1 or 2 on a 10 point scale) or bend slightly at the waist (3 or 4).  The pain is dull but the pain from bending does prevent me from bending comfortably.   All of this pain is new this week since Monday.  This past weekend I worked in the yard, including some heavy lifting and digging.   Is there any chance this is a side effect of the vaccine?  Should I schedule an office visit to evaluate the pain?  NOTE:  I was generally symptom free by Saturday, 04/03/2021 and totally symptom free by 04/05/2021.

                                                Have had increasingly significant pain in left shoulder. It is not at the injection site. It feels as though it is in the joint. I do not have a history of arthritis at the location. Has become increasingly worse to the point that I cannot lift the arm without severe pain in the shoulder joint area. Tylenol and ibuprofen do not seem to help.

On the 2nd day, I experienced fatigue, neck/muscle pain, and my wife encouraged me to take my temperature and I found I had a slight fever of 100.2F.  On the 3rd day (4/12), I felt only slightly fatigued with some neck pain but no fever at all.  Today (4/13), I have only neck/muscle stiffness (no soreness/pain) and no fatigue. I still have soreness at the injection site, but consider it mild. I don&#39;t have my 2nd dose scheduled yet, but anticipate it to be around May 6th.

It feels like all my nerve endings are on fire.  And when they are not on fire, they itch so bad, and I have scratched them so much, I have sores and scabs on my arms and legs from scratching a itch I can not reach.  Feels like the itching is under my skin.  Not on top.   1) Pain in ALL my body 2) High temperature - my house is 91 degrees and I&#39;m in a blanket and I&#34;m still cold 3) Even though I&#39;m cold - I sweat a lot 4) Have not been able to eat since I got the vaccine 8 days ago - growing very weak and loosing weight 5) I&#39;m dehydrated - Having trouble keeping liquids down 6) Bad stomach pains - sharp pains 7) Real bad gas and lots of it - Not normal for me 8) My kidneys hurt real bad - Probably clogged and overworked      I spend most of my time on the floor n my back.  Hurts too much to stand and walk   NOTE:  I&#39;m growing weak and very dehydrated.                   Something needs to be done soon !

I also notice that my armpit on left side was swelling up.   I figure it would be something that would go away by morning. Woke up on April 22 with a baseball sizes lump under my arm, pain and stiffness in my shoulder, neck and chest. I&#39;m greatly concern since i had  none of these symptoms prior to vaccine.   today is april 23rd and my lump has gotten bigger.

                                                The injection site was high on the deltoid; nearly to the apex of the shoulder. Within a few hours, I begin to experience some discomfort and a limited range of motion.  By the next morning, the right side of my neck was stiff. This may have been a result of me unable to sleep comfortably on my right side. I have also been having some slight headaches. Headaches are very rare for me, and these particular episodes do not tend to subside with over-the-counter relief. The oddest thing is my inability to focus visually. I wear corrective eye wear, but mostly for close work and reading. This Saturday, 4/24/2021, I had difficulty reading the subtitles on the television, with or without my glasses.

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 10Mar2021 at 16:30 (batch/lot number: EN6208) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (wanted the protection). Medical history included deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from Jul2018 and ongoing. No family medical history relevant to the adverse events. Concomitant medication included warfarin taken for maintenance level for history of DVT from Aug2020 and ongoing. The patient experienced DVT in right leg on 02Apr2021, swelling in right leg on 15Mar2021 and discomfort in right leg while walking on 15Mar2021. The patient reported that he had a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and he believes that it was directly related to the COVID-19 vaccine. He reported that he has a history of blood clots in his right leg going back to 2018. He reported that his most recent DVT was in Aug2020 and he was cleared in Nov2020. He reported that he received the COVID-19 vaccine on 10Mar2021. He reported that on 15Mar2021, he started to notice his right leg swelling. He reported that he called his physician on 29Mar2021 and that his physician ordered an ultrasound. He reported that he had the ultrasound on 02Apr2021 and a deep vein thrombosis was found again. Swelling in right leg: he reported that the swelling has gone down. He reported that the reason that he mentioned that he has a history of blood clots was because of his warfarin dosage. He reported that he was first diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis in Jul2018. He reported that he went through that cycle and that his maintenance level of warfarin was maybe 10 or 12 mg of warfarin per day. He reported that he had another deep vein thrombosis in Aug2020, and since Aug2020 he has been on 17 mg of warfarin daily. He reported that the blood level on warfarin maintenance was supposed to be between 2 and 2.5. He reported that now because of the deep vein thrombosis he experienced in Aug2020, his doctor wanted his level to be at 2.5 to 3.5. He stated that he doesn&#39;t think that at that blood level for his warfarin that he should have gotten a blood clot. He reported that something compromised or interfered with the warfarin, resulting in a deep vein thrombosis. Discomfort when walking: he reported that it feels like his leg was compressing. He reported that the discomfort seems to have gotten better. He was queried for details of warfarin prescription. He reported that the 10 or 12 mg warfarin tablets that he had been taking when the blood clot was diagnosed in Aug2020 have been consumed and he no longer has the bottle. He reported that he did not have the bottle with him for his current warfarin prescription. He reported that the warfarin was not auto-refilled by the pharmacy. He reported that the warfarin was only prescribed a week or two at a time. Investigations: he reported that since Aug2020 when the deep vein thrombosis returned, he started doing self INR tests at home. He reported that he constantly self-monitors his INR at home and his levels were consistently at 3.0 to 3.1. He reported that he monitors his INR at least once a week, sometimes twice a week depending on how he feels. He reported that sometimes his INR goes over 4 and he can feel it. He reported that his system was a little off when it feels too high so he knows how to adjust. He reported that he last checked his INR today, 15Apr2021, and that it was 4.0. He reported that he typically checks his INR on Wednesday. He reported that he keeps a log of his INR levels. He reported that he did not see his physician on 29Mar2021, but that he called his physician and his physician wrote a prescription for the caller to get an ultrasound. Vaccination facility type was pharmacy. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room and physician office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He reported that he doesn&#39;t usually get vaccines. BNT162B2 second dose (lot number: ER5729) was administered on an unspecified date; anatomical location: left arm. The outcome of the events was recovering.

And when I&#39;m trying to sleep, it&#39;s very uncomfortable and I haven&#39;t been able to get a full night&#39;s rest. I haven&#39;t seen any doctors or taken any medication because I thought that the symptoms would go away but they haven&#39;t. I don&#39;t know what to do

Working full shift.    Around 4 pm on Tuesday (after almost 3hrs OR case) - feeling very tired. Completed the working shift at 6 pm. Minor to moderate headache started to develop later in the evening. Two pills of Tylenol at 9 pm, another two around 2 am - while headache was getting worse.  @6:30 am Wednesday - informed managers that I&#39;ll have to stay off work because of bad headache (7 to 8 from 10), called EH as well.    During the day - mostly staying in the bed. Tylenol, water, tea with lemon, apples for hydration. Headache -- up and down (between 4 and 8), occasional fatigue and nausea (after staying upright more than 10-15 minutes), left upper arm pain, moderate pain in joints (knees, hips, low back). No fever.   Troubled night-time sleeping because of headache. 7 am - informed managers and EH about my condition, Got approval for another day off - with request to have a C-Test after that. Similar feeling and treatment.    Slow improvement during the day. Around 5 pm - feeling good enough to start moving more actively, headache and shoulder pain on low level, though getting tired quickly still.    Much better sleeping. No symptoms in the morning. Had a COVID test before returning to work.

At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down st.  On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January. At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down stairs as part of my daily activities.  The symptoms of shortness of breath only seemed to appear when I was on any form of extended walking activity or physical movements or exercise this would of have been starting around the 17th of January.  The right leg pain was masked by the heating rub while the shortness of breath continued for the next few days.  On the 19th of January,  I went to an Urgent Care Facility at 0800 am to see a Medical professional to discuss my symptoms I was previously experiencing and to figure out why I was having a shortness of breath and the pain in my right leg.  The on staff Physician&#39;s Assistant had a Nurse conduct a Covid 19 Rapids test (negative) and a second swab was administered and sent to the Lab.  Which produced a (negative for Covid 19) on the 20th of January.  An Xray was not taken to determine my shortness of breath.  The Dr listened to my lungs and heart,  though I did let the PA know I had received both Pfizer shots and when they were administered.  I was carrying My Shot record for the vaccine with the dates and lot number.   He didnt appear to be interested in further diagnosis and made sure I had the paperwork to track the results of my Covid swab sent to the lab. The visit was completed and I was released to go back to work/home.    I carried on the symptoms of the shortness of breath from the 19th of January to the 22nd of January monitoring my O2 (oxygen levels) with a pulse oximeter.  They ranged from 90-93.  On the evening of the 22nd of January I was becoming very uncomfortable with my breathing climbing the stairs in my home and monitored my O2 readings with the oximeter on my finger when walking upstairs and they dropped down to 60-65.  My wife drove me to the emergency room at Hospital.  I walked into the ER and checked myself in for shortness of breath and leg pain in my right leg.  I was admitted into the emergency room and put on 15 litres of oxygen.  The emergency room Dr ordered a chest Xray,  Cat Scan of my chest and heart and a sonogram of my right leg.  The testing results came back with a noted large pulmonary emboli on my lungs/heart area and blood clots throughout my right leg (right lower extremity DVT).    Surgery was performed to remove the pulmonary emboli and I was put on a Heprin Drip to thin out my blood for the remaining clots in my chest and my right leg. The attending physician ordered a T.E.E. (transesophageal Echocardiogram) to observe my heart functions.  I was told the TEE did not demonstrate any further recommend surgeries.  I was administered a test for my cardio and heart functions prior to my discharge on 27 January 2021.   I was prescribed Eloquis for maintenance medication to be monitored by followup visits to my cardiologist and Hemotologist within the next few weeks.  I have not family or personal history of Blood Clots.  I do perform administrative duties as part of my job, which requires sitting and working on a computer.  Note however I move around very often during a work day and operate a farm tractor and have an active life style.  I have not recently had any extended trips more than 2 hours nor have I flown within the past year or so.

A 59-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 15:00 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included hand arthralgias from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s known allergies indicated codeine. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other medication within two weeks and did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that after vaccination, almost three weeks ago, on 01Jan2021, the patient felt more arthralgias than usual. He developed arthralgias in his DIP joints of his left hand (vaccine was in left arm), pain was about 3-4/10. Mostly 3rd and 4th digit. No warmth or swelling that he can discern. It was odd to him because he has had hand arthralgias, but nothing that has persisted for more than a day or two. It seems to be a bit better now. Therapeutic measures which includes administration of Ibuprofen was done in response to the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

On Wednesday I got a very bad sore throat on the right side. I had intense headaches. The pain moved unilaterally to the right side of my head, ear, and neck. It was very painful. I went to see medical center on Thursday. I tested negative for Covid 19 and Strep. This pain persisted until today, March 28 (4 days)

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 06Mar2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pain, high cholesterol, and testosterone low, joint pain, bone pain, muscle pain, any place in his body had pain, and doesn&#39;t have good memory, all ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydrocodone for pain, ongoing atorvastatin for high cholesterol, ongoing clomiphene citrate for testosterone medication because it was low because of his age, ongoing colecalciferol (Vitamin D), ongoing ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), ongoing oxycodone for pain, and unspecified eye medication. He had many different medications that he was taking. Historical vaccines included chicken pox vaccine for immunization and shingles vaccine in Jan2020 for immunization and experienced pain all over. The patient stated that he was a torture survivor and he has been taking pain medication because of him being tortured previously. He was taking medications for the pain, clarified to be hydrocodone and oxycodone. These medications kept his body stable. He was able to sleep and relax. One day after he received his Pfizer COVID vaccine (07Mar2021), he started feeling the pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse but the pain used to be stable with the way he was using his medicines. But now his body was not stable. Any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously because of the damage of torture but now it all came up after the COVID vaccine. Every piece of his body hurt even if he takes his medications. He still had the pain and his body was so weak for about 4 to 5 hours. He used to be able to do his business all day but now after about 3 to 4 hours on his feet he got so tired and he needed to sit. He didn&#39;t know why this happened. He has talked to others that have received COVID vaccines and none have had this kind of reaction like him. He has asked them about it. It was very frustrating to him on an unspecified date. Every month he sees a physician. He would like for Pfizer to contact him with further questions, he can&#39;t understand the pain. This was really killing him especially when the pain goes to his bones. He will keep him up until 3 in the morning and he stays awake on an unspecified date. He then took medicine and he had to wait for 30 minutes for it to start working and then he will be able to sleep. But other than that, the pain jumped. He has had the chicken pox and the shingles vaccines and none did like that. The pain was not going away in his muscles or joints. And now he was getting a headache on an unspecified date, it was really frustrating. He didn&#39;t have good memory from the torture. This morning, when he woke up, he had the pain in his joints and his bones. He didn&#39;t like to use too much medication. He liked to use it only as he needs it. Pain medications are strong. But this COVID vaccine somehow made him need to use more medication and then that caused him to have a headache. His pain should get better with his medications but today, he had pain all over him and he didn&#39;t have any energy to move. He didn&#39;t know how to explain it. The COVID vaccine had really kind of made him weak. Sometimes he drinks a lot of cranberry juice to try and take the vaccine out of his system and it was frustrating because he hasn&#39;t ever been like this. When he had pain like this it reminded him of his torturing and what had happened to him. When the pain came on strong was when it reminded him of that. The medications he was taking were supposed to kill the pain. That was the reason he got so pissed and was trying to ask what was going on. This COVID vaccine is not safe he believed because it has been almost 10 days and it was not helping him. He was still not good. After he got his COVID vaccine on 06Mar2021, he had a little bit of small itching, not much, just a little bit that made him feel not comfortable with it. That was why they kept him for 20 minutes after his vaccine. When he got back home, he was okay, it was nothing serious. But then the day after his COVID vaccine on 07Mar2021, his joints, his muscles and his bones had pain. On 06Mar2021 the itching lasted about 20 minutes. He felt like he was chewing his lip, he was a little uncomfortable and he felt his ribs moving quicker. Nothing happened but he could feel it. He tried to chew his lips a couple of times, but not that much. But after that, he had pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine, 07Mar2021. By the time this vaccine started getting into his body, it was really hurting and getting worse. He had the shingles vaccine and for 1 1/2 to 2 days, he had pain all over and then 2 days after it was all gone, he was back to normal life. The pain was gone. With this COVID vaccine he thought that maybe it was going to be the same but it was not the same and it was hurting. The shingles vaccine was last year in 2020, 3 months before people knew about the coronavirus that was when he got the vaccine for shingles, so maybe Jan2020 was when he had the shingles vaccine. He had no medical conditions or heart and chest problems. No other vaccine he has taken has ever had this type of side effect to him. He took his shingles vaccine in his right arm and the COVID vaccine was in his left. With both he had the same start of having the bad pain. This COVID vaccine goes deeply to the body. The vaccines job is to wake the body. The vaccine&#39;s job is to wake up the body for the virus. The body has to make some kind of soldiers to stand up on the virus and this COVID vaccine had actually made his body weak. After the vaccine is supposed to wake the body, little by little the side effects are supposed to go away. His body was not learning this vaccine. It kept fighting to learn whatever was in this COVID vaccine, his body can&#39;t learn it and fight it. That was the reason his body got weak and the pain has not gone away. His body is still in alert and that&#39;s why the pain was still there. His body was still fighting. Somehow it didn&#39;t match the inside of the body. Maybe for some people that this will happen to, they will be okay but for some they will not be okay. It is not because some people have nothing wrong with them. The patient recovered from itching and discomfort on 06Mar2021; not recovered from any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously/ pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse/ pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine; while outcome of other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Second night after shot, I had a brief attack of severe chills, which woke me up, They went away after adding a blanket and dressing warmer.

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: ER8727, Expiration Date: Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 at 14:30 (at 59-year-old) at single dose in upper left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides. Concomitant medication(s) included hydrochlorothiazide/ lisinopril (LISINOPRIL/HCTZ) hypertension; citalopram; trazodone for sleep disorder; zolpidem for sleep disorder; simvastatin for blood cholesterol; alprazolam for anxiety (doctors said high dose which he needed to be stable, at least 7 years ago); and fenofibrate for blood triglycerides increased. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. E-transmitting possible duplicate AE as caller stated they already reported AE to previous agent. He had near all the side effects listed as well as severe allergic reactions listed. He hasn&#39;t been able to get out of the house since, felt like he had the flu. He has had the symptoms since; tiredness, headache, pain, terrible chills every day, joint pain, nausea, he was a hearty eater and he did not have a good appetite/ no appetite; he felt unwell, completely unwell, a sick feeling and it&#39;s pronounced; and particularly swollen lymph nodes, difficulty breathing at times, definite swelling of face and throat, dizziness and weakness. Caller provided these all started 2 weeks after he got the shot. Started on Saturday, 03Apr2021, and same thing happened everyday (going on). He called the weekend and after a couple weeks he called, the on call doctor and after his second call he was ordered to get to a medical facility/ urgent care facility (went to the doctor and it wasn&#39;t his regular doctor) in the weekend of 11Apr2021 and he has one nearby and they ran a test for COVID and it was negative, also tested for strep throat positive. He was given amoxycillin 30 tablets, 500mg tablets to be taken 3 times a day for 10 days for the strep throat, although he has not had any symptoms of strep throat which for him it is pronounced and painful, he can swallow, has no pain, no cough, nothing, he has nothing. His soreness and everything here was exactly what was in the manual was what he has going on and nothing else, no mucous, nothing like that. Confined to his house, has no energy to do anything chills and hot flashes. He has been taking ibuprofen 800mg tablets with food, 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening and got some relief from the chills and symptoms but not totally and it was waning in it&#39;s effectiveness after the first 3-4 days. All his symptoms were persisting and they had worsened after he started getting then for he guesses 4-5 days and then they kind of leveled as bad as they are now and haven&#39;t tailed off. He was ordered not to take the 2nd dose until he finishes all the amoxicillin and was told quite sternly not to get the 2nd dose until he finishes it. He has 12 pills left so next week sometime Tuesday or Wednesday and his concern was he finished that medicine and feels he would still have these side effects and doesn&#39;t know if he would build up immunity and maybe the 2nd shot won&#39;t be as bad. The nurse practitioner who worked with him at the urgent medical care place said the 2nd shot is a doozy and not to mix it with Amoxicillin as it might have a bad effect on the effectiveness of the strep throat. States he has had strep before and doesn&#39;t feel like that at all and nothing is wrong with his voice, throat or upper respiratory at all. He is supposed to get the 2nd shot tomorrow (16Apr2021), he was scheduled. He was afraid to do it as he hears it&#39;s worse than the 1st one and he is already relegated to his house and has to order in and not risk driving that&#39;s how foggy his brain was with what&#39;s going on his thinking is not straight from the pain. The outcomes of the events were unknown.

The technician decided to do a chest X-ray and fount pneumonia. She did a test and it came up positive. Somehow the virus aggravated the hips.  Tonight that pain is back in the right hip but not as severe.  It is different from the past bursitis.  It is like when I caught the virus.

A 59-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, at age of 59 years old, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 09:45 (Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure increased from 1995 and ongoing (It is controlled), anxiety (young and suffering from anxiety, has no clue why) and family cancer history. The patient previous received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 19Mar2021 09:45 (Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at age of 59 years old, at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He received the Covid vaccine on 09Apr2021. The following day he later noticed his elbow started bothering him that night, and around midnight it woke him up. He had intense pain in the elbow and tried to tough it out. 4 hours later he was in the ER, it was that bad. When he got there they did an ultrasound and some X-rays. The ultrasound showed his elbow was swollen, and they removed 17cc of fluid. They asked if he had any trauma to his arm and he said absolutely no way. He doesn&#39;t know what to think. He was trying to find someone to help with the issue. On a scale of 1 to 10 the pain was a strong 10. To this day it was still bothering him pretty bad. He coundn&#39;t work because of it. He could hardly straighten it out because it is so sore. It was painful, but not as bad as Saturday(10Apr2021) and Sunday(11Apr2021) morning. On 13Apr2021, his hand swelled up. That&#39;s gone away. His thumb hurt on 14Apr2021 and that had gone away, he just aced that. He put ice on his elbow. His elbow from last night(13Apr2021) to today (14Apr2021) probably had a 30 percent change. It is getting better but it is still sore. He can&#39;t straighten it and he is trying to bend it to work it so it doesn&#39;t get stiff. With the work he does he needs to use his arms. He works in construction. He got the shot on 09Apr2021, and the pain was later in the day. He received his dose around 0945, and at about 1500 to 1530 he noticed his elbow bothering him. Later that night when he went to bed he was uncomfortable and couldn&#39;t sleep. Eventually he did fall asleep and at 0000 he woke up in excruciating pain. He tried to deal with it until 0400 when he went to the ER. His pain is nowhere near what it was. When he tries to straighten it, it is very painful, about a 6. If he bends it back it is much better. If he tries to straighten it the pain level goes up. It is still swelled up a bit. It is hard to say if it has improved, he never really saw it. He went to bed and when he woke up he was in so much pain. He had on his PJs and put on his shoes and left. All he knew was he was in pain. He presumed it was more swollen then, they did the ultrasound and found all that fluid. The pain in his thumb subsided a bit. He took the ice off of it about 30 minutes before this phone call, so about 45 minutes ago. It feels a little better. At least one part of the puzzle is solved. He noticed it at about 0730 this morning. He had an ultrasound on 11Apr2021. He had 3 to 4 X-rays on 11Apr2021. Outcome for events was not recovered. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information expected

A 59-year-old adult make received the first dose of intramuscular BNT162b2 (solution for injection; Lot EL3248 expiry information not provided) as a single dose on 12Mar2021 (at 59-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient also started to receive subcutaneous adalimumab (HUMIRA, unspecified formulation) 40mg at an unspecified frequency from an unspecified date for arthritis. Relevant medical history included rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation, high blood pressure, red face, red skin, used cane for walking because he could not walk (before adalimumab), and a loss of hearing in the left ear (one month prior to starting adalimumab). It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. Concomitant medications included sulfasalazine for inflammation; lisinopril for high blood pressure; and another [unspecified] medication for inflammation. The patient previously received treatment for inflammation with steroids which were not good enough. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient developed arm pain, it made him tired, he had dizziness, fatigue almost every time, and a loss of balance. The patient had bumps from the injector pen/ Injection site papule, Pain in joint involving hand, bruising, sprain, and sickness. On an unspecified date in Apr2021 the patent experienced bilateral abnormal vision/vision decreased and blurring of eyes.  On 09Apr2021, patient received second dose BNT162b2 (solution for injection; Lot EL3302 expiry information not provided) as a single dose. The action taken with adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the event Sickness was recovered on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events bilateral abnormal vision/vision decreased, blurring of eyes, and fatigue, was not recovered. The outcome of the events pain in extremity / arm pain, bruising, sprain, dizziness, loss of balance, was recovering. The outcome of the events Pain in joint involving hand, Injection site papule, and bumps from the injector pen was unknown.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect product BNT162b2 was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of subject product,  BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded for the reported events of  Injection site papule, Pain in joint involving hand, bruising, dizziness, loss of balance, fatigue and sickness, based on temporal relationship.   Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that the subject product contributed to the RA flare and other reported events, which likely represent intercurrent medical conditions. There is very limited information provided in this report.   This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.
