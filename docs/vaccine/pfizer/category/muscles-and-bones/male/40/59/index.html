                                                Approximately 20 hours after I received the second vaccine dose, I developed a fever of 102 F. This was associated with other moderate-to-severe flu-like symptoms including chills, myalgias, and headache. Within 3 hours, the fever decreased to 99-100 F and remained between 98-99 F throughout the rest of the day. The headache and myalgias persisted, but by the following day (today), nearly all symptoms had resolved. No GI symptoms were experienced.

Later that night, about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine, I experienced mild wheezing for less than 5 minutes, but believe this was likely due to allergies and associated postnasal drip rather than the vaccine.  The following day I had mild muscle soreness and injection site pain without swelling or redness.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included clonazepam. The patient had historical vaccine first dose of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced tiredness. On unspecified date, the consumer stated, &#34;I just want to, I didn&#39;t have, I was just little tired with the first shot I received. But I am little concerning on the second one like I woke up at the middle of the night, I got it yesterday at about 13:00. I woke up at about 2:00 in the morning on 08Jan2021 nd I couldn&#39;t even really move but then I was up for most of the night. My temperature is like  between 102.6 and 103.5 and my back hurts really bad. So, I am hoping that these are normal things but I am curious at any point is there something I should watch out for taking on that stuff further. The first shot was not anywhere near to bad which I know is to be expected but the second one being the worse, it&#39;s like dramatic, I have had a fever for I don&#39;t know like eighteen hours. Is there anything I should just make sure, or like this can be a normal side effect, correct?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 40-year-old male patient started to receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 21Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), COVID-19 in 2020 (Jun2020 or Jul2020; tested positive for COVID-19 at that time and has 3 tests after that which were all negative) and since then lost weight (2020), and root canal. The patient had no issues with vaccines in the past. There were issues with the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, because he would be positive to TB, but this is because of his culture, he is from a specific country, and so they cannot take that vaccine. The patient clarified that he did not take the TB vaccine, what he meant was he is aware he can&#39;t take it. On 21Dec2020, the patient works in healthcare and had a patient that came in that tested positive for COVID-19 and so because of that, everyone including him that came in contact with the COVID-19 positive patient had to check and get tested. This happened the same day as his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the test (Dec2020) came out negative. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had not had any antibody test for COVID-19. The patient asked the doctor, but she never scheduled him for that, until after last month, she talked to him about it, but by that time he told her that he doesn&#39;t need it now - it&#39;s been almost a year.

No treatment was sought.

                                                The day after had myalgias and fatigue and arm pain.  But on 1/10/21 began developing mild 2/10 headaches.  On 1/11/21 the headache  worsened to 4/10 and was associated with myalgias and neck stiffness.  After a jog, I was in the shower and noticed a rash all over my body that had been pruritic.  I went to the ER that night where I tested negative for flu A/B and also tested negative for covid (Antigen then PCR).  Got a CMP, CBC, and coags to rule out ITP.  everything was normal.  The symptoms were so bad I stayed home from work on 1/12/21.  Over the next few days the rash improved and the headache slowly went away

I have had back pain before over the years from my job.  However, this pain was the worst its been and lasted more than 2 weeks.  I saw a chiropractor to help with the symptoms.  They have gotten much better, but are still there.   I also noticed that my right and left index finger were swollen and stiff in the knuckle closet to my hand.

Denies any fevers recorded at home. He feels like he has extra beats intermittently. Also reports some nausea, but denies vomiting or diarrhea. He has maintained good PO intake since symptoms started, but is worried he may be a bit dehydrated because he had a small AKI when he had covid back in March?.  Etiology of chest pains unclear, but given all of the above workup, unlikely to be due to an acute cardiac or pulmonary etiology.&#34;  He continued to have palpitations for the next week and had further EKG&#39;s don thru urgent care.

                                                Woke up in the morning with soreness in wrist and elbow and practically zero use of my left hand.  Woke up on left side so just assumed hand was asleep.  After 15 minutes of no improvement,  I started to panic thinking I was having a stroke.   Realizing I had no other symptoms and was feeling fine otherwise I knew that likely wasn&#39;t the case. Besides having zero strength (I did have feeling) my hand would curl inward toward my body.  I could manipulate with my right hand by it would always curl back in. I was barely able to grip, would actually have to manipulate my fingers into a grasp, couldn&#39;t do it on it&#39;s own, and holding something as light as my cellphone would cause my hand to turn down towards the floor. Pain level I would only describe as soreness in my wrist and elbow.  Annoying but not painful. It&#39;s now over 24 hours since symptoms first appeared and besides some slight weakness in the hand I would say I&#39;m 95% better.

Almost a week after I started getting sick, aches, shore throat, headache and fever (101.5F) that is when I went to the ED and it lasted about 2 days and then it went away. At the ED they did COVID and strep tests both negative. This was with my first dose and my second one the same thing happened.

                                                myositis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 43-year-old male patient received  first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown) on an unspecified date in Dec2020 reported as around the end of December,  at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date after he received the vaccine he had right arm pain and swelling (states it was in his bicep brachial radialis in the muscle) which is the opposite arm of the injection site. He had an MRI done on an unknown date that showed myositis. He thinks could be due to the vaccine since it started two days after he received the vaccine. His pain peaked at about a week and a half and now the pain was improving and the swelling was down. He still had function in the right arm but when he strained it would hurt. His concern was that the reaction may be an autoimmune reaction and the first response was muted. He was worried the second dose may elicit a larger response. At the time of the reporting the patient was recovering from the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between the myositis and vaccination with BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. Additional information regarding onset latency, relevant medical history, concomitant medications and detailed clinical course around the event onset will aid in comprehensive assessment of the case. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

After several hours of sleep I got out of bed around 0600 and noticed severe body and joint ache and a headache. Once I began moving around I also noticed I would fatigue very quickly. Reminded me of how one feels when they get a good case of the Flu. As the day progressed all symptoms lessened in severity and I went to bed at about 20% of what I felt that morning. I woke the following morning and felt no residual symptoms.

                                                massive heart attack; knee pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 43-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Mar2021 12:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart attack in 2019, heart disorder (Heart),  Blood cholesterol abnormal (cholesterol), hurt his knee at work prior and torn meniscus. Concomitant medications included ongoing ticagrelor (BRILINTA) for the heart; ongoing atorvastatin for cholesterol and ongoing carvedilol (COREG) for the heart. The patient previously took clopidogrel (PLAVIX) for heart attack. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No adverse events following prior vaccinations. The patient called about the COVID 19 vaccine. He received his first COVID-19 vaccine on 12Mar2021 and suffered a massive heart attack on the same day. After the event, his cardiologist reviewed video from the heart catherization to open the blockage and the cardiologist indicated that the area that was obstructed with this heart attack had not been obstructed 2 months ago. The cardiologist believed that the COVID 19 vaccine is the culprit in causing the massive heart attack. The cardiologist believed the area of the blockage was too dramatic. The cardiologist encouraged the caller to report the event and the cardiologist will offer his expertise in this matter if needed. The patient also tried to report to his local health department but is waiting on a call back from them. He reported that he had a heart attack in 2019. He was taking Plavix but after this heart attack his cardiologist has changed some of his medications. He reported he believes his medications were changed at his follow up visit with the cardiologist on 23Mar2021. He reported that he had continuous blood work done while in the hospital. They were monitoring his troponin levels. He also had a chest X-Ray, EKG and after the heart attack he had an echocardiogram to monitor the extent of the damage caused by the heart attack. He clarified that he did go to the emergency department on 12Mar2021, the same day he received the Covid 19 vaccine, but for knee pain. He received a pain relief injection of fentanyl that day. He had hurt his knee at work prior. He had previously had an MRI of his knee that showed a torn meniscus. He does not believe his knee pain on 12Mar2021 is related to the Covid 19 vaccine as he had already had an MRI that showed a torn meniscus. He had gone to the emergency department for pain management of his knee. He thought he would be given a lower strength pain medication but received Fentanyl. While the patient was at the emergency room for his knee, he suffered a massive heart attack. The patient clarified that he went to the emergency department because of pre-existing knee pain and while at the emergency department caller suffered a massive heart attack. The patient was hospitalized for massive heart attack from 12Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The outcome of the event heart attack was recovering while the outcome of the event knee pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal association between BNT162B2 and the massive heart attack cannot be completely excluded. The knee pain was assessed as an intercurrent condition and is unrelated to BNT162B2.

                                                Little muscle twitches; felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines; Low grade fever; Muscle soreness; Muscle tiredness; Hands were a little shaky; Very diaphoretic; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other Nurse. This 44-year-old Nurse (Patient) reported that he received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown) at single dose for vaccination in Jan2021 around 9:45am. Relevant medical history included ongoing Mild shrimp allergy  and ongoing Hypertension. Relevant concomitant drugs included amlodipine at 10 mg once daily for Hypertension since Feb2020 and ongoing. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None.  Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was None. The patient was administered the COVID Vaccine around 9:45am; about 10 minutes later he had onset of little muscle twitches on the left side of his body that started in the calf then the glute, then the quadricep, then the bicep and then just started bouncing around everywhere on left side. Approximately a half an hour after that those little muscle twitches started on the right side of his body. Now the little muscle twitches are just everywhere; his hand, his heel, right now as he is speaking he is having the little muscle twitches in his heel; This event has been ongoing since onset; but changed today around 5:00am when he felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines which is probably impossible, but it feels like it is not just muscular now, like it is happening in his intestines which concerns him. The little muscle twitches do not hurt, he thinks that is probably why he has waited a week to call; but the fact that they are ongoing and changed today, worsened is unsettling. He reported since that first dose of COVID Vaccine was administered he has also had low grade fever; muscle soreness; muscle tiredness. He reported that a rapid response team was called immediately because of the initial reaction he had. Later that day his hands were a little shaky, he got very diaphoretic and the nurses on the unit of the hospital said he almost fell which he does not recall at all; in response to those events he was taken to the emergency department where they did a complete workup including labs: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), checked his heart and everything was fine; no notable results from any of those tests. The patient was not admitted to the hospital; under observation in emergency room only. Outcome of events Little muscle twitches, Low grade fever, Muscle soreness and Muscle soreness was not resolved, outcome of other events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

He is currently a highway patrol officer. While driving in his patrol car, at 1035, he felt tightness in the back of his neck and tightness to his airway- he described it feeling like someone hit him in the neck. He denied having any trouble breathing. Later, he noted his hand was twitching. 1045, he came back to lobby and made an RN aware who brought him to employee health. He declined to go to ED (I found out later).  BP was 153/115 HR 102  initially, no hx of high bp.  No noted hives or swelling to face or mouth/tongue or L deltoid region.  Pt. denied feeling any itching anywhere.  Pt. rested for about 15 minutes on exam table. Re-check of BP was 151/113 HR 84.  Pt. states he feels better and feel like that feeling of tightness in his neck is decreasing.   Made aware to follow up with PCP regarding BP and giving informational handout regarding blood pressure.  RN recommended he go to any ED if he has any trouble breathing, swelling of tongue, etc at any time after he leaves this hospital. Pt. verbalized understanding.

The pain became worse over the next several days resulting in what I&#39;d describe as an electrical shock/burning feeling whenever I moved my left arm the wrong way (seemingly pinching the lymph nodes). I&#39;m currently on day 5 of the pain and it&#39;s still present although it has lessened on the 5th day. On the 2nd day the pain started to move down from the armpit closer to the pectoral.

By 1600 I had extreme fatigue and severe mental fogginess.  This fogginess lasted approximately 24 hours.  Other reactions included chills, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, headache as expected.  I feel the mental effects could put patients in danger if healthcare practitioners are not aware of the possibility of this and receive the vaccine while on duty.  I did not experience this with the first dose.

                                                Received  second dose of  Pfizer COVID vaccination on January 9, 2021. At the time of the vaccination he experienced discomfort of  left deltoid (site of injection) as well as paresthesia at the injection site. He also experienced systemic symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias for 24 to 36 hours. Over the course of the next several days he experienced continued significant numbness and weakness in left upper extremity, specifically in left deltoid muscle. By Sunday 1/17/2021 the significant left deltoid weakness and numbness persisted, specifically not being able to lift his arm greater than 45 degrees using his deltoid. He contacted health on 1/17/2021. On 1/19/2021 he had a consultation with a physician. Based upon his clinical examination, and symptom complex, physician does not believe that this is a cervical spine issue but rather a local nerve injury related to the injection site. He was prescribed a steroid taper. Unclear whether this is temporary or permanent issue.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN). Thursday evening (14Jan2021), the patient had slight 1-2/10 substernal chest pain on/off. Friday evening around 23:30 (15Jan2021), the patient had chest pain substernal 7-8/10 that lasted for one hour. The burning sensation was worse with cold air. It resolved with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Monday early morning at 04:00 (18Jan2021), the patient experienced STEMI COVID vaccine induced wherein the patient woke up with 10/10 chest pain and shoulder pain which lasted for 30 to 40 minutes and resolved with paracetamol and ibuprofen. The patient also decided to check blood work Monday morning (18Jan2021) while in the hospital. Trop came back 16.28 ng/ml. This is the old trop not high sensitivity. Normal high is 0.30 ng/ml. The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2.

                                                On January 3, I developed severe pain behind my right scapula.  The pain lasted about a week.  I subsequently developed right triceps and wrist/finger weakness.  I sought care from my orthopedist, physical therapist, and eventually was referred to neurology.  Yesterday I received a diagnosis of Parsonage Turner syndrome which may have been caused by the vaccine.

ED drew blood cultures and then started vancomycin.  Vitals normal and stable in ED.  Admitted to hospital.  Provider notes on 2nd day of admission as follows.  Cellulitis and abscess of the right medial thigh likely secondary to a skin tag tear which introduced infection.

But the second dose of this vaccine (on 2/7/2021) was different. In addition to the severe pain on my left arm, I had (and still) a severe headache, pains all over my body and bones, high fever (102), dizziness, shaking, fatigue, cold at all times, and a little bit taste loss (as of right now, 24 hours after the vaccine). It looks like a hard flu symptoms exactly.

Narrative:  12/21 employee received vaccine at 0930 - later in the afternoon he noted tachycardia to about 100. He was watching the rate on his Apple watch. The highest rate was 130. His only other symptom was fatigue which was bad enough on 12/22 that he had to go home. He saw his PCP on 12/22 for the tachycardia who ordered labs which were all normal. He is a resident so he asked anesthesia to do an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia. On 12/23 his heart rate average went down to 100. Today (12-28) his resting heart rate is 70-80 which is his baseline. He has not had recurrence of the tachycardia since 12/23. He also reports he had soreness at the injection site and myalgias both of which have since resolved.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

The day after vaccination,  patient was complaining of fatigue with subjective fevers and rigors with associated headache and neck stiffness and on the day of presentation he complained of increased fatigue and general malaise for which he left work early and was ultimately found poorly responsive in his private vehicle with concern for possible seizure activity.  He was brought to ER by ambulance.  He reported numbness in hands and legs, rigidity, and an episode of urinary incontinence.  He was started on empiric antibiotics for possible CNS infection, lumbar puncture completed. Found to have acellular CSF and antibiotics were discontinued.  Patient remains in hospital at this time with course complicated by post-LP headache.

                                                After the administration, I was monitored for 15 minutes and I was fine. I left the hospital, start driving, and suddenly felt that my right arm was heavy, numb, with a tingling sensation. I stopped the car and called the nurse and I was told that it will go away, and I can take a tylenol/motrin. It improved over the next hour and I felt it resolved a few days later but then it returned on 1/18 but not to the same extent, and I also felt intermittent tingling and numbing in my right foot. I also experienced intermittent episodes of fast heartbeats and missing heartbeats since the vaccine almost daily. I was fatigued and extremely thirsty for 3 days but that resolved completely.

                                                I received the first dose of Pfizer EK5730 at 18:07 on 12-30-2020.  For the first day my arm was a bit sore but nothing to bad.  The next few days 48-72 hours later I started to have many more  symptoms, some minor to sever including joint pain, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.  lesser included some nauseas.   The joint pain was so bad at one point i had to pull over while driving.  on 1-2-21.  as of writing this now 14 days out I still have some joint pain especially in my arms.  No other symptoms of note.   I would add that I tested positive for COVID -19 on 10-18-2020 and was not released from quarantine until 11-5-20  I did seek treatment during this time through by calling my Dr. did not require any hospitalization.

                                                Some background: I normally react badly to flu/respiratory vaccines in that I generally get sicker after the vaccine than I do when I get the virus.  So this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn&#39;t too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel &#34;down for the count.&#34;  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).  This morning is the week &#34;anniversary&#34; of the shot.

Few days after that I developed numbness and weakness on my left side and pins and needles in my Left index finger. I saw my primary care doctor twice that week. He started me on low dose Prednisone and gabapentin for the pain while sleeping. When the nerve pain/numbness did not subside, I asked for a neurology referral. Two doctors saw me for brachial plexus neuritis. I have had 2 ultrasound guided and one fluoro guided cortisone shots along the nerve. I have also been going to PT 2-3 x/week to regain my strength on the Left side &amp; calm nerve.

                                                Approximately 24 hours post shot I experienced severe joint pain in most all joints.  Shortly after onset of joint pain experienced severe chills.  Those symptoms persisted for approximately 12 hours after which I continued to experience injection site pain, but began to experience pain with some numbness that radiated from the injection site distally down my arm and into my pinky and ring fingers on my left hand.  No other symptoms.  As of today the injection site pain persists as does the pain and numbness in my pinky and ring fingers, but I get the feeling that it is getting slightly worse.  The pain and slight numbness is present when I awake, but gets worse throughout the day.  Some evenings there is considerable discomfort.

Wednesday afternoon around 2pm, I went to my dentist thinking it was due to my Invisalign which I started on Jan 25, 2021.  The dentist told me it is most likely Bell&#39;s palsy so I decided to go to Emergency.

                                                Early Wednesday morning (2/24) around 5:00AM, I woke up to extreme pain in my left arm, primarily along the upper forearm, inside of my elbow, and lower bicep. There was no trauma or unusual behavior prior to onset of pain. It came on suddenly and worsened with extension of the arm. Symptoms worsened over the next few days, with pain intensifying and extending down into my hand and up into my armpit and shoulder. I tried ice, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, and Vicodin for pain relief, but nothing really helped other than the ice. On Saturday morning (2/27), I visited Urgent Care and was diagnosed as brachial plexis neuritis, aka Parsonage-Turner Syndrome by Dr and prescribed Prednisone and rest. On Sunday evening (2/28), I went to the ER seeking pain relief and second opinion. On Monday (3/1) morning, I was seen by ED doctors, and then three different neurologists. After doing an ultrasound which ruled out vein/artery thrombosis, the neuro team diagnosed Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. They&#39;ve prescribed Gabapentin, Acetaminophen, and Ibuprofen for pain relief,  a follow-up neuro consult, an MRI for next Friday, and an EMG in a few weeks. Last night while sitting and reading, the same pain began in my right arm, similarly to how it presented in my left arm last week. The right arm pain is less than the left arm pain, but at this point seven days later, I am experiencing neuropathic pain in both arms.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

About 25 minutes after the injection, I was concerned (possibly too anxious) and I decided to return to the site. I crossed the bridge and sat down at the bridge gate. The personnel there called an EMT, and about 15 minutes later the EMT came to talk to me and take my blood pressure and pulse Oxygen. Blood pressure was 137 - 87. Pulse Ox was 100%. By that time I had calmed down the sensation in my legs had eased. Approximately 2 hours after the injection I began to feel soreness in my joints (and this did not pre-occupy me, since I knew that feeling the beginning of aches and pains a couple hours after injection is normal). It is now 6 hours and 32 minutes after the injection, and I am feeling ok. It was quite probably anxiety on my end. The folks in city were very nice to me at the pedestrian bridge gate. I have noted talking the EMT below as health professional visit, I also plan to go see Dr. prior to the 2nd shot.

My heart rate at that time was 85-90/min and BP was 140/90. Pulse OX was normal. The dizziness improved gradually and lasted for approximately 4 hours. I did not take any medication. Next day, on 1/5/2021 I still felt a little dizzy and I had muscular pain on my L arm. The symptoms completely disappeared on 1/6/2021.

The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

Both IM through my left arm. Directly for about less 48H post vaccination I had muscle pain that were self-resolved.  On Jan 18, 2021, I started having funny sensation (like having a foreign body) over my left eye medial /innercantus area. The next 2 days I started to have pain over my left external ear canal, then it progressed into pain over my left lower jaw, left vertex of my head, inner side of left eye. My SS progressed on 1/30/21 at around 3:30 PM to numbness over my left sided tongue and left sided lip. Then on 1/31/21 at around 5 AM, I started having left facial paralysis. I have left BELL&#39;s PALSY which was confirmed. following a negative non-contrast brain MRI to rule out stroke and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR test. I start taking Prednisone 60 mg daily and Acyclovir 1 g TID on Jan 31, 2021. To this date I still have left facial paralysis but not worsening.

                                                Shortly after receiving the injection my arm went ice cold all the way to my fingers and warmed up again quickly. On the way home (about an hour later) I noticed numbness and tingling in my hand and that has continued since (11 days as of this report). My upper arm muscle was sore later that evening and by the next day the pain in my upper arm was extreme. I couldn&#39;t move my arm without extreme pain. I took some tylenol late in the day and that did help cut down on some of the pain. I also put an ice pack on my upper arm but it didn&#39;t help. The pain wasn&#39;t as bad the next (3rd) day but it&#39;s still significant enough for me to restrict activity with it. There is also a burning sensation off and on as well as itching deep in my arm. My upper arm has also felt like there is a tight band around it (since day 2) although the muscles themselves don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s any tightness or knots. I took ibuprofen on day 10 and it helped a little but not a whole lot. At this point I also have what feels like swelling or tenderness under my arm near the armpit area. The pain, burning and itching in my upper arm continues as well as the numbness, tingling and pins all up and down my arm to my hand and fingers.

It was like that for the whole day. He also felt really weak. He was unable to keep his upper body up. He struggled all day while at work. He thought he had Covid but was tested and the result was negative. The pain became worse and moved from his spinal cord to his head. This caused him to miss work. He did not have any energy and was unable to get out of bed. He also lost his appetite. Then on 15Jan2021 his energy level was through the roof like he was on steroids&#34; The action taken was not applicable.

A 53-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), solution for injection, lot number: EK5730, intramuscular in the left shoulder on 23Dec2020 12:00 at a single dose for covid-19 prophylaxis. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient&#39;s historical vaccine included Shingrix and experienced weak, tired and achy that lasted for 24 hours, he received this 6 months ago (2020). The patient experienced achy joints and fatigue, both on 24Dec2020 at 10:00 with outcome of recovering. The patient called about the Covid-19 vaccine and reported that he received it last Wednesday on 23Dec2020. He said that since then he has had achy joints and fatigue that started on Thursday 24Dec2020 that has been going on through today. He received the vaccine at the hospital where he works at. His symptoms are persisting, but stated that he does feel a little bit better today. He said that it does not seem to be getting worse. He read achy joints and tiredness were some of the reactions to be expected with the medication, and now he was thinking it was a little more long term than what it should be.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

                                                Blood clots in right leg below knee; he passed out from pain; pain in his right knee; he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all; knee was swollen; couldn&#39;t walk/limping around; his knee more stiff; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 53-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 21Mar2021 at 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing Factor V Leiden heterozygous, allergies to mushrooms from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and a torn meniscus in his right knee and he had surgery 3 to 4 years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Cephalexin and Percocet and experienced allergies. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested post vaccination. On 22Mar2021 at night around 2:30AM, the patient woke up and started walking to the bathroom and he passed out from pain. He had pain in his right knee. He thought he had torn his knee again. He had surgery 3 or 4 years ago for a torn meniscus in his right knee and he thought he had torn his meniscus again. He passed out, his wife found him and he went back to bed. In the morning, his knee was still very very sore, he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all. He took an Advil between 6:30AM and 8:00AM. He hadn&#39;t taken any medications prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. His knee was swollen but the pain was manageable. He couldn&#39;t walk, he was on crutches for about 24 hours then the swelling started coming down and he put a brace on his knee. He could then walk without the crutches but it was still painful. The next day he had pain in the back of his knee. He thought the pain was caused because he had put the brace on and had been using the crutches. Like he had made his knee more stiff from not using it. He was limping around and the pain was bearable. At that point, the pain was maybe a 4 on a scale of 1-10 where his pain had been a 9 on a scale of 1-10. He took another Advil and he realized the pain in the back of his knee wasn&#39;t going away. He went to see his family doctor and his doctor was able to get him in that same day for an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed 2 blood clots behind his right knee. The patient had blood clots in right leg below knee. The week of the report, he got an appointment with a hematologist. The hematologist reviewed his case and the doctor isn&#39;t 100% sure the blood clots were from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine but the doctor isn&#39;t ruling it out either because it happened within 24 hours of receiving his first COVID-19 dose. He hadn&#39;t done anything strenuous before getting the COVID-19 vaccine, nothing that he thinks would have caused the blood clots. He would like to add, what he thinks is relevant, is that he is positive for Factor V. He reports he has one copy and Factor V only impacts about 3% of the population. The hematologist thought that he might be prone to developing blood clots. The hematologist reports that he has had patients who have had the COVID-19 virus who have developed blood clots. Maybe it&#39;s possible that the COVID-19 antibodies were trying to build up his immune system to COVID-19 and it created something similar to having the COVID-19 virus. If he is predisposed to blood clots then the COVID-19 vaccine may have precipitated the blood clots. His second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for Sunday, 11Apr2021. He had talked to both his family doctor and his hematologist and they both thought he should be ok in getting the second COVID-19 vaccine. He was prescribed blood thinners. If the second COVID-19 vaccine caused more blood clots the blood thinners would help him. He was asking if there is any additional information or guidance on receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine after his reaction. The pharmacist told him that the COVID-19 vaccine trials were all done in the left arm. He received his vaccine in his right arm and his right knee was affected. If he gets the second COVID-19 vaccine he&#39;s getting it in his left arm. He was prescribed Eliquis 5mg take one tablet twice daily. The outcome of the event blood clots in right leg below knee was recovering while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                Within approximately a couple of days from the first of two COVID19 Pfizer injections, I developed a progressive, systemic, neuro/neuro-muscular inflammatory pain response.  The inflammation and pain first manifested in my left wrist and hand, greatly worsening recent symptomology that may have been the start of a carpal tunnel syndrome.  The inflammation and pain then progressed to my right wrist and hand and right shoulder.  Then they progressed to my left shoulder, under my clavicles, my hips,  and my upper lumbar/lower thoracic region of my spine.  Muscle groups tightened and hurt, chief among them my hamstrings and upper back.  All within days.  The inflammation and pain were severe, especially from the early a.m. (3 or 4 in the a.m.) to waking hours.  And the conditions left me nearly debilitated and incapable of sleeping well or performing many ADLs.  Then, on Monday, March 29, 2021, I saw an orthopaedic for the pains in my wrists and hands, and he prescribed me a steroid for a preliminary diagnose of bilateral carpal tunnel.  The inflammation and pain throughout my body decreased considerably after only two doses of the steroids.  That led me to seek a consultation with the rheumatologist.

About 1/1 had ill feeling, very tired, soreness in joints, extreme pain in arm/ legs. did not have breathing problem.  pain and limited range motion lasted until 1/7/21. I called health clinic and they told me to call cdc number on vaccination card.  That number sent me to reporting center, no help.  Called family physician, they said they knew nothing about vaccine.  Since i wasn?t having breathing problem i just dealt with pain and took Tylenlol couple times each day.  Took second dose vaccine 1/20/21.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

I took ibuprofin and acetaminiphin alternating every 4-6 hours for the aches - this dulled the pain but did not eliminate it.  Pain went from level 6 to level 4.

The first dose of the vaccine, the pain started the second day and the injection site got swollen. But this second dose was within 2 hours of my vaccine even more and overwhelming fatigue.  - aches, chills, muscle cramps, coughing, sweating - those lasted three days; headache - ever present and felt like head was in a vice; breathing was an issue - asthma was triggered on Sunday  - I started prednisone  - informal dr consultation with a friend - on Tuesday because of the asthma and by Friday I was feeling halfway better again and by the following Sunday about 75% better. 9 days later I was back at work. It took that week back at work though to get back out of the funk and by the following weekend I was close to 90%. Pain in the shoulder lasted about two weeks - it was quite tender for that long.

A 55-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6204), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Mar2021 09:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing high blood pressure (began years ago about 10 years ago, states he has no names or lot numbers of the blood pressure pill). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced chills and shaking. He stated he was probably running a fever but he don&#39;t know. On 26Mar2021, he woke up with extreme lower extremity weakness, stating his legs didn&#39;t want to work. He had to use a ladder to pull himself up out of the chair. He checked his temperature and it was either 101 degree F or 100.1 degree F. He was running a fever now of 100.1. Patient stated he had the 1st dose on 23Mar2021 and it was about three days ago and then yesterday (26Mar2021) he liked to froze to death in his house which was 80 degrees and he was covered up and had covers on him. He got ready for work today and when he got up his legs did not want to work and it would have been very easy to fall and when he came in, he fell in the door but his legs were so sore and he was running a fever now of 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit on 26Mar2021. Patient had the Pfizer COVID shot in his left arm and had no soreness or anything like that but stated he was in the hospital for three days trying to get his potassium up on an unspecified date and went through sixteen little bags of concentrated potassium and the first potassium bag was on a drip machine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A contactable nurse and contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ XR), orally from 02Oct2020 at 11 mg, daily for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 19Dec2020, the patient experienced neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare.  In Dec2020, the patient experienced increase in joint pain from his baseline. The physician was aware. The patient was placed on unspecified steroids for the events, neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare which minimized symptoms. While weaning off steroids, the severity of symptoms returned. The patient was instructed by the doctor to stop taking tofacitinib citrate which was stopped on 29Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable and for tofacitinib citrate was permanently withdrawn on 29Dec2020.  The patient reported slight improvement after stopping tofacitinib citrate.  The outcome of neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare was recovering and of increase in joint pain from his baseline was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, the reported events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors and unlikely that it is related to the suspect product. However due to temporal association with the vaccine, a possible contributory role of vaccine cannot be ruled out. Case will be reevaluated based on additional information during the follow-up.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

                                                I was symptom free when I went to bed four hours after vaccination.  In the middle of that first night (03/02/21), I awoke with an overall body ache, which persisted through the next day.  In the morning of the next day (03/03/21), I awoke with soreness at the vaccination site, tightness in my chest, and a swollen, red left ankle.  The overall achiness and sore arm were understandable, but the chest tightness made we wonder if inflammation in the region persisted from my cardiac ablation in May 2020 and was aggravated by the covid vaccine.  I have a Kardia home-test ECG monitor, and the results of the test continue to be &#34;normal.&#34;  As far as the ankle, an MRI in August 2020 determined that I had torn my peroneal brevis tendon.  After six weeks in a walking boot, I began physical therapy and noticed that if I exerted myself too much that I would get swelling and soreness.  Everything in my ankle was healed by October 2020, and I have been hiking / running four times a week since without incident.  I did not injure myself before the vaccination, so it seems to much of a coincidence that inflammation returned to my previously injured ankle just hours after receiving the covid vaccine.

I exp fatigue and couldn&#39;t sleep  I went to ER HR 180/10, elevated HR/BP, muscle joint pain and tremendous back pain. After I followed up with my PCP still elevated BP 140/70  as a result I&#39;m on blood pressure medication. I was advised to stay on this new medicine until I receive the second dose of the vaccine. Also was told to take Benadryl and Tylenol before taking 2nd Covid vaccine.

                                                I developed severe back pain from an old injury. The back pain was far more painful this time and I had a 25 minute long shivering attack (rigors?). I was admitted to Piedmont for observation (I had an intermittent fever) and tested for everything. All results; MRI, CT, Echocardiogram, showed normal for my age. The pain is better and improving but it?s still been significantly longer lasting than any previous time. My PCP suggested I post this info to the CDC website but I wanted to let you know in case you were compiling any info related to symptoms/side effects.

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

This is the second of two reports. The reporter describes events following both vaccinations in a vaccine series. This report is for those events which occurred following the second vaccination.      A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3249), intramuscularly on 01Feb2021  (at the age of 57-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia from an unknown date. The patient&#39;s historical vaccinations included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 after which he experienced inflammation, joint pain and burning sensation in the joints. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The vaccination was administered at a hospital. Concomitant medications included acetaminophen (TYLENOL), tamulosin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) all from unspecified dates and for unknown indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Per the reporting physician, he got his first vaccine on 22Dec2020.  His MCP and PIP joints and SI joints started burning close to 3rd week in Jan2021. He had some minor SI pains intermittently before but none with hands. Continued hurting enough that he started taking Osteobiflex and fish oil and more tylenol for inflammation. After second vaccine on 01Feb2021 the symptoms he experienced after the first dose have been getting worse.  He mentioned that his hands burn all the time, at times like tonight bad enough that they keep him awake.  He has red nodular areas on some of his knuckles and a distinct nodule at the proximal ulnar aspect of my left 4th finger PIP that is uniformly erythematous. Not all knuckles have the same degree of burning, but all including thumbs have it. The SI joint pain is more variable and at time does not bother him, but the hands get swollen and tight to close everyday. He plans to start some prednisone tomorrow due to the progression of the burning. The clinical outcomes of the events burning sensation in joints worsened, swelling of hands, stiffness joints, inflammation, condition worsended, erythema, nodule on extremity were reported as not recovered. The outcomes of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administration and off label use were unknown.  It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021154881 Same patient, same drug, different AE, different dose of vaccine.

A 57-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Mar2021 at 15:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gout, neuropathy, high cholesterol and heart disease with 4 heart &#39;stints&#39; and known allergies to dairy. Concomitant medications included colchicine (COLCHICINE), gabapentin (GABAPENTIN), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPRIN). The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took and had allergies with Cipro [ciprofloxacin] and Erythromycin. It was reported that 20 hours plus after the shot, on 06Mar2021 at 13:15, the patient experienced the most severe neuropathy attack of his life - both feet were on fire when with proper medication, he has been under control for years. The patient also reported joint pain, lower back pain, bowel and stomach issues and chills on 06Mar2021 at 21:15. The patient had no COVID prior to the vaccination and had not tested post vaccination. No treatment administered for the events. The events had not resolved.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 57-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 57-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today. The reported adverse events resulted to an emergency room and physician office visit (went to the orthopedist). The patient received corrective treatment as response to the reported events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                He collapsed with left sided hemiparesis; Stroke; Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect.; Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect.; Low platelets, 114; His bp as high as 200s/100; Hand weakness; Myalgia; Fever; Severe fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), intramuscularly on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Concomitant medication included hypertension medications in two weeks. The patient was presumed neg covid status prior to vaccine. He worked as a Pulm/critical care physician. He reported fever, myalgia, fatigue on 16Dec2020. Next day (17Dec2020), he took off from work due to his symptoms. The following day (18Dec2020), he came to work. He c/o ongoing severe fatigue &amp; hand weakness in am. Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care. Full course was unknown but had rebleed there with low plts. Adverse event (he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis) resulted in hospitalization (22 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability/incapacitating or permanent damage. Treatment was received for adverse events. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient: on 18Dec2020, Nasal Swab test: negative. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, on 22Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID 19 immunization. Relevant medical history included COVID infection last Apr2020. On the peak of the COVID pandemic he had the COVID infection, he lost the sense of taste and smell, had diarrhea although he did not have fever and did not have coughing. He also has medical history of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome. He was tested for COVID, he was positive 2 times and then they did PET scan, MRI from head to toe. They were looking for tumor, neuroblastoma, what was causing the shaking, the myoclonus, the opsoclonus, the ataxia, they could not find anything. They gave him convalescent plasma and then they gave him immunoglobulin human normal (IVIG) 5 doses and they gave him high dose of steroid to the point that his blood sugar was reaching sky high they have to give him insulin. He was hospitalized 2 times, 3rd time was 2 days and sent home and then it got worst, so he was readmitted for another &#39;3&#39; days. So, he was sent home on clonazepam, it makes him drowsy and he went for physical therapy and slowly after almost after 8 weeks his symptoms disappear, and he was able to go back to work. His symptoms all recovered by the end of May, towards the beginning of Jun2020 he went back for the swab test, it was negative, COVID PCR negative and my antibody was positive. Concomitant medications included clonazepam, metformin and simvastatin. Patient went back to work and have no symptoms until this 07Jan2020. Like almost 3 week or two and half weeks after he received the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Two and half weeks later he started having symptoms like shaking of the hands that I could barely write and yesterday he could barely walk down the stairs. The patient received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 22Dec2020. Immediately after the vaccination the patient felt that his hands became weak. He ignored it because it went away, like after a minute or so it went away. He went home and nothing happened, except for the soreness of the arm the injection site for 2 days, which really did not bother him. Then this past Thursday, 07Jan2021, he went to the church, he was lightning a candle and his hands started to shake, he can barely light a candle. He was able to do it although his hands were shaking. So, he went home. He ate breakfast, and called his neurologist and he said just to observe and then it went away. On Saturday night (09Jan2021) he noticed that his hands were shaking again when he was typing in the keyboard. He can manage to type but his hands were shaking. He went to sleep and just ignored it. Then yesterday, Sunday he worked again, it became worse, his handwriting was shaking. He was really holding on to the pen to write legibly and then he was in the third floor hospital, elevators did not work. So, he walked down through the stairs, both of his legs were shaking very bad while he was walking down three slides of stairs but he thought he came to the ground so he was able to walk on the flat floor on the street and able to walk home. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Outcome of the event tremor was unknown, while for the other events was unknown. The consumer considered a causal relationship between the events and the vaccine.

                                                upper bicep pain/soreness around upper part of bicep; tendonitis; lymphadenopathy; sore deltoid; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Healthcare Professional (patient).  This 58-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EI0142, expiry date Mar2021), intramuscular once to the left deltoid, on 28Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 58-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included an antihypertensive medication taking for several years. On 28Dec2020 the patient experienced side effects including sore deltoid (lasted for 2 days, Dec2020), and on 01Jan2021 the patient experienced upper bicep pain which he felt 5 days later (his friend said it may be lymphadenopathy).  The caller had the COVID vaccine on 28Dec2020, and from 28Dec2020 he had a sore deltoid for a couple days, but then almost a week later developed, he thought it was tendonitis, it was the upper part of his bicep, really he could not extend his arm all the way, it was so painful in that area, and it&#39;s still somewhat painful, but better. The sore deltoid was pretty much after the shot and into the next 48 hours, that went away, then he noticed this soreness around the upper part of his bicep, not until, probably, maybe 5 days later, on 01Jan2021. He was chatting with someone, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, that person felt it was lymph nodes, so maybe, there is possibility, caller thought this was muscle pain, as it hurts when he tried to extend his arm, it does not hurt when sitting here, but when he extends, especially over his head, it is really quite painful but it&#39;s lessened, he thought it was a tendonitis, but it could be the lymph nodes active or enlarged, he is not sure, he has never noticed lymph node pain, so he never knew what it was.  Causality for soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as yes. He is pretty sure, since he has not done anything that aggravated that muscle, he can&#39;t think of anything, and it is in the general vicinity of the injection. States he is on an antihypertensive medication, but has been taking it for several years. He doesn&#39;t want to go through a report for the person he spoke to, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, but it is interesting: the caller told him that had soreness, caller knows he also did report it, he reported it to Pfizer, actually he doesn&#39;t know if it was Pfizer or Moderna, but he reported it to whichever company, and said he thought was inflamed lymph nodes, so that was the first time he thought it was not muscle, but maybe the lymph node&#39;s reaction to vaccine, he has never experienced this kind of discomfort, he could not straighten his arm, as he would straighten the pain was at the upper insertion at the bicep, so that is where he came to this conclusion, his preliminary conclusions, he never thought it would persist this long. He thought, as time went by, it would be better tomorrow, and it has gotten better, but has not gone away.  Sore deltoid was reported as non-serious while soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as serious medically significant because it has persisted for so long, he would have not expected it to keep going on, but it is almost going on two weeks. Outcome of the event soreness around upper part of bicep, lymphadenopathy, and tendonitis was not recovered while the outcome of the sore deltoid was recovered in Dec2020. His second dose is scheduled tomorrow (14Jan2021) and wants to know if he can still take it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events myalgia and lymphadenopathy were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tendonitis with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

He reported that he has a history of blood clots in his right leg going back to 2018. He reported that his most recent DVT was in Aug2020 and he was cleared in Nov2020. He reported that he received the COVID-19 vaccine on 10Mar2021. He reported that on 15Mar2021, he started to notice his right leg swelling. He reported that he called his physician on 29Mar2021 and that his physician ordered an ultrasound. He reported that he had the ultrasound on 02Apr2021 and a deep vein thrombosis was found again. Swelling in right leg: he reported that the swelling has gone down. He reported that the reason that he mentioned that he has a history of blood clots was because of his warfarin dosage. He reported that he was first diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis in Jul2018. He reported that he went through that cycle and that his maintenance level of warfarin was maybe 10 or 12 mg of warfarin per day. He reported that he had another deep vein thrombosis in Aug2020, and since Aug2020 he has been on 17 mg of warfarin daily. He reported that the blood level on warfarin maintenance was supposed to be between 2 and 2.5. He reported that now because of the deep vein thrombosis he experienced in Aug2020, his doctor wanted his level to be at 2.5 to 3.5. He stated that he doesn&#39;t think that at that blood level for his warfarin that he should have gotten a blood clot. He reported that something compromised or interfered with the warfarin, resulting in a deep vein thrombosis. Discomfort when walking: he reported that it feels like his leg was compressing. He reported that the discomfort seems to have gotten better. He was queried for details of warfarin prescription. He reported that the 10 or 12 mg warfarin tablets that he had been taking when the blood clot was diagnosed in Aug2020 have been consumed and he no longer has the bottle. He reported that he did not have the bottle with him for his current warfarin prescription. He reported that the warfarin was not auto-refilled by the pharmacy. He reported that the warfarin was only prescribed a week or two at a time. Investigations: he reported that since Aug2020 when the deep vein thrombosis returned, he started doing self INR tests at home. He reported that he constantly self-monitors his INR at home and his levels were consistently at 3.0 to 3.1. He reported that he monitors his INR at least once a week, sometimes twice a week depending on how he feels. He reported that sometimes his INR goes over 4 and he can feel it. He reported that his system was a little off when it feels too high so he knows how to adjust. He reported that he last checked his INR today, 15Apr2021, and that it was 4.0. He reported that he typically checks his INR on Wednesday. He reported that he keeps a log of his INR levels. He reported that he did not see his physician on 29Mar2021, but that he called his physician and his physician wrote a prescription for the caller to get an ultrasound. Vaccination facility type was pharmacy. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room and physician office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He reported that he doesn&#39;t usually get vaccines. BNT162B2 second dose (lot number: ER5729) was administered on an unspecified date; anatomical location: left arm. The outcome of the events was recovering.

Working full shift.    Around 4 pm on Tuesday (after almost 3hrs OR case) - feeling very tired. Completed the working shift at 6 pm. Minor to moderate headache started to develop later in the evening. Two pills of Tylenol at 9 pm, another two around 2 am - while headache was getting worse.  @6:30 am Wednesday - informed managers that I&#39;ll have to stay off work because of bad headache (7 to 8 from 10), called EH as well.    During the day - mostly staying in the bed. Tylenol, water, tea with lemon, apples for hydration. Headache -- up and down (between 4 and 8), occasional fatigue and nausea (after staying upright more than 10-15 minutes), left upper arm pain, moderate pain in joints (knees, hips, low back). No fever.   Troubled night-time sleeping because of headache. 7 am - informed managers and EH about my condition, Got approval for another day off - with request to have a C-Test after that. Similar feeling and treatment.    Slow improvement during the day. Around 5 pm - feeling good enough to start moving more actively, headache and shoulder pain on low level, though getting tired quickly still.    Much better sleeping. No symptoms in the morning. Had a COVID test before returning to work.

At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.

On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January. At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down stairs as part of my daily activities.  The symptoms of shortness of breath only seemed to appear when I was on any form of extended walking activity or physical movements or exercise this would of have been starting around the 17th of January.  The right leg pain was masked by the heating rub while the shortness of breath continued for the next few days.  On the 19th of January,  I went to an Urgent Care Facility at 0800 am to see a Medical professional to discuss my symptoms I was previously experiencing and to figure out why I was having a shortness of breath and the pain in my right leg.  The on staff Physician&#39;s Assistant had a Nurse conduct a Covid 19 Rapids test (negative) and a second swab was administered and sent to the Lab.  Which produced a (negative for Covid 19) on the 20th of January.  An Xray was not taken to determine my shortness of breath.  The Dr listened to my lungs and heart,  though I did let the PA know I had received both Pfizer shots and when they were administered.  I was carrying My Shot record for the vaccine with the dates and lot number.   He didnt appear to be interested in further diagnosis and made sure I had the paperwork to track the results of my Covid swab sent to the lab. The visit was completed and I was released to go back to work/home.    I carried on the symptoms of the shortness of breath from the 19th of January to the 22nd of January monitoring my O2 (oxygen levels) with a pulse oximeter.  They ranged from 90-93.  On the evening of the 22nd of January I was becoming very uncomfortable with my breathing climbing the stairs in my home and monitored my O2 readings with the oximeter on my finger when walking upstairs and they dropped down to 60-65.  My wife drove me to the emergency room at Hospital.  I walked into the ER and checked myself in for shortness of breath and leg pain in my right leg.  I was admitted into the emergency room and put on 15 litres of oxygen.  The emergency room Dr ordered a chest Xray,  Cat Scan of my chest and heart and a sonogram of my right leg.  The testing results came back with a noted large pulmonary emboli on my lungs/heart area and blood clots throughout my right leg (right lower extremity DVT).    Surgery was performed to remove the pulmonary emboli and I was put on a Heprin Drip to thin out my blood for the remaining clots in my chest and my right leg. The attending physician ordered a T.E.E. (transesophageal Echocardiogram) to observe my heart functions.  I was told the TEE did not demonstrate any further recommend surgeries.  I was administered a test for my cardio and heart functions prior to my discharge on 27 January 2021.   I was prescribed Eloquis for maintenance medication to be monitored by followup visits to my cardiologist and Hemotologist within the next few weeks.  I have not family or personal history of Blood Clots.  I do perform administrative duties as part of my job, which requires sitting and working on a computer.  Note however I move around very often during a work day and operate a farm tractor and have an active life style.  I have not recently had any extended trips more than 2 hours nor have I flown within the past year or so.

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: ER8727, Expiration Date: Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 at 14:30 (at 59-year-old) at single dose in upper left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides. Concomitant medication(s) included hydrochlorothiazide/ lisinopril (LISINOPRIL/HCTZ) hypertension; citalopram; trazodone for sleep disorder; zolpidem for sleep disorder; simvastatin for blood cholesterol; alprazolam for anxiety (doctors said high dose which he needed to be stable, at least 7 years ago); and fenofibrate for blood triglycerides increased. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. E-transmitting possible duplicate AE as caller stated they already reported AE to previous agent. He had near all the side effects listed as well as severe allergic reactions listed. He hasn&#39;t been able to get out of the house since, felt like he had the flu. He has had the symptoms since; tiredness, headache, pain, terrible chills every day, joint pain, nausea, he was a hearty eater and he did not have a good appetite/ no appetite; he felt unwell, completely unwell, a sick feeling and it&#39;s pronounced; and particularly swollen lymph nodes, difficulty breathing at times, definite swelling of face and throat, dizziness and weakness. Caller provided these all started 2 weeks after he got the shot. Started on Saturday, 03Apr2021, and same thing happened everyday (going on). He called the weekend and after a couple weeks he called, the on call doctor and after his second call he was ordered to get to a medical facility/ urgent care facility (went to the doctor and it wasn&#39;t his regular doctor) in the weekend of 11Apr2021 and he has one nearby and they ran a test for COVID and it was negative, also tested for strep throat positive. He was given amoxycillin 30 tablets, 500mg tablets to be taken 3 times a day for 10 days for the strep throat, although he has not had any symptoms of strep throat which for him it is pronounced and painful, he can swallow, has no pain, no cough, nothing, he has nothing. His soreness and everything here was exactly what was in the manual was what he has going on and nothing else, no mucous, nothing like that. Confined to his house, has no energy to do anything chills and hot flashes. He has been taking ibuprofen 800mg tablets with food, 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening and got some relief from the chills and symptoms but not totally and it was waning in it&#39;s effectiveness after the first 3-4 days. All his symptoms were persisting and they had worsened after he started getting then for he guesses 4-5 days and then they kind of leveled as bad as they are now and haven&#39;t tailed off. He was ordered not to take the 2nd dose until he finishes all the amoxicillin and was told quite sternly not to get the 2nd dose until he finishes it. He has 12 pills left so next week sometime Tuesday or Wednesday and his concern was he finished that medicine and feels he would still have these side effects and doesn&#39;t know if he would build up immunity and maybe the 2nd shot won&#39;t be as bad. The nurse practitioner who worked with him at the urgent medical care place said the 2nd shot is a doozy and not to mix it with Amoxicillin as it might have a bad effect on the effectiveness of the strep throat. States he has had strep before and doesn&#39;t feel like that at all and nothing is wrong with his voice, throat or upper respiratory at all. He is supposed to get the 2nd shot tomorrow (16Apr2021), he was scheduled. He was afraid to do it as he hears it&#39;s worse than the 1st one and he is already relegated to his house and has to order in and not risk driving that&#39;s how foggy his brain was with what&#39;s going on his thinking is not straight from the pain. The outcomes of the events were unknown.
