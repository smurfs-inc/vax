A 76-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history reported as none. Family history included wife who passed away 2.5 years before, on an unspecified date and his daughter and her (daughter) son, who lives with the patient, tested positive for COVID virus. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced little bit of fever, allergies, and feeling unwell, but described as not horribly bad. Patient stated he is ok and doesn&#39;t think it has anything to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. He stated that he thinks it is just allergies due to the pollen. Patient was taking two to three Ibuprofen once or twice a day when he goes to sleep. He has been perspiring quite a bit at night, which he stated was ok. Aside from that he was pretty much ok. He doesn&#39;t get second dose until 15Feb2021. Stated we have come a long way from beginnings of time where people would just die. He asked if he should get tested. Patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician. He stated his symptoms began in the evening of 16Jan2021 at 8pm. He started getting a little feverish and sluggish. He took three Ibuprofen. He thought he lost some weight with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Weight was between 169-170lbs on 16Jan2021. The patient operates a daycare center with children. He was not taking any medication except for the Ibuprofen. He is very active and runs a business. Only thing is, he is sad because he does not have his wife with him. He stated everything was fine. He wanted to know if it was possible one can get the COVID virus even with the injection. He asked about the second COVID-19 Vaccine and what does the first dose do. Treatment included ibuprofen for little bit of fever, sluggish, and Feeling unwell. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of fever, sluggish, weight decreased, night sweats and feeling unwell  due to temporal relationship  Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject drug contributed to the event of pollen allergy, which likely represent intercurrent medical condition.  There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.

I spoke with my doctor he told me to put bacitracin on it for few days but it&#39;s still there. It&#39;s less itchy but the red dot is still there its 2-3 inches from the injection site and also said, I think I&#39;m going to skip the second dose.

This is typical of when I get viral diseases such as colds and flu, except that there were no cold symptoms in my head.  First noticed when I awoke the day after my second shot and lasted into late afternoon.  OK after that.

                                                Same evening of vaccine injection 3/24 - chills and severe headache and extreme fatigue.   Overnight - nausea, vomiting and fever 102.6.  Next morning 3/25, woke up and tried to get out of bed.  Legs were so weak they gave out and I fell out of bed on the floor.   I had no strength to get back up to get on the bed.  My wife could not lift me, so she called 911 for a &#34;lift assist&#34;.  Paramedics were told I received the 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine the day before, so they picked me up off of the floor and put me back in bed.  They took my vitals - blood pressure was 116/73 and temperature was still 102.6.  Paramedics offered to take me to the hospital but I refused.  Paramedics told my wife that if my breathing became labored, she should get me to the ER or call 911 again.    I was not able to get out of bed the whole day on Thursday 3/25, because I was so weak I could not stand up, and I also had body aches and had to use a urinal because I could not walk to the bathroom.  My wife gave me Tylenol and the fever finally broke late evening of Thursday 3/25 and I started to feel a little bit better.  I had not eaten all day, but my wife made sure I stayed hydrated with water.  On Friday morning 3/26 I was able to sit up on the side of the bed, and I was able to walk with the assistance of a cane to the bathroom.  Extreme fatigue affected me all day Friday, but I did feel better.  Fever did not come back after it broke.  Saturday 3/27 - still experiencing extreme fatigue, but feel better overall.

At the time, I only had soreness of the left arm at the injection site and virtually no other symptoms except a mild headache for a few hours.  However, during the month or so between the vaccines and post-vaccine period, I developed pain in both shoulders with moderate-severe rotator cuff symptoms. This was pain in reaching in almost any direction. Also, I began to notice heaviness in both upper legs, front and back, which in a week or so progressed to tiredness and then to achiness, and finally to pain when I would squat, bend over, or get up from a chair. I have  never had either symptom before.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 08Mar2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program from a contactable consumer (patient). A 76-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL8982) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 30Jan2021 at 12:10 (at the age of 76-years-old) as a single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. In 2021, the patient experienced sore neck muscles in back for 2 days. The patient was asked if it is possible to take the second dose to different place. The patient did not receive any treatments for the events. There was no admission to hospital involved due to the events. The outcome of the events was resolved in 2021. The patient was scheduled to get the vaccine after 4 weeks. On 26Feb2021, the patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had no discomfort after second dose.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                joint pain in his big toe on his left foot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself). A 77-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL9262, NDC/UPC number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid (also reported as the left shoulder) on 29Jan2021 at 09:30 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was reported as the public health clinic/veterans administration facility. Relevant medical history included sleep problem. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included promethazine (strength: 25 mg) for sleep problem. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient had the Pfizer COVID vaccine shot on Friday morning, on 29Jan2021, and later that day by the evening, he started to experience some joint pain in his big toe on his left foot and the pain had not changed or gone away since then. The patient assessed the event as non-serious. The adverse event did not require any visit to the physician office or emergency room. The patient further stated that he haven&#39;t done anything. It happened on Friday and it was there the day prior reporting (yesterday), and it was there in the morning at the time of the report, and the patient was just kind of waiting to see if it would get any better. So, he haven&#39;t done anything and was asking what he should do about that. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of joint pain in his big toe on his left foot, which included that the patient took some paracetamol (TYLENOL), but it didn&#39;t really seem to help much, so he didn&#39;t take anymore. The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient was not recovered from the event.

Most symptoms are improved at this time, but still some tiredness and muscle and joint pain.

                                                Following Dose 1,  Right Arm became sore at injection site for 4 days, at which time Right armpit became very tender touch and was swollen about size of silver dollar, approx. 1/2 inch thick.  Soreness at injection site subsided over the next 17 days, but tenderness in armpit only diminished slightly.  Following Dose 2, Right Arm was once again sore at injection site for about 4 days, but tenderness to the right armpit became more pronounced, with swelling increasing to the size of a hockey puck.  Size of swelling was easily visible to the eye.  Armpit became more tender to the touch, and has diminished only slightly in size,, as of this reporting.  Mass remains soft to the feel, but easily defined in size and location.  I have taken OTC pain killers to help with the discomfort.  Will continue to monitor its progress, unless notified otherwise.  Do not anticipate seeing my physician at this point.  Have consulted the Web, and have noted that this is a lesser side effect of this vaccine, if swelling remains localized to the injection site.  Thought I should report this side effect only because of the size of the swelling that occured.

By mid-afternoon had to go to bed and slept for hours. Got up at 9PM and went back to bed at 11PM. Sunday was better, but this AM (Monday) awakened with itchy skin, pins and needles on hands and feet (gone now) and total exhaustion. Had difficulty breathing (better now), can barely lift arms and had to miss work and went back to bed. I am reporting this because I am scheduled for a 2nd shot on the 26th and not certain it&#39;s a good idea.

                                                Awakening  on Saturday, March 13, I saw blood on my pillow and a pee spot on the bed (my first time for either).  I could barely get out of bed (an awkward rollover did it).  My tongue was numb (still is) and raw from the presumed chewing on it.  Walking was slow and painful as all muscles hurt.  If I sneezed or coughed, my back would hurt.  Those last problems are still true. I periodically cough up phlegm and lacking a good place to spit it out, I just swallow it.  I have for the first time in my life been using a walker for stability. Right arm is almost useless due to pain.

A 78-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) intramuscular at single dose at left deltoid on 11Jan2021 around 13:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at hospital.  Medical history was none, he was basically healthy. There were no concomitant medications. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks), but the patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose exactly 3 weeks before 1st dose on 21Dec2020 for covid-19 immunisation. No additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. The patient began to have muscle pain, chills, and weakness about 8 hours or so after the 2nd vaccine on 11Jan2021. He states these symptoms have maybe gotten a little better, but have been continuing on for 2-3 days now. He is also experiencing perfuse sweating during 13Jan2021night. Right now, he was not experiencing this. Maybe a little bit, but not much. The caller experienced mild tenderness of arm on 12Jan2021: he explained when you press his arm, it hurts a little bit. No events required a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of muscle pain was and perfuse sweating was unknown, of chills, weakness was recovering, of mild tenderness of arm was not recovered. The patient was his own primary doctor. The reporter considered all events as medically significant and he believed these symptoms are related to receiving the vaccine because he stated he was okay before that.   No further information expected. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event muscle pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.

Same on 4th day after vaccine, aspirin and heat no positive effect.  5th day took 50mg pill of diclofenac, next day great improvement and mobility almost fine but with some lingering neck pain for a week.

My arm movement seems to be good and is not painful when I move it. I have to elevate my arm in a sling type position as the day goes on it gets more painful otherwise. I have called my doctor but have not  heard back from him, I am expecting  him to call me today, so I can get his opinion on what might be wrong with my shoulder. I have my second virus short scheduled for Feb. 25,2021 at 9:30 am at the same place.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown. Patient had no further information to provide regarding testing/investigations/lab work, blood work, imaging, x-rays, etc for this report. Outcome of events were reported as unknown.

                                                There was a significant drug interaction with Efudex Cream that I was applying topically to a pre-cancerous 2-cm-diameter lesion on my left shin. On the day of my first Pfizer shot, the Efudex treated lesion was progressing normally from the desquamation (scabbing and shedding of epithelial scales) to the erosion stage (starting to form a shallow 2.5-cm-diameter ulcer). Starting about Saturday 30 January (three days after the first Pfizer shot) and slowly increasing for the next four days, the Efudex-treated ulcer became deeper, the peripheral 12-cm-diameter skin became redder, and the left foot and ankle became increasingly swollen.  My RN-wife and I (a former medical-research physicist) began research andChronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg &amp; foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral. Chronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg &amp; foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral.DVERSE EFFECTS, TREATMENT, AND OUTCOME:  discovered that Efudex should not be given concurrently with any of a long list of immunizations.  This is an Efudex problem that should gain another immunization onto that list. Being within a week of finishing the Efudex regimen, we monitored the Efudex-treatment area and the peripheral area carefully. On Thursday 4 Feb (eight days after the first Pfizer shot), the ulcer began unusual drainage, the 12-cm-diameter peripheral area became inflamed, and swelling of the left ankle and foot increased to almost skin-tight - I can upload photos if you need.  Time for immediate action.  My excellent Dermatologist stopped Efudex and started me on Bactrim by mouth for 10 days, and Gentamicin topical antibiotic on the ulcerated central area and Triamcinolone topical corticosteroid on the peripheral and swollen areas for three weeks.  Good choices.  Improvement was immediate and continued improving for the next three weeks.  By the time of the second Pfizer shot on 24 February, the central area was healing well, in the late-reepithelialization stage (regrowth of epithelial tissue that now formed a completely-covering scar tissue with no oozing), and with all inflammation and swelling completely gone.  After the second Pfizer shot (taken 20 days after stopping Efudex), there were zero adverse effects of any kind. NOTE: There were absolutely zero other adverse effects of any kind throughout the entire series: no chills, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in pulse or blood pressure (120/70 range), loss of taste or smell, sore throat, cough, lung congestion, fatigue, feeling of being unwell, shortness of breath, injection-site swelling or redness, hives, swelling of face, decreased kidney function, or other adverse cardiovascular, neurological or pulmonary effects. There was no additional joint pain above my normal osteoarthritis.  After both shots, I felt a slight normal-range injection-site soreness for the next few hours, but no site swelling, rash, redness, or other problem.  We recommend that this immunization be added to the Efudex  proscribed or warned&#39; list.

Went for a routine physical with my Doctor at 1PM and never made it there.  I had no idea of where I was going or where I had been.  Half hour later I remember being in a store buying lottery tickets and the clerk had to help me in my car. Went to bed for the rest of the day and have been improving little by little each day. Was  very, very tired at first and still a little tired now.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that he is in good physical health. The patient stated that he is 79 years old, and received his first dose of the COVID vaccine 48 hours ago, on Monday at noon (11Jan2021). The patient strained his back last night (12Jan2021), and he is having some muscle pain, and he would like to know if it is okay to take Ibuprofen, following having received the vaccine. The patient clearly stated that he has had no side effects and he is fine from the vaccine. He also added that it was while he was in the shower last night, he twisted his back a little bit, and that happens to him now and then and that was normally when this happens to him, it takes a few days to get better. But patient stated that this event is totally unrelated to the COVID vaccine. The patient normally just takes a Motrin, and it clears the pain up, it relieves it. But he was just wondering if it is contraindicated to take Motrin after having had the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events back strain and muscle pain were intercurrent conditions and unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccination.

On third day after second vaccination,  should symptoms gone but I started to develop diffuse myalgias.  By 4th day, began having problems with my memory. I could not figure out some instructions on a computer program. I had some trouble recognizing a common object in my hand.  Then mild ataxia.  Excessive sleepiness in 2-3 hour intervals.  On 8th day, developed  abdominal pain similar to diverticulitis. And became very constipated. I had forgotten to take the Parnate and missed two doses. I had forgotten to take Metamucil and Miralax. these led to the constipation and abdominal pain.  On advice of psychopharmacologist, I resumed Parnate  and started to feel better.  I resumed laxatives and good effect. Abdominal symptoms abated in two additional days.  I had gone to ER  but seen only informally by my medical friends. After 3 hour, and getting better, I left.   Blood tests were normal.  No exam.   Since 02/27/2021, I have felt perfectly normal.   Recovered.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports, reporting for self. This 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) via unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID virus in Aug2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM and got a reaction around 9 PM. The patient stated a lot of the same symptoms from the COVID virus came back after the vaccine. The first thing was chills, patient took a couple of paracetamol (TYLENOL), and they went away after about a half hour. The patient had a low grade fever 101.9 at 29Jan2021 night to 30Jan2021, and took paracetamol then as well. The patient reported the biggest thing was everything hurt including muscles and head.

The symptoms were from 29Jan2021 night until probably 31Jan2021 morning noon, then he started to feel little bit better. The patient hardly miss work, but missed work on 30Jan2021. The patient stated feeling pretty good and pretty much back to normal on 01Feb2021, it did not affect breathing or cough, just fever and feeling lousy. The patient commented that he can relate to COVID because he had had the COVID and for 2 weeks he was like that. He also had the breathing problem with the virus in Aug2020, and he think he had every symptom but did not lose taste or smell. The patient asked if he should take his second dose of vaccine. The outcome of event chills was resolved on 29Jan2021. The outcome of event fever was resolved on 30Jan2021. The outcome of other events was resolving.

When I open my right hand my ring finger would hang up and not extend with the others.  It would lock up half way open  and then extend the rest of the way.  The condition has not changed since.  I had my second shot on 02/10/2021 at 2pm.  I didn&#39;t see a doctor about it since it is not critical except for a little lose of dexterity.

A 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 19Jan2021, at single dose, to prevent COVID, at a hospital. Medical history included lung cancer (19-year lung cancer survivor), mild heart attack in 2011, aortic valve replacement in 2013 and a heart issue. Concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included influenza vaccine received on 06Nov2020 for immunization. The patient reported that on he had the first vaccine shot on 19Jan2021 (10 days ago) and on 20Jan2021, when he raised his left arm where the vaccine was given, he felt a twinge of pain where that was, and a kind of numbness, it was nothing that restricts him in any way, but when he exercised in the morning and lifted his arm over his head he felt the twinge of pain, which was something he never experienced with the flu vaccine or any other vaccines. He wondered if it had something to do with this vaccine. He has not treated it, it has not bothered him much. He stated he feels it when he exercises it and swings his left arm, then he feels a bit tightness or a twinge of pain. He says it does not restrict him or cause him to cry out or anything. The patient also reported that he is scheduled for the second dose on 09Feb2021 and stated that he needs to get a dental procedure done on 04Feb2021 and needs to take amoxicillin for it due to past heart issue. The patient wanted to know if it is okay to take amoxicillin and was wondering if this medication will interfere with the second dose. He also asked if he should cancel the dental procedure. The patient mentioned that he had his annual wellness visit on an unspecified date and they did a lipid profile (unknown results) but it was not relevant in his opinion. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 80-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNtech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL1283) , via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 01:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included open heart surgery 11 years ago, covid-19 from Jul2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received bnt162b2 yesterday, with no problems. However today (18Jan2021), in 15 minutes after waking up at 11, he had the chills really bad, that went away, then he went to sleep again and woke up and he had all the symptoms on the paperwork, he had dizziness, headache, he&#39;s hardly ever had a headache ever. He had aches and pain. Caller states that he was just asking right now about another company, and their vaccine in started with an M, and her daughter is at a girls home, because she has a epileptic type thing, and this particular shot, that started with M, the nurse called over, and the problems that he is having he explained to the nurse is like when he had the virus previously about in Jul2020, when he had the virus he was in hospital for a week, because he had to get rid of the virus, and they got him out of that. Now he took this shot yesterday and the next day is when he got all these symptoms, he&#39;s tired, cant walk, muscle pain, had chills not any more, pain in the knees, everywhere really, he couldn&#39;t get any position to go back to sleep, his back knees elbow joint pain. Since he had these things, the nurse at the girls home, told his wife if having these problems he can take 300 mg of Zinc, 1000mg of Vitamin C, and 2000IU or Vitamin D, the same thing, that amount, he asks will it over come the symptoms. Another person felt good after getting those, it helped him he does state however that is what the person took when he actually had the Covid 19 Virus. Caller states that he received paperwork after the vaccine from the (State), it has a bunch of blocks asking if he has this or that symptom. His First dose was 17Jan2021 at 1:15, then on 07Feb2021 if this Second Dose. All the side effects started Today 18Jan2021. His doctor said he&#39;s in good health. He did have open heart surgery 11 years ago. The patient reported he is 5 feet 8 and a half inches, he is shrinking. He stated, &#34;I was good until this morning, it hit me like I had the virus. The product they gave me at the (State) was the Pfizer-biontech vaccine. I had all the symptoms except vomiting/throwing up. I got all the other symptoms. no matter which way I turned it was hurting, knees, everything was hurting really bad. I was dizzy and weak so I don&#39;t want to walk around too much. I had muscle pain, joint pain, fever, headaches, chills, never went away. I hurt everywhere. I am really weak. My eyes are hurting. My daughter is in a girls home (paralysis problem). They had the vaccine from the another company and they have heard so many negative stuff so they decided they did not want to, when my wife told her I was having these problems. I had the virus 4 months, the nurse told me to take 300mg of zinc, 1000mg vitamin C and 2000mg vitamin D (the person took that when he had the disease). Should I take this stuff? Is there any information on that? what&#39;s in this? protein? my wife got the disease. They said she had enough antibodies. How long is the immunity? When does it start?&#34; The outcome of the event chills was resolved, of other events was unknown.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

By 3/1, I also had thigh and buttock ache with effort and left TMJ pain. On 3/2, I saw Dr. My sed rate was 24. She made a diagnosis of probable PMR and prescribed prednisone. After I single dose, my symptoms almost magically abated and I was almost normal. On 3/11, the only residual symptom with soreness with with extreme neck rotation. On clinical grounds, this confirms the diagnosis of PMR. I assume treatment will continue for several weeks.

This happened  again at 5 a.m.and 7 a.m. when he awakened to urinate. He called his doctor that morning who advised him to go to the ER to rule out a stroke. He was admitted overnight for observation. A CT scan of the head was negative for stroke. He had a follow up MRI head which was also negative for stroke. He will follow up with his neurologist.

A 81 years old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247 or EL3427), via an unspecified route of administration at Arm Left on 21Jan2021 09:33 at the 81 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   The medical history was none. The family medical history was none. The concomitant medications included warfarin from Mar2012 for Atrial fibrillation( AFib) and standard medications . The patient was not feeling well. All occurred on 21Jan2021 18:00, the patient developed symptoms, such as aches all over his body, aches all over with muscles pains with muscle pains, headache, joint pain, chills, injection site pain on left arm, body slightly warm, felt slightly warm, feeling unwell. He had chills all night and could not get warm. The reporter had not taken the patient&#39;s temperature yet. The patient takes regular medications. The patient was on warfarin and standard medications. The reporter stated the vaccine cards were mixed up because they did not write their names on them and the vaccine lot numbers looks like they were mixed up. Someone probably made a mistake because one says EL3247 and the other says EL3427, so she is not sure which it is. The handwriting is different on the cards. There was no Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. There was not Emergency Room Visit or physician&#39;s office required Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                Sore injection shoulder extending to the other shoulder; 2 degree temperature; chills. Lasted about 24 hours. I also had some scattered, small red bumps over my arms and legs and several tender bumps on my head. The toes on my left foot had a reddish appearance. These symptoms lasted about 5 days and may or may not be related to the vaccination. At my age, random unexplained symptoms are not unusual.

                                                Patient is a 81 y.o. gentleman with a history of smoldering multiple myeloma, urinary retention for which he self catheterizes twice daily, as well as recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation that presents complaining of increasing weakness and falls.  Patient fell 2/18 pm trying to get out of bed and he took about 20 minutes to get himself to a position where he could pull himself back up.  Again 2/19 he was trying to get up and his legs were too weak to carry him and he fell to the ground.  He needed assistance to get up and family asked him to come to emergency room for evaluation.  He has been feeling poorly for about a month, with poor appetite and has lost about 15 pounds.  He is not nauseated or short of breath and has no cough.  He was apparently treated for UTI about 4 to 6 weeks ago after a visit to urgent care.  He has since been to a different urgent care and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which was new in onset and was referred to a cardiologist who is planning to do a stress test in a few weeks.  I believe he is on Eliquis now.  In ER he was found to have significant pyuria and bacteriuria and was given a dose of Rocephin.  Renal function shows worsening from levels in December although it is pretty stable over the past month from looking through other labs.

                                                Developed watery diarrhea; malaise; weight loss; collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). An 81-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included was none. No covid prior vaccination. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included allopurinol (ALLOPURINOL), losartan potassium (COZAAR), tadalafil (TADALAFIL), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPRIN), simvastatin (ZOCOR). Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 details: (Product= COVID 19) for covid-19 immunisation, Lot number= EL1284, Administration date= 31Dec2020, administration time= 11:00 AM, vaccine location: Left arm, dose number= 1, Developed watery diarrhea about 5 days after the dose. No other vaccine in four weeks. Adverse event: watery diarrhea improved somewhat but worsened again after the second dose of vaccine, along with some malaise and weight loss, since 05Jan2021. Extensive investigations eventually revealed collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies in Jan2021. May well be coincidence, but interested to know if others have been reported. AE resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Anti-diarrheals, budesonide. The event outcome of collagenous colitis was recovering, watery diarrhea was  not recovered, outcome of other event was unknown. Covid test post vaccination covid test date=19Jan2021, which was negative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies and bnt162b2 cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association.

                                                My RA began to really act up.  My whole body stiffened up-(legs, hands, hips, back).  Lower back made it hart to bend over, Rt shoulder had a swelling and hurt at a pinch point in shoulder, my rt hip hurt when I walked more than 0.25 miles, my hands swelled and could not use hand well. Did not initially link to Covid shot, so called my Rheumatologist on the sixth day that the symptoms continued.  Received prescription to reduce muscle  tension and an anti inflamatory.  However, a couple of days after talking to my doctor and before taking any of the prescribed meds, the symptoms went away and since that time, my RA is back to typical old symptoms and pain level.

A 81-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL9261, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 21Jan2021at 12:50 as a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included back pain and arthritis. Concomitant medications include propafenone taking for more 5 year still ongoing for indication atrial fibrillation and dutasteride taking for a year and half still ongoing for indication prostate. No history of all previous immunization with Pfizer vaccine and no prior vaccination in four weeks. On 21Jan2021, received first dose of the vaccine about 2 and a half weeks ago. He stated, it went fine but the day after, on 22jan2021 had some muscle tenderness (local light pain) and stiff neck and shoulder developed that was pretty mild but it was still going. It&#39;s about 2 and a half weeks now. In the morning it was maybe a tad more stiff mostly on left arm, it improved some when walking around and with exercising so he doesn&#39;t have to take medication. He stated, when you don&#39;t move it doesn&#39;t hurt, it&#39;s when you move the neck muscle that it was sore but not much at all. At his age you have back pain and a little arthritis. It was strange that it started the day of or day after. He stated he did report just a bit of local pain but only when you touch the area and a very mild muscle pain, but it has continued and he doesn&#39;t know if it was related. He asked if this was related to the vaccine and how long this typically lasts. Mentioned he has had this pain before but he feels that he has avoided exercise or yoga or anything that would cause it now. he does have arthritis in his back. He was scheduled to receive the second dose of the vaccine on 11Feb2021. He didn&#39;t receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of the events was still unsure if he had this before vaccine or not and its persisting.The outcome of all events were not recovered.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right shoulder on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 81-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, stage 3 renal failure (was not bad, was in stage 5 couple of years ago, was a month or so away from full failure, was in the hospital and had dialysis, was able to get reversed with medication and diet), high blood pressure, and blood cholesterol increased/high cholesterol. The reporter stated that with regards to patient&#39;s height, he shrunk a little. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, didn&#39;t get flu shots. Concomitant medications include about 12 other unspecified drugs, takes statins, has high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Patient started experiencing pain behind his left knee about 6 or 7 days later in Mar2021 (also reported as 04 or 05Apr2021, pending clarification). By that Sunday, it had gotten worse. The leg swelled and was also having foot swelling because blood flow wasn&#39;t there. There was no TIA&#39;s no stroke, no heart racing, no sweating, was all pain. Got leg up and kept elevated until they could get to the doctor and get imaging. Patient went Monday 08Mar2021 to see the doctor. Patient was brought to the doctor and was then sent to the imaging place. Radiology read the imaging around 5:15pm on the Monday, 08Mar2021. The radiologist said there was 2.5&#34; blood clot behind the left knee. He had never had a blood clot before. Patient was then sent to the Emergency Room at (Name) Hospital, in (Name) where they live. Was kept there several hours. Did a lot more blood tests. He was immediately put on 10mg ELIQUIS 10mg, once in the morning, and once at night. He is now taking 5mg Eliquis in the morning, and 5mg at night. He has not had any of these problems before the Pfizer shot. The reporter knew that not a lot had been reported. It seemed it should be safe. The correlation and timing having the shot on 23Feb2021 and all of a sudden a week and a half later this happened. It was 10 days later. There was nothing they can do about it. Just continuing with the ELIQUIS, trying to dissolve the blood clot, will be staying on it for 4 to 6 months. It was a pretty big blood clot and were worried about it breaking up and traveling. The patient had no other symptoms, had a sore arm, that was it. Patient going back to (Name) 01Jun2021 and he will have another CT scan or ultra sound when they get back. The reporter did not want to need to get the leg amputated. Patient was only in the ER, was not admitted to the hospital. Patient was concerned because of his age. If it doesn&#39;t dissolve, they know there will be a lot more trouble. The event of pain left knee, blood clot and sore arm required a visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 on 01Apr2021 (lot number: ER8730) in the right arm. The outcome of events was unknown.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) first dose on 30Dec2020 10:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that I had the vaccine back a week and half ago on 30Dec2020 and was due to get the booster this month and wanted to report severe pain arm for two days. The patient stated that he had many vaccine (Unspecified Vaccine) over the years and have never had anything that hurts so bad after about six hours. The patient just wanted to know that was that normal. Consumer further stated, &#34;I took the vaccine about 10:30 in the morning and about four hours later, it started getting sore but that thing was normal you know some vaccines (Unspecified Vaccine) do that but along with that it started hurting about four hours after the vaccine and it continued to get worse and that night I went to bed and I cannot sleep, it hurts so bad. The patient even have thoughts about getting up and go in to the emergency room. It was the worst pain I have ever had and I could not move my arm. I could not sleep on the right side or on a left side and all I did was take Tylenol as prescribed and that helped a little bit but not much but I did not go to the emergency room, I am not going to do that but I felt like it because it hurts so bad but I made it through the night and next day it continued to hurt really bad. I just keep taking Tylenol every four hours and that continued for two days and then finally I was able to raise my arm up above my head without little pain, it was discomfort, but it was not hurting so bad.&#34; The patient stated that the event started about two hours later it started, it started hurting and then it continued to get worse and worse and it was severe, that is the reason why I am calling that it was severe. I wanted a shot or morphine to relieve myself that how bad it was.&#34; (no clarified further). The patient stated that the vaccine was given in my left arm only about one inch below the top of my shoulder which I think that might have been the problem, I don&#39;t know if you can answer that or not but I have never received the vaccine or shot anywhere near that area, it is always three or four inches down in my muscle, on my arm either on left or right, this was given in my left arm but this was given almost in my joint I am wondering if that would cause pain.&#34; The patient stated it was given only one inch below the tip above shoulder may be that is causing so much pain.&#34; The patient just wanted to report the severe pain, that was for two whole days and then it was subsided and it lasted for four days and I still have uncomfortable feeling in my arm. I was finally able to raise it above my head, my left arm, after two days but it was not comfortable to do it, it was painful.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 82-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient also started to receive mirtazapine (MIRTAZAPINE, 50 mg, Capsule, soft), via an unspecified route of administration, from an unspecified date at 50 mg, once a day for sleep. Medical history included sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], calcium, escitalopram, finasteride, lamotrigine, simvastatin, tamsulosin. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported receiving the Pfizer vaccine in his right arm on 06Feb2021. That evening he took his nightly medication and went to bed at 11:30 pm. He stated he wasn&#39;t able to sleep because he felt like he was in a refrigerator and he was shaking. He had lower back pain, right arm/shoulder pain, and went to the bathroom 5 times (all on an unspecified date in Feb2021), which was not normal for him. The patient added that it was the second dosage of the Pfizer (Covid-19 Vaccine) her received on 06Feb2021. And he had some negative response: a little pain in his shoulder but the worst thing that happened, he went to bed 11:30 did not sleep at all. At 11:30 night, he took his medication (Mirtazapine) and went to bed. He was shaking and he had to put another blanket on himself. Eventually, it was okay, but the problem is he was not able to sleep all night, from 11:30 to 9&#39; O clock this morning (07Feb2021). Consumer stated, &#34;Yesterday my wife and I had the second dose of the Pfizer and I had really strange reaction and I will tell you what it was. Last night at about 11:30 I took my night medicine (later clarified as Mirtazapine), I went to bedroom, I started shaking all over. And the worst part is from 11:30 to 10 o&#39; clock this morning, I was not able to sleep. There is slight pain in my shoulder&#34;. When confirmed if the consumer wanted to report the same or have any questions, consumer stated, &#34;No, we have no problem with temperature is fine, the oxygen is fine. Just I don&#39;t understand why in fact the medication (mirtazapine) is to induce sleeping, use to for sleep within half hour but it didn&#39;t help. I wanted to know what happened. So, this will eventually go away?&#34; The action taken in response to the events for mirtazapine was unknown. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on batch number has been requested.

An 83-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9261; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 26Jan2021 at 8:30 to 9 AM, at a single dose, for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history in Mar2020 included had a temperature for 7 days. He tested positive for COVID and it took a while to test negative. At the end of Mar2020 until the first of Apr2020, his temperature was 97 something. He has checked his temperature every day since then. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. He did not receive additional vaccines on the same date bnt162b2 was given. The patient had his first COVID-19 shot yesterday morning about 8:30 or 9:00. He hadn&#39;t really looked at the list of side effects, but yesterday afternoon (26Jan2021), he had slight pain in the arm where the shot was given. If he moved his arm, he would have slight discomfort. The pain was mostly gone today. He also had some slight tenderness in his shoulder, but it&#39;s certainly less than what it was yesterday. He saw other things that were listed including fever. He wanted to know if Pfizer had any information as what to amount of fever people typically experience after having the shot.  Yesterday (unspecified date in Jan2021), his temperature was 97 something. This morning, he got up at 6 am and his temperature was around 98.8. And then he had to take his wife to therapy and when he got back 3 hours later, he took it now and his temperature was 99 degrees. He was just wondering if Pfizer had an idea of how much fever is normal from the shot?  He hasn&#39;t had any other reactions. The events did not require Emergency Room or Physician&#39;s Office visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 97 something on 26Jan2021, 98.8 and 99 on 27Jan2021; sars-cov-2 test: positive on an unspecified date in 2020 and negative on an unspecified date in 2020. Outcome of the event &#34;slight pain in his arm the shot was given&#34; was recovering, while for the other events was unknown.

On 12Feb2021, he got congestion in his chest and a real deep coughing, and then he started hurting at the base of his neck. The patient used a chest rub which helped break up some of the congestion, but he is still coughing. On unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient also experienced his head was hurting in the back of it, and his shoulders were hurting from his neck down his arms to his elbow; his shoulders had been hurting so bad, he thought they would come off. Now (Feb2021), when he gets up, his back is giving him trouble, and he can&#39;t stand up long because of the weakness. His body also seemed to want to walk backward on his heels when he stands up and he is wanting to fall (Feb2021). The patient has been taking his dog out every morning, but it is hard to do that now because he can&#39;t stand up that well (Feb2021). Therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the event congestion in his chest. Outcome of the event real deep coughing was not recovered while outcome of all the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 85-years-old male patient (reporter&#39;s grandfather) received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL9262, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 01Feb2021 (at 85 years of age) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. On 01Feb2021 the patient felt great; on 02Feb2021 he felt ok but was tired; on 03Feb2021 his groin started to hurt, it hurt even to touch it, his leg started to bother him from his groin down and then was unable to be touched; the reporter asked if that could be swollen lymph nodes from the vaccine. At 3 o&#39;clock the patient rushed to the hospital and, on 04Feb2021, he was admitted to hospital due to pain in groin. They thought he had broken something but that was ruled out. The patient underwent an X-ray of his leg and labs. He does not have any infection. At the time of the report the patient was still in hospital and the events &#34;groin started to hurt&#34; had not resolved yet and outcome of the event &#34;tired&#34; was unknown.

                                                Within 36 hours, 2/27 my knees swelled and I was unable to walk.  On Sunday we went to The ER  near where we were and had x-rays and ultrasound of my knee. Dr. took a fluid sample for culture but said it looked clear. I have no history of arthritis nor any injury. I am an avid bike rider and suddenly cannot stand on my feet due to extreme pain.

I could not sleep much on March 8 evening. The pain persisted all day Tuesday March 9, 2021.  I called my ortho doctor and made a morning appointment for March 10, 2021 at 8:15am. I did not sleep much on evening of March 9. On Wednesday March 10 I went to the doctor. On this morning, the upper back muscles were OK, and the pain and spasms wer now in the neck. I could hardly move my head up or down and left and right. Dr. perscribed Methylprednazolone (4mg, 6-5-4-3-2-1 doses) and cyclobenzaprine 5mg (3x daily).  after 1 day and 1 dose, I feel I can movemy head a little farther without the stabbing pain.

Per ED note, &#34;Based on the patient history, physical, and initial vital signs - the patient&#39;s initial presentation is concerning for heart failure/volume overload-&gt;pulmonary edema and bilateral pedal edema.&#34; He received ipratropium neb x1 and returned to facility. Neurology consulted (12/22/20), &#34;It is difficult to determine whether the patient has a new facial palsy or whether this is recrudescence of his previous stroke deficits. Given the swelling of his left face it is quite possible that there is inflammation causing some partial left facial nerve dysfunction that would not include the forehead. The pattern of weakness is, however, also consistent with what would be expected from his documented right MCA stroke. At this point it is appropriate to consider this a possible complication of his vaccination (Bell&#39;s palsy has been reported in some after Covid19 vaccination). However, I would not recommend any specific treatment for the facial weakness as the etiology is still somewhat unclear.&#34; Patient admitted to hospital 1/2/21-1/8/21 for mild hypothermia with possible AMS and found to have adenovirus. Head CT negative for CVA. Sepsis/toxic/metabolic w/u was unrevealing. Given IVF for diarrhea; C diff negative. Discharged to facility. Patient received 2nd COVID-19 pfizer vaccine on 1/13/21 in Right Deltoid w/o complications (lot#: EK9231, exp. 04/30/2021)

                                                pain in right groin; difficulty walking; arm soreness; redness on the toe of his left foot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself). An 86-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL1284, expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; it was offered to him and he was in the Phase 1B category. Relevant medical history included ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was diagnosed 10-15 years prior reporting, had a watchman procedure on an unspecified date, and had used a cane to walk before. Concomitant medication included clopidogrel as a blood thinner from 15Jan2021 and ongoing, which he would take for 6 months. The patient previously took apixaban (ELIQUIS). It was reported that he had a watchman procedure and they took him off of apixaban and started him on clopidogrel. In 6 months, he would not have to take any blood thinners and would make an appointment with his physician. On 18Jan2021, at noon, the patient was experiencing pain in his right groin. As the day progressed it got worse. By night (18Jan2021), he was in extreme pain and had difficulty walking. He had to use a walker to walk. It had let up, but he still had pain in the groin of his right leg. The patient was asking if there were certain doctors that could assist him with this problem. He was no longer using a walker. He was using a cane instead. He used a cane to walk with before this, but not for this reason. He never had any real serious aching. He had a little soreness in his arm on an unspecified date in Jan2021, but nothing out of the ordinary. He didn&#39;t know his arm was sore until he rubbed it. He though it might have been on Sunday when he noticed it. He was not sure. Prior to this, he had redness on the toe of his left foot on an unspecified date in Jan2021. He was prescribed an antibiotic that he was still taking. He was unable to provide the name of the antibiotic. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of &#34;difficulty walking and redness on the toe of his left foot. The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient was recovering from the event &#34;pain in right groin,&#34; he was not recovered from the event &#34;difficulty walking,&#34; while the outcome of the events &#34;arm soreness and redness on the toe of his left foot&#34; was unknown.

When he moved around the muscle discomfort was relieved, but would come back when he was not moving his joints.    Around 10 AM, he sat in a hot tub about 45 minutes, then applied body lotion and was relieved.  Neither the itch or muscle aches returned.

A 86-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2, (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL9269), via intramuscular route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Feb2021 14:15 as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included was none. Concomitant medication was not reported. Upon follow-up (16Mar2021): it was reported that, first dose of Pfizer covid-19 was shot on an unspecified date at 14;15 PM via intramuscular route of administration in right arm of Batch/Lot number: EL9269. She said her husband&#39;s arm has been sore for 8 days. Her husband&#39;s arm has been sore for 8 days was reported as worsened. She said her husband tried Advil, Tylenol, hot packs, cold packs, and nothing seems to help his sore arm, and pain was in his right (dominant) arm, the pain was more in his right elbow and right shoulder, and her husband&#39;s pain is more like a joint pain. She said her husband has a high tolerance for pain, and normally doesn&#39;t take anything for pain. She said her husband can&#39;t put his jacket on because he is unable to lift his arm due to the pain in his right elbow and right shoulder. She said her husband has been trying everything, and nothing seems to help his right elbow and right shoulder pain much. Clarified her husband&#39;s right arm pain started with the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site and then the pain moved into his right shoulder and then into his right elbow. Reported her husband had a CAT scan of his head and neck on 01Feb2021 checking for blood clots. She said the results of the Head and Neck CAT (Computerised tomogram) Scan were normal. Reported her husband&#39;s second COVID-19 Vaccine dose is scheduled for 24Feb2021. The reporter classified the event husband is experiencing a sore arm and husband&#39;s arm has been sore as worsened as disability and other events was not reported and assessed the causality between the event husband is experiencing a sore arm and husband&#39;s arm has been sore as worsened the vaccines as Related. Upon follow-up, it was reported that, the patient has a very sore arm for about 8 days but then it resolved and no trouble since then. His second shot did not have much of a reaction and both are fine now. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of husband is experiencing a sore arm and husband&#39;s arm has been sore as worsened and included treatment with ADVIL at a dose of 200 mg (Lot Number: W36210, Expiration Date: Nov2019), TYLENOL, at a dose of 500mg, hot packs and old packs. Upon follow-up (16Mar2021), the outcome for the events were recovered on 11Feb2021.  Follow up (16Mar2021): This is a follow-up spontaneous report received from a contactable nurse includes, updated information about the first dose of Pfizer vaccine, route of administration for the second vaccine and the outcome for the events.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering temporal relationship and known safety profile, the reported pain in arm was likely causally related to the vaccination with BNT162B2. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The first doze made him tired and got back pain. Went to his Primary Doctor to see if it is okay to get the second dose. He got his blood work done, echo Cardiogram and all the necessary test have been done and he is okay to proceed by his Doctor. On the fourth day after he get the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTEch, in the afternoon, he couldn&#39;t get up from his bed that he had lay down. He experienced slur, facial droop and left side hand weekness. We called the paramedics right away and they checked him and took him to the nearest Emergency Hospital. They ran tests, did CT scan and diagnosed him with Ischemic Stroke on his right side which has effect on the left side of his body for facial droop and weekness and not being able to get up. He was threated with Mechanical Thromboctomy to remove the blood clot. He stayed in the hospital for 8 days and is bed bound up until now and is transferred to a re-hab. He still can&#39;t stand. Today is the 27th day since the adverse reaction started. His left hand has improved a little bit.

An 87-years-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL3249, intramuscular on left arm on 13Jan2021 (Time the vaccination was given: 13:00-13:15) at the age of  87-years-old at single dose for prevention because of age group.  Medical history included covid-19 in Jun2020, forgetful from an unknown date, he got a little forgetful sometimes, so he may have forgotten to tell her.  This occurred prior to getting the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Family medical history was none. The patient got the Pfizer COVID vaccine last week on 13Jan2021, he was really sick in Jan2021. The patient had weak legs anyway, but he got so weak.  Weakness in legs started at night on 13Jan2021, around 20:00. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office required. He never complained of any symptoms and did not know if there were other symptoms, because he did not complain.  He fell on Thursday night on 14Jan2021. He got the vaccine around 1:00-1:15pm, and got so weak, that he went to the bathroom and he fell in the floor.  His legs just continued to get worse.  It started on Wednesday night on 13Jan2021.  He could not walk in Jan2021.  Thursday was the worst. By Friday, it started to get better.  He did not get hospitalized.  He could not get up without help. The patient had Covid 19 in Jun2020. He had a lot of symptoms after receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The reporter reported her father fell in the bathroom while brushing his teeth and her brother had to come over to get him up. The reporter was starting to wonder if he should take the second dose. The outcome of the events Weakness in legs and fell was resolving and of the other events was unknown. The reporter considered event Weakness in legs was serious due to medically significant and disabling; considered event fall was serious due to medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of the events muscular weakness, fall and gait disturbance cannot be excluded. The events are confounded by the elderly patient&#39;s underlying conditions. The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 88-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER9231), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure high, diabetic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he had started no new medications and not had any other recent vaccinations. He took a lot of medications for a lot of things. He was diabetic, had high blood pressure, COPD, a variety of things get over the years, he took medication for these things. He was affected by medications more than most people. No further details provided about his medications. He reacted to medications in general and that because of that he usually took lower dosages. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After 2 weeks from the vaccine. Have weakness and stomach pains and diarrhea. The patient had been artificially sick like 4-5 days since 21Jan2021, and had a test done and it didn&#39;t show up. He said he hadn&#39;t been anywhere to get the virus. He said he didn&#39;t have any fever, his oxygen level hadn&#39;t changed, he had a testing kit with thermometers, so he knew he never had a fever, but he got chills. He got all the symptoms, the stomach problems, diarrhea, back problems, overall weakness and low energy. He was fine two weeks before this, this started almost two weeks to the day and minute from when he went and got the shot. When he got the shot he had nothing, he waited 15-20 minutes with no problems, his arm was hurting for a couple days, but there was nothing else. Two weeks later he got basically an artificial case and the corona virus test said no, clarified to being negative, but he said it didn&#39;t go away, it had been from Thursday to Monday, so 5 days. The big problem was he was supposed to get his second shot Friday, and he had an appointment Wednesday, he would like to ask them too, but he would like to know was it dangerous for him to get the second shot. He didn&#39;t think he can get any sicker. He did not do a report online, he tried to get onto the website but nothing told him how to do it or whatever, so he stayed on the line waiting to talk to someone. Height: he was five feet and nine and three quarters inches tall, he had shrunk with age, everyone got smaller. His arm was not sore for very much, he didn&#39;t remember how long, he got sick two weeks later, and now he was really not well, though he was better than he was on Thursday or Friday, though he was not 100% yet. He would like to know if he should get the second shot, because he was too old to die from a corona virus shot. Investigations: He didn&#39;t know which COVID test they used, they did an instant test with results in an hour. The patient inquiry if he should get the second shot since he had had this artificial sickness for 5-7 days, two weeks after getting the vaccine. He had &#34;sore arm for a couple of days&#34; after the 1st injection, but &#34;nothing more&#34;. However, in the last 4-5 days, he&#39;s been feeling &#34;miserable&#34;. He didn&#39;t have fever. But he&#39;s been experiencing aching, diarrhea, upset stomach, lost weights and nasal drip. He tested negative to the COVID virus. He has a doctor&#39;s appointment scheduled this Wednesday. The outcome of events was unknown.
