A 76-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history reported as none. Family history included wife who passed away 2.5 years before, on an unspecified date and his daughter and her (daughter) son, who lives with the patient, tested positive for COVID virus. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced little bit of fever, allergies, and feeling unwell, but described as not horribly bad. Patient stated he is ok and doesn&#39;t think it has anything to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. He stated that he thinks it is just allergies due to the pollen. Patient was taking two to three Ibuprofen once or twice a day when he goes to sleep. He has been perspiring quite a bit at night, which he stated was ok. Aside from that he was pretty much ok. He doesn&#39;t get second dose until 15Feb2021. Stated we have come a long way from beginnings of time where people would just die. He asked if he should get tested. Patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician. He stated his symptoms began in the evening of 16Jan2021 at 8pm. He started getting a little feverish and sluggish. He took three Ibuprofen. He thought he lost some weight with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Weight was between 169-170lbs on 16Jan2021. The patient operates a daycare center with children. He was not taking any medication except for the Ibuprofen. He is very active and runs a business. Only thing is, he is sad because he does not have his wife with him. He stated everything was fine. He wanted to know if it was possible one can get the COVID virus even with the injection. He asked about the second COVID-19 Vaccine and what does the first dose do. Treatment included ibuprofen for little bit of fever, sluggish, and Feeling unwell. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of fever, sluggish, weight decreased, night sweats and feeling unwell  due to temporal relationship  Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject drug contributed to the event of pollen allergy, which likely represent intercurrent medical condition.  There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.

Also both my arms are stiff and i have some pain. I got the injection on the Left arm but the Right arm feels the same. I spoke with my doctor he told me to put bacitracin on it for few days but it&#39;s still there. It&#39;s less itchy but the red dot is still there its 2-3 inches from the injection site and also said, I think I&#39;m going to skip the second dose. A red sore developed under the band aid that was applied to cover the injection site. It is under the right edge of the band aid. The area where the exact needle penetrated is healed. Both arms are sore at the top by where they meet the shoulder. Outcome of the events were not recovered.

Next morning 3/25, woke up and tried to get out of bed.  Legs were so weak they gave out and I fell out of bed on the floor.   I had no strength to get back up to get on the bed.  My wife could not lift me, so she called 911 for a &#34;lift assist&#34;.  Paramedics were told I received the 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine the day before, so they picked me up off of the floor and put me back in bed.  They took my vitals - blood pressure was 116/73 and temperature was still 102.6.  Paramedics offered to take me to the hospital but I refused.  Paramedics told my wife that if my breathing became labored, she should get me to the ER or call 911 again.    I was not able to get out of bed the whole day on Thursday 3/25, because I was so weak I could not stand up, and I also had body aches and had to use a urinal because I could not walk to the bathroom.  My wife gave me Tylenol and the fever finally broke late evening of Thursday 3/25 and I started to feel a little bit better.  I had not eaten all day, but my wife made sure I stayed hydrated with water.  On Friday morning 3/26 I was able to sit up on the side of the bed, and I was able to walk with the assistance of a cane to the bathroom.  Extreme fatigue affected me all day Friday, but I did feel better.  Fever did not come back after it broke.  Saturday 3/27 - still experiencing extreme fatigue, but feel better overall.

A 76-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: EL9263) at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was not reported. The patient had two side effects and the second shot would be coming up and he was nervous about what he should do. The main side effect is that they put a band aid on where injection was to protect site. The next morning, he took it off and on the edge of the band aid, there was a red dot about 1/8 to 1/4 inch around. It was itchy like crazy, he did not scratch it. That dot was staying there. The doctor told him not to do anything to it and just put a little bacitracin on it. He did not provide any information for the Bacitracin such as a dose, lot or expiration. The next side effect was both of his arms which was stiff and achy at the top. The injection arm feels exactly like the right, but only the left one got the injection. He would like to know if he should be concerned with second dose or not. The outcome of the events was unknown.

At the time, I only had soreness of the left arm at the injection site and virtually no other symptoms except a mild headache for a few hours.  However, during the month or so between the vaccines and post-vaccine period, I developed pain in both shoulders with moderate-severe rotator cuff symptoms. This was pain in reaching in almost any direction. Also, I began to notice heaviness in both upper legs, front and back, which in a week or so progressed to tiredness and then to achiness, and finally to pain when I would squat, bend over, or get up from a chair. I have  never had either symptom before.

Still urinating every half hour 45 minutes and ongoing. Mouth has been very dry and had a couple of areas where it seems like maybe he had bit his lip or something, maybe when he was sleeping. It was nothing like that in mouth anymore but the mouth is still constantly so dry like dehydrated and no matter how much of fluid he drank that doesn&#39;t seem to help it and what in fact has also caused was on yesterday morning he had been a little constipated on Friday night and then yesterday morning had a severe case of diarrhea. Now he had not had another bowel movement since yesterday morning as no appetite and feeling so lousy, and so tired and fatigued. He had been feeling even much worse since getting the vaccine. He still feels very fatigued, very sore all over, very tired, still have the slight cough and he would say that&#39;s about it. Outcome of events for cough, pain and tiredness was not recovered and for the rest of the events it was unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Past medical history includes a surgical infection in 1979 leading to 3 knee replacements in this knee.  His hardware extends from mid- thigh to his ankle.  On 4/21/21 he required a revision of the total knee (the plastic was replaced)  after flushing out the wound with antibiotic solution.  He is now on oral and IV antibiotics (Rifampin &amp; Vancomycin, respectively).   He is being followed mainly by infectious diseases and ortho, but to my knowledge, this has not been reported by them or his PCP.

                                                joint pain in his big toe on his left foot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself). A 77-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL9262, NDC/UPC number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid (also reported as the left shoulder) on 29Jan2021 at 09:30 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was reported as the public health clinic/veterans administration facility. Relevant medical history included sleep problem. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included promethazine (strength: 25 mg) for sleep problem. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient had the Pfizer COVID vaccine shot on Friday morning, on 29Jan2021, and later that day by the evening, he started to experience some joint pain in his big toe on his left foot and the pain had not changed or gone away since then. The patient assessed the event as non-serious. The adverse event did not require any visit to the physician office or emergency room. The patient further stated that he haven&#39;t done anything. It happened on Friday and it was there the day prior reporting (yesterday), and it was there in the morning at the time of the report, and the patient was just kind of waiting to see if it would get any better. So, he haven&#39;t done anything and was asking what he should do about that. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of joint pain in his big toe on his left foot, which included that the patient took some paracetamol (TYLENOL), but it didn&#39;t really seem to help much, so he didn&#39;t take anymore. The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient was not recovered from the event.

Severe muscle aches, strong joint pain, persistent tiredness, bowel irritation lasted for more than 3 weeks so far. Examined by doctor but no treatment prescribed. Rash in right arm was visible on fourth day, below shoulder where second shot was received. Severe pain in left shoulder on third day, where first vaccine shot was received 3 weeks before second shot. Most symptoms are improved at this time, but still some tiredness and muscle and joint pain.

                                                Following Dose 1,  Right Arm became sore at injection site for 4 days, at which time Right armpit became very tender touch and was swollen about size of silver dollar, approx. 1/2 inch thick.  Soreness at injection site subsided over the next 17 days, but tenderness in armpit only diminished slightly.  Following Dose 2, Right Arm was once again sore at injection site for about 4 days, but tenderness to the right armpit became more pronounced, with swelling increasing to the size of a hockey puck.  Size of swelling was easily visible to the eye.  Armpit became more tender to the touch, and has diminished only slightly in size,, as of this reporting.  Mass remains soft to the feel, but easily defined in size and location.  I have taken OTC pain killers to help with the discomfort.  Will continue to monitor its progress, unless notified otherwise.  Do not anticipate seeing my physician at this point.  Have consulted the Web, and have noted that this is a lesser side effect of this vaccine, if swelling remains localized to the injection site.  Thought I should report this side effect only because of the size of the swelling that occured.

By mid-afternoon had to go to bed and slept for hours. Got up at 9PM and went back to bed at 11PM. Sunday was better, but this AM (Monday) awakened with itchy skin, pins and needles on hands and feet (gone now) and total exhaustion. Had difficulty breathing (better now), can barely lift arms and had to miss work and went back to bed. I am reporting this because I am scheduled for a 2nd shot on the 26th and not certain it&#39;s a good idea.

                                                Awakening  on Saturday, March 13, I saw blood on my pillow and a pee spot on the bed (my first time for either).  I could barely get out of bed (an awkward rollover did it).  My tongue was numb (still is) and raw from the presumed chewing on it.  Walking was slow and painful as all muscles hurt.  If I sneezed or coughed, my back would hurt.  Those last problems are still true. I periodically cough up phlegm and lacking a good place to spit it out, I just swallow it.  I have for the first time in my life been using a walker for stability. Right arm is almost useless due to pain.

On 08Feb2021, the patient&#39;s shoulder got a little sore some hours later after the vaccination but it is about back to normal now; he has to raise his arm straight up to even feel it. Caller stated that he received the first dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine on 08Feb2021 and will not be back in the state for the 21-day dosing schedule. Caller wants to know how long he can go and how long can he wait between shots as he will not be back until 04Mar2021 which is longer than 21 days from his first dose. They advised him he could wait 6 weeks maximum and no more. On or after 08Mar2021, the patient was planning to get the second dose. The outcome of event was recovering.

The pain went away.   Monday night I was extremely sleepey, and when I woke up to go to bed about 11:30 I notice some of the joint pain had came back esp the left arm. 05/04/21 , I noticed the area around the v site on the left arm had a red rash about 3x34&#34; and a knot about the size of a golf ball raised and very hard.   Joints were hurting in L arm, legs, and right arm and wrist.   About 10 AM i took 1 ALEVE and within 2 hours the rash was almost gone on L arm at v site, and the swelling at the v site was also getting smaller.  Took 1 more ALEVE at the time point and I felt fantistic.   Same as today, great day, no pain.

A 77-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 77-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 26Jan2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EL9263) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included penicillin allergy. It&#39;s been 25-30 years ago and he can&#39;t take it. He gets swollen and hives and sick. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received a shingles shot about 5-6 years ago and flu shot Nov2020. The patient experienced soreness in the arm on 26Jan2021, back pain on 30Jan2021, so he thought it was just a pulled muscle on Feb2021, shingles on 15Feb2021. The patient received the first COVID shot on 26Jan2021 and didn&#39;t really have a reaction, but soreness in the arm a couple of days. He then started having back pain and he is a very active person so he didn&#39;t think anything of it. Spouse told him that he needs to see the doctor because she thought he had shingles. They do not know if it&#39;s associated to the COVID shot or not. They need to also cancel his appointment for tomorrow because the doctor does not want him to get his second COVID shot since he is on medication for the shingles. Mentions again, his arm was a little sore, but then 4 days after that he had back pain. He is an exceptionally active person, and excavation construction worker and still works and so he thought it was just a pulled muscle. Then a few days later, pain was awful and area was sensitive to touch and it looked a little swollen and he had nothing else. A couple days later he kept saying it bothered him and it was all the way around to his side. It was fine at first it started with a little rash and so he went to the doctor today and diagnosed with shingles. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of shingles which included valacyclovir (Was given Valacyclovir 1 gram tablet to take three times daily to help the shingles). Adverse events required a visit to Physician Office. The outcome of the event &#34;soreness in the arm&#34; was recovered on 28Jan2021, for Back pain and shingles was not recovered, for &#34;so he thought it was just a pulled muscle&#34; was unknown. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problem with vaccines in past.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 or comirnarty in triggering the onset of Herpes zoster,sorenessin the arm,backpain,pulled muscle cannot be excluded.But also consider.medical history of allergic drug history and other relevant medical history.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

He states these symptoms have maybe gotten a little better, but have been continuing on for 2-3 days now. He is also experiencing perfuse sweating during 13Jan2021night. Right now, he was not experiencing this. Maybe a little bit, but not much. The caller experienced mild tenderness of arm on 12Jan2021: he explained when you press his arm, it hurts a little bit. No events required a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of muscle pain was and perfuse sweating was unknown, of chills, weakness was recovering, of mild tenderness of arm was not recovered. The patient was his own primary doctor. The reporter considered all events as medically significant and he believed these symptoms are related to receiving the vaccine because he stated he was okay before that.   No further information expected. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event muscle pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown. Patient had no further information to provide regarding testing/investigations/lab work, blood work, imaging, x-rays, etc for this report. Outcome of events were reported as unknown.

                                                There was a significant drug interaction with Efudex Cream that I was applying topically to a pre-cancerous 2-cm-diameter lesion on my left shin. On the day of my first Pfizer shot, the Efudex treated lesion was progressing normally from the desquamation (scabbing and shedding of epithelial scales) to the erosion stage (starting to form a shallow 2.5-cm-diameter ulcer). Starting about Saturday 30 January (three days after the first Pfizer shot) and slowly increasing for the next four days, the Efudex-treated ulcer became deeper, the peripheral 12-cm-diameter skin became redder, and the left foot and ankle became increasingly swollen.  My RN-wife and I (a former medical-research physicist) began research andChronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg &amp; foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral. Chronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg &amp; foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral.DVERSE EFFECTS, TREATMENT, AND OUTCOME:  discovered that Efudex should not be given concurrently with any of a long list of immunizations.  This is an Efudex problem that should gain another immunization onto that list. Being within a week of finishing the Efudex regimen, we monitored the Efudex-treatment area and the peripheral area carefully. On Thursday 4 Feb (eight days after the first Pfizer shot), the ulcer began unusual drainage, the 12-cm-diameter peripheral area became inflamed, and swelling of the left ankle and foot increased to almost skin-tight - I can upload photos if you need.  Time for immediate action.  My excellent Dermatologist stopped Efudex and started me on Bactrim by mouth for 10 days, and Gentamicin topical antibiotic on the ulcerated central area and Triamcinolone topical corticosteroid on the peripheral and swollen areas for three weeks.  Good choices.  Improvement was immediate and continued improving for the next three weeks.  By the time of the second Pfizer shot on 24 February, the central area was healing well, in the late-reepithelialization stage (regrowth of epithelial tissue that now formed a completely-covering scar tissue with no oozing), and with all inflammation and swelling completely gone.  After the second Pfizer shot (taken 20 days after stopping Efudex), there were zero adverse effects of any kind. NOTE: There were absolutely zero other adverse effects of any kind throughout the entire series: no chills, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in pulse or blood pressure (120/70 range), loss of taste or smell, sore throat, cough, lung congestion, fatigue, feeling of being unwell, shortness of breath, injection-site swelling or redness, hives, swelling of face, decreased kidney function, or other adverse cardiovascular, neurological or pulmonary effects. There was no additional joint pain above my normal osteoarthritis.  After both shots, I felt a slight normal-range injection-site soreness for the next few hours, but no site swelling, rash, redness, or other problem.  We recommend that this immunization be added to the Efudex  proscribed or warned&#39; list.

Went for a routine physical with my Doctor at 1PM and never made it there.  I had no idea of where I was going or where I had been.  Half hour later I remember being in a store buying lottery tickets and the clerk had to help me in my car. Went to bed for the rest of the day and have been improving little by little each day. Was  very, very tired at first and still a little tired now.

                                                I have developed a very painful region in the left deltoid muscle and the right deltoid muscle is less severe.  It prevents me from lifting my arm(s) higher than the elbow, and significant weakness in the both arms, especially the left.  My kneecaps also have significant weakness and pains and makes standing difficult.  this developed the day after the shot.   I also have significant fatigue all the time since receiving the shots.  The second shot (Right arm) was given March 5th.

                                                Progressive lower extremity weakness with markedly diminished reflex: Per the history it appears that patient has had a progressive course of this problem over the last 1 week.  His symptomatology is mostly consistent with gait ataxia with some lower extremity weakness.  He mentions that his weakness of the lower extremities became more and more pronounced towards the end of the week when he would start trembling in his legs whenever standing for some time.  Although he had some numbness and tingling few days ago but that does not seem to be the predominant symptoms.  There was no preceding symptoms of any viremia prior to this.  Although he has Covid in January, however he did not have cough expectorations upper respiratory infection or any diarrhea in the last 1 month.  He has not been exposed to any new pets or any new medications.  His clinical exam suggest a lower extremity weakness more proximal than distal although there appears to be some sensory sparing.  He has diminished reflexes all over including absent reflexes in his lower extremities and many of the upper extremities.  His imaging study did not show any specific etiology for the cause of his problem.  He does not have any spinal etiology and his exam does not show any upper motor type of involvement.  His spinal fluid shows a high protein with no cells consistent with cytoalbuminogenic dissociation.  So he definitely fits with the diagnosis of acute immune mediated demyelinating polyneuropathy or Guillain-Barré syndrome.  On IVIG therapy.  Overall appears to be some improved however not still able to walk.

MRI cervical 4/18 with: Zones of anterior epidural thickening and enhancement causing ventral flattening of the thecal sac without cord compression or superimposed epidural fluid collection from the C4-5 through the C6-7 disc space levels. Additional zone of edema and enhancement within the prevertebral soft tissues along the anterior margin of the left longus coli musculature from the C2-C5 levels again without superimposed fluid collection. Given history of fever and neck pain is findings could be consistent with epidural cellulitis as well as prevertebral cellulitis. No evidence for superimposed abscess. Recommend correlation to CRP level in white blood cell count with differential. No evidence for displaced fluid or disc space enhancement to suggest concomitant discitis.

                                                difficulty breathing; pneumonia; human immunodeficiency virus; pain in arm, neck and back; pain in arm, neck and back; pain in arm, neck and back; FACILITATED COLLECT   This is a solicited report based on the information received by Pfizer from AbbVie Inc. (MFR Control No. # 21K-163-3841481-00). A non-contactable consumer (patient) reported for himself that a 78-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer, Batch/Lot number was not reported), intramuscular on 12Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization; adalimumab (HUMIRA, Batch/Lot number was not reported, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen), subcutaneous from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, at unknown dose for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced difficulty breathing on an unspecified date, pneumonia in Mar2021, pain in arm, neck and back in Mar2021, human immunodeficiency virus on an unspecified date. The events difficulty breathing and pneumonia were reported as serious per hospitalization, event human immunodeficiency virus was serious per medically significant. The patient took covid-19 vaccine and afterwards had pain in arm, neck and back and could not breathe. He went to emergency room and was hospitalized due to difficulty breathing and was diagnosed with pneumonia. He did not know if this was due to vaccine and would not be taking second vaccine shot per his primary physician. He also had human immunodeficiency virus. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. On 12Mar2021, patient received first dose COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer. The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of events for difficulty breathing was unknown, for other events was resolving. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of Pneumonia, Pain in arm, Human Immunodeficiency virus, Pain in Back and Pain in neck with adalimumab was no reasonable possibility. Causality for all events with COVID-19 vaccine was not reported.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of all events with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.   Information on batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known disease pathophysiology, the  reported event of  Human Immunodeficiency virus , pneumonia  and dyspnea is assessed as not related to suspected product  bnt162b2 vaccine and  the events pneumonia  and dyspnea are more likely due to underlying medical condition of chronic plaque psoriasis. However the reported events of  Pain in extremities ,Pain in Back and Pain in neck is assessed as related due to close temporal association with the suspect product. However, more information is required on date of HIV infection deducted to properly assess the case. The case will be reevaluated should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit-risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I woke up around 2:00am with pain when I inhale.  It feels like pleurisy.  I can feel the pain in my lungs, upper back/shoulders and neck.  I have asbestosis so shortness of breath is always an issue.  The pain is not.  I am assuming it will pass in the next 24 hours or so.

                                                The normal site pain from the needle stab, and several minutes later a sympathetic pain in the right shoulder.  Sounds crazy, but the same thing happened to my sister and one of her friends.  Sometime later after arriving home, I developed chills.  At 10:30 pm I took two extra strength acetaminophen capsules (500 mg, ea.).  That eliminated both the chill and the right shoulder pain by 11:30.  Today, the 18th, I am feeling fine except for the injection site pain.

On about February 19, perhaps in the evening, noted varied perhaps 5 mm discolorations on ankles that in retrospect were probably resolved mild purpuric lesions.  On the same evening, noted very mild tenderness in the calf (soleus muscle) regions bilaterally feeling like mild muscle fatigue.  On February 21 at about 6 AM, before showering, noted bright cherry red lesions on/under skin of both ankles and more severely on the posterior calf of both lower legs above the calf tenderness.  The skin was flat and not tender.  Calf tenderness was slightly worse (though still mild).  Lesions turned purpuric, fading in hours.

Follow up with patient on 2/20/21 F/U with caller - He was advised at ER that he had excessive fluid retention; no other issues were identified.  He was advised to increase his furosemide dose from 20mg twice daily to 40mg twice daily for 5 days.  He continues to feel tired and weak, with slight shortness of breath. Confirmed with caller that his 2 vaccinations were separated by only 14 days.

A 79-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3249, expiration date 31May2021) on his left arm, intramuscular on 21Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing congestive heart failure, ongoing type two diabetes, ongoing hypertension, transient ischemic attack, gout, depression and anxiety.  Concomitant medication included allopurinol for Gout, ongoing spironolactone for Hypertension, buspirone hydrochloride anxiety and depression, ongoing finasteride, ongoing glipizide for type two diabetes, ongoing valsartan for Hypertension, ongoing apixaban for transient ischemic attack, ongoing doxazosin mesylate for Hypertension, ongoing loperamide, ongoing vitamin d3, ongoing pravastatin sodium, ongoing furosemide for Congestive heart failure and ongoing carvedilol for Hypertension. On Friday afternoon or evening, the patient was having trouble bending his right elbow. When he got up in the morning, his whole elbow 3 to 4 inches either way was swollen a lot and very painful. During the course of the day, it went down his arm and into his right hand. At its height it looked like a surgical glove that gets blown up for kids. It was very painful. Treatment: declines any Outcome: His elbow is still slightly swollen, not much pain at all He puts his glasses on to read the card. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I could not figure out some instructions on a computer program. I had some trouble recognizing a common object in my hand.  Then mild ataxia.  Excessive sleepiness in 2-3 hour intervals.  On 8th day, developed  abdominal pain similar to diverticulitis. And became very constipated. I had forgotten to take the Parnate and missed two doses. I had forgotten to take Metamucil and Miralax. these led to the constipation and abdominal pain.  On advice of psychopharmacologist, I resumed Parnate  and started to feel better.  I resumed laxatives and good effect. Abdominal symptoms abated in two additional days.  I had gone to ER  but seen only informally by my medical friends. After 3 hour, and getting better, I left.   Blood tests were normal.  No exam.   Since 02/27/2021, I have felt perfectly normal.   Recovered.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports, reporting for self. This 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) via unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID virus in Aug2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM and got a reaction around 9 PM. The patient stated a lot of the same symptoms from the COVID virus came back after the vaccine. The first thing was chills, patient took a couple of paracetamol (TYLENOL), and they went away after about a half hour. The patient had a low grade fever 101.9 at 29Jan2021 night to 30Jan2021, and took paracetamol then as well. The patient reported the biggest thing was everything hurt including muscles and head. Patient felt weak, more or less tired with no energy following the vaccination. The symptoms were from 29Jan2021 night until probably 31Jan2021 morning noon, then he started to feel little bit better. The patient hardly miss work, but missed work on 30Jan2021. The patient stated feeling pretty good and pretty much back to normal on 01Feb2021, it did not affect breathing or cough, just fever and feeling lousy. The patient commented that he can relate to COVID because he had had the COVID and for 2 weeks he was like that. He also had the breathing problem with the virus in Aug2020, and he think he had every symptom but did not lose taste or smell. The patient asked if he should take his second dose of vaccine.

                                                About 5 days after the Vaccine shot I noticed that my finger joints were stiff.  I couldn&#39;t make as tight of a fist, especially my right hand.  When I open my right hand my ring finger would hang up and not extend with the others.  It would lock up half way open  and then extend the rest of the way.  The condition has not changed since.  I had my second shot on 02/10/2021 at 2pm.  I didn&#39;t see a doctor about it since it is not critical except for a little lose of dexterity.

A 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 19Jan2021, at single dose, to prevent COVID, at a hospital. Medical history included lung cancer (19-year lung cancer survivor), mild heart attack in 2011, aortic valve replacement in 2013 and a heart issue. Concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included influenza vaccine received on 06Nov2020 for immunization. The patient reported that on he had the first vaccine shot on 19Jan2021 (10 days ago) and on 20Jan2021, when he raised his left arm where the vaccine was given, he felt a twinge of pain where that was, and a kind of numbness, it was nothing that restricts him in any way, but when he exercised in the morning and lifted his arm over his head he felt the twinge of pain, which was something he never experienced with the flu vaccine or any other vaccines. He wondered if it had something to do with this vaccine. He has not treated it, it has not bothered him much. He stated he feels it when he exercises it and swings his left arm, then he feels a bit tightness or a twinge of pain. He says it does not restrict him or cause him to cry out or anything. The patient also reported that he is scheduled for the second dose on 09Feb2021 and stated that he needs to get a dental procedure done on 04Feb2021 and needs to take amoxicillin for it due to past heart issue. The patient wanted to know if it is okay to take amoxicillin and was wondering if this medication will interfere with the second dose. He also asked if he should cancel the dental procedure. The patient mentioned that he had his annual wellness visit on an unspecified date and they did a lipid profile (unknown results) but it was not relevant in his opinion. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 79-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EL8982 and Expiration date not reported), via intramuscular route of administration in the left arm on 28Jan2021 07:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient was not allergic to anything. It was reported that patient was generally in good health in 79. He knows there may be some adverse effects. Last Thursday (on 28Jan2021) he got his first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine and he&#39;s been having muscle pains. The only thing that has happened to him was a lot of muscle pain, quite a bit. Through the day he started to feel the muscle pain and through the night he felt some stuff (referring to the muscle pain), very lightly enough to be a nuisance. States from the waste up he felt drowsiness. The first night he slept some but not much since he could not get in a position where he could sleep very much. The next morning the muscle pain was much more severe, more pronounced on his left-side, which is the side he had the shot, particularly in several areas like right underneath his armpit and between his arm and elbow. By the end of 2nd day, the pain had spread to the right hand and the day after that, it was concentrated on the left arm on the injection site. The next morning the muscle pain went over to the other shoulder and basically spread out all over his upper body. It has since worsened by then. He broke down last night and he took two Advil, and he got a really good night sleep. This morning he got up and the muscle pain gradually came back but not quite a s bad, states maybe the Advil was slowly wearing off. States it was a funny sensation, a lot of them. Patient feels it on the bottom of the side of his rib cage and neck. He was asking how long the muscle pain will go on. He hates to combine anything he will experience from the second dose with what he was currently experiencing. Patients understanding was that the second dose will worse. Patient ask can he take the 2nd dose on his opposite arm (right), he do not want to feel pain on the same side again. He has a card that states when he was supposed to get his second dose. States it hurts, it hurts to turn his head and he cannot drive safely. States his wife got her vaccine two days before him. He puts his glasses on to read the con-tact details from his hcp card. When querying outcome of drowsiness, he reports it occurred a few times off and on and it comes and goes, it does not stay around. Prior to vaccination patient did not take any other vaccines within 4 weeks. The patient experienced he&#39;s been having muscle pains, he felt drowsiness, it hurts to turn his head and he cannot drive safely, muscle pain went over to the other shoulder and basically spread out all over his upper body. The outcome of event was not recovered for myalgia, condition aggravated and unknown for somnolence, impaired driving ability.  Follow-up activities have been completed and no further information is expected.

                                                embolic stroke; blood clot; His major issue was speech and wasn&#39;t able to formulate any words; left sided weakness on his leg; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s daughter). A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Mar2021 11:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single dose (at the age of 79-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included transient ischaemic attack (TIA) from 2019 to an unknown date, mild hypertension, idiopathic neuropathy: in the left leg, started in the beginning of the year from 2019, melanoma removed in the 1970s, enlarged prostate, neuropathy, cholesterol and fluid retention. Ongoing concomitant medications included tamsulosin taken for enlarged prostate; gabapentin taken for neuropathy; candesartan taken for hypertension; pravastatin taken for cholesterol; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); and furosemide (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]) taken for fluid retention. The patient has been taking all of his meds for quite some time, over 5 years. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 09Mar2021 10:30 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient completed the Pfizer COVID vaccine series, the second shot was on 30Mar2021. On 09Apr2021, the patient had an embolic stroke. The patient&#39;s daughter stated that the patient has a history of TIA in 2019 and was concerned. She does not know if it was related. She added it might be that if people have previous risk, there may be some precautions, like to take a full dose of aspirin before, a week before. She sent an e-mail last 05May2021 and hasn&#39;t gotten a response back. The patient went to the ER due to embolic stroke and was in the hospital Friday (09Apr2021) through Wednesday. The patient went to the stroke rehab center for 3 weeks. The daughter clarified that the patient was in the hospital until 14 or 15Apr2021 before being transferred (also reported as 5 or 6 days and in rehab for three weeks). Then was discharged last 06May2021. The patient&#39;s condition seemed to be getting better. His major issue was speech and wasn&#39;t able to formulate any words. He was able to speak now. His rehab would be a lot of neurological rehab and speech therapy. The patient previously had left sided weakness on his leg from some random thing that happened. It didn&#39;t seem to get worse. It really affected his speech and cognition. The patient&#39;s daughter thought that the embolic stroke was related to the Pfizer Covid vaccine and added that thought was in some way but cannot say in what way. She thought that it exacerbated some type of blood clotting. She stated that he never had blood clotting issues before and was the type of person that would take a baby aspirin and get a nose bleed, he was the opposite of a clotter. An MRI in the hospital showed blood clot and stroke. He had blood work but does not know what it showed and presumed he was fine (unknown results). He has never really had any kind of blood work issues and does not know why he was on cholesterol medication. The patient required emergency room visit for embolic stroke. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering a plausible temporal relationship and known product safety profile, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the reported &#34;embolic stroke&#34; cannot be excluded. Previous medical history and Old age is a risk factor for the onset of stroke. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as  part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of  aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review,  as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 80-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: UNKNOWN) via unspecified route in Apr2021 (at the age of 79-years-old) as a single dose for the corona virus, to get rid of it/ it&#39;s supposed to be sure he didn&#39;t get it. Patient had no medical history. There was no relevant family medical history. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the COVID-vaccine. Patient had no adverse events following prior vaccinations. He remembers his first polio shot he got that back in the early 50&#39;s and his second shot was a cube of sugar, called the salt vaccine. Stated he&#39;s been getting vaccines for a long time and he never had any trouble with any of them. The patient previously received the initial dose of the BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) in 2021 (March or April) in the left arm which was deemed invalid by the vaccination provider due to temperature related issues (i.e wasn&#39;t cold enough). He explained he received a letter informing him of this incident and recommending a replacement dose (which he thinks was on 06Apr2021). About 2 to 3 weeks before he got his first COVID shot, he got a flu shot in his left arm, about 4 or 5 inches above where he got his COVID shot. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not specified. He reported that the second vaccine (BNT162b2) caused him problems. On 06May2021, he woke up with his right wrist twice as thick as his left one, it was swollen real bad. The right wrist was quite sore and painful. He didn&#39;t know if he was getting carpal tunnel or what it was, so he went to the ER about it and they gave him three different kinds of pills, two of which included tramadol 50mg one every day and ibuprofen 400 mg. The ER couldn&#39;t determine the cause for his reaction. About 3-4 days after taking the prescribed medication, his reaction subsided quite a bit and was not nearly as hurtful, but his left wrist then started swelling and being painful/sore. Therefore, he continued to take his medication and it improved. It was like that for a couple/ three days, and it calmed down. He thought he was okay 2-3 days ago, but this morning (14May2021), his right shoulder was swollen and pretty sore and was getting worse; he was in so much pain, so sore he could hardly even move his arm, he couldn&#39;t pick it up straight in the air, couldn&#39;t get his elbow up past his ear. The patient also reported that when he got off his bed, his left knee was sore and it felt like a fire underneath his kneecap and he was having trouble walking. The left knee was swollen real bad and was hotter than a firecracker. Thus, he went back to taking his pill again. The knee pain started the morning  of 14May2021 about the same time it seemed and has worsened, and he took a 400mg ibuprofen and the other pill he&#39;s taking, &#34;100 mg doxycycline or something&#34;. Patient hadn&#39;t been doing much since, he was feeling kind of laid up, he had thought it was all done with yesterday (13May2021). He stated he&#39;s been hearing things about allergic reactions to this COVID shot, was sure that a lot of people are having complaints of allergic reactions, and was sure he&#39;s not the only one who has had a problem like this. He asked if there was anything he can take to block it because he is sure when this calms down after a week or whatever, it will be his in his right knee or left shoulder or wrists or ankles and he&#39;s 100% it&#39;s about that COVID shot. He stated he&#39;s never had arthritis before. He stated that he has never had any problems like this before. He is supposed to go see his doctor in a week or two. He tried to call the doctor to make an appointment, but he figured he would wait a couple days, but he is hurting bad today (14May2021), and he hasn&#39;t been to anybody yet except for the ER. The patient stated it looks like the vaccine is methodically causing this spread into his body. He also reported that it feels warm outside of his left wrist, towards the edge of it and all the way to the joint of the little finger and he thinks the swelling will start again. He expressed feeling anxious about his reactions. He asked if there were any kinds of pills he could take to block the effects of the vaccine from working in his body. He stated it seems like it&#39;s going from one area to the next and it seems like it&#39;s going through his joints and he doesn&#39;t like that. His left wrist still got a little bit of soreness in the back near the joint, but doesn&#39;t appear to be swollen. Regarding the right wrist, he has recovered completely, it feels better; doesn&#39;t feel any soreness in any place and doesn&#39;t look swollen. The clinical outcome of right wrist twice as thick/left wrist started swelling recovered on unspecified date; left wrist painful/sore not recovered; right shoulder is so sore not recovered; left knee was sore not recovered; anxious was unknown; feels &#34;warm&#34; outside of his left wrist/ felt like a fire underneath his kneecap was unknown; left knee is swollen not recovered; arm was so sore unknown; carpal tunnel unknown; trouble walking unknown; right shoulder was swollen was not recovered.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2 , was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021551521 same patient/reporter/drug with different AE/time gap.

He started  to have mild muscle pain just before the 2nd vaccine and continued. Few days after the 2nd vaccine, his muscle pain got worse. He went to a pain clinic from 4/5/21 to 4/9/21. He stopped going there because his muscle pain got worse and he could not walk or move. On 4/16, he made an appointment to see Dr. (orthopedic) and Dr. could not see anything wrong with the X-ray. Dr. said he had a similar case with other patients and pain shots will not fix it. Pt saw PCP (his main doctor) on 6/7/21 and told him he still has muscle pain with muscle spasm and he cannot move or walk. PCP told him to  exercise. Pt is still in serious muscle pain and he is homebound from 4/9/21 to now.  He cannot walk or move. His symptoms have not improved at all. We do not know what to do because his muscle pain won?t go away for about 4 months now.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

By 3/1, I also had thigh and buttock ache with effort and left TMJ pain. On 3/2, I saw Dr. My sed rate was 24. She made a diagnosis of probable PMR and prescribed prednisone. After I single dose, my symptoms almost magically abated and I was almost normal. On 3/11, the only residual symptom with soreness with with extreme neck rotation. On clinical grounds, this confirms the diagnosis of PMR. I assume treatment will continue for several weeks.

This happened  again at 5 a.m.and 7 a.m. when he awakened to urinate. He called his doctor that morning who advised him to go to the ER to rule out a stroke. He was admitted overnight for observation. A CT scan of the head was negative for stroke. He had a follow up MRI head which was also negative for stroke. He will follow up with his neurologist.

                                                79 yo woman received Pfizer Covid vaccine #1 on 2/23/21. She has been experiencing diffuse body pain-especially her hands. Patient had a ground level fall requiring sutures for a head lac on 1/25/21. The diffuse body aches and pains seem to pre-date the vaccine. Certainly, vaccine related reactions such as myalgias can be expected from the vaccine and may have exacerbated her symptoms. MD recommended, based on the above, for patient to receive the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine. However, patient can be reassured that she can safely get the second covid vaccine to finish her immunization. She may take pain medication as needed after the vaccine is given to relieve pain.

The next day I developed aches in lower extremities.  The third day, I went to the emergency room and was given a muscle relaxer. This has not relieved the pain.  The pain has now moved into my ankle joints and it is very painful to walk.  I visited my doctor on the seventh day and was given a pain killer, Meloxicam (15mg), and this is relieving some of the pain when I walk.

                                                At some time after the vaccines were given I started having muscle aches and pains throughout my body.  Thighs, calves, butt, hips, biceps, forearms, and inside area between bicep and lower arm (opposite side of elbow) which would keep me awake at night due to the pain.  That pain was only at night, the other pains were during the day and most times would last the whole day, but other times would lessen as the day went on.  I still cannot sleep on my left side, due to hip and arm pain, but the very painful left arm pain persists as described above even when sleeping on my right side.  I still have these pains as of the date of this writing, April 17, 2021.

He then was having difficulty walking for a couple of weeks. The leg pain was not constant, but he did fatigue easily with walking.  On 3/11 he had his lower dentures placed and that evening/early morning of 3/12 he apparently fell. Patient does not remember anything about the fall - he cannot recall when he fell, how he fell, or any of his symptoms leading up to the fall.  Patient remembers being on the floor and attempting to get up but was too weak. He has rug burns on his forearms from attempting to get up.  He was hospitalized on 3/13 for dehydration, traumatic rhabdomyolysis, and w/u following fall.  Despite very stable labs prior to 1st dose of vaccination on 2/5/21, following vaccination he has had significant and substained leukocytosis as well as transfusion dependent anemia that has not resolved at the time of the reporting (5/13/21).  He remains at a skilled nursing facility due to debility.

A 80-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection,Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included bypass surgery. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Jan2021, the patient experienced headache, minor aches, had a cough, muscles were tightening, could hardly walk, lethargic, chills and heart attack on an unspecified date. Caller states that on 14Jan2021 she and her husband had the 1st Pfizer vaccine dose. 2nd dose was scheduled on 04Feb2021. Caller reporter that 2 days after the 1st dose, her husband&#39;s muscles were tightening, could hardly walk, had a cough, was lethargic, had chills and was c/o having reflux in his chest. Caller stated they had appointments that day with their Internist and their Cardiologist. Both HCPs felt all his symptoms were probably from the vaccine. That night she took him to the ER and he had had a heart attack. They did a cardiac Cath and had one of two stents put in. His kidneys were compromised and the HCP couldn&#39;t give the amount of dye needed to add another stent. So he still needs another stent. Also the blood count went down. Caller states her husband had cardiac bypass surgery years ago. The caller also mentioned her son is a surgeon and had bad flu like symptoms after second shot and only had a headache and minor aches after the first dose. She was concerned about her husband as he had a heart attack and if he should get the 2nd dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood count: went down. Outcome of the events were unknown.  Upon follow-up on 16Apr2021: This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

Treatment team COVID-19 Principal problem Chronic anticoagulation  Persistent atrial fibrillation (CMS/HCC)  COVID-19  Confusion  Hypoxemia Hospital Course: In his hospital stay we managed his medical issues as follows;   Confusion/Syncope in the setting of COVID-19 infection Chronic atrial fibrillation/sinus node dysfunction Hypertension Prediabetes Patient received first dose of vaccination on 3/16 and afterwards started having muscle aches and body pains, later on found out to be having Covid 19&#43; test, he might be having Covid infection before vaccination as well and symptoms showed with vaccination.  On 3/24 he was found out to be having confusion, family called EMS.  They tried to debride patient on his feet and he collapsed for about 10 seconds.  He did mention that he usually get dizziness/lightheadedness upon standing from bed.  Although patient has a history of A. fib but remained rate controlled during hospital stay, we held his antihypertensives including HCTZ and ARBwhile continued his Eliquis.  I believe his syncope was likely due to dehydration with decreased oral intake in the setting of acute illness with COVID-19 symptoms. Before discharge is blood pressure was rising so his ARB were restarted while decision regarding HCTZ will be made by primary care physician. In regard to his COVID-19 infection, initially was started on 2 L of supplemental oxygen but his oxygen demand decreased rapidly and most of the time he remained room air, he was not showing any dyspnea, cough, fever or any other generalized symptoms of Covid 19 infection.  He did get plasma and remdesivir while inpatient, decision was made to discharge him on 3/26 as patient was symptom-free.  He also had received first dose of vaccination. I believe that he would need further remdesivir.  We will continue him on steroids for now after completion of dexamethasone for next 8 days he can recent resume his home medication of prednisone.

A 81 years old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247 or EL3427), via an unspecified route of administration at Arm Left on 21Jan2021 09:33 at the 81 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   The medical history was none. The family medical history was none. The concomitant medications included warfarin from Mar2012 for Atrial fibrillation( AFib) and standard medications . The patient was not feeling well. All occurred on 21Jan2021 18:00, the patient developed symptoms, such as aches all over his body, aches all over with muscles pains with muscle pains, headache, joint pain, chills, injection site pain on left arm, body slightly warm, felt slightly warm, feeling unwell. He had chills all night and could not get warm. The reporter had not taken the patient&#39;s temperature yet. The patient takes regular medications. The patient was on warfarin and standard medications. The reporter stated the vaccine cards were mixed up because they did not write their names on them and the vaccine lot numbers looks like they were mixed up. Someone probably made a mistake because one says EL3247 and the other says EL3427, so she is not sure which it is. The handwriting is different on the cards. There was no Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. There was not Emergency Room Visit or physician&#39;s office required Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event was not recovered.

I also had some scattered, small red bumps over my arms and legs and several tender bumps on my head. The toes on my left foot had a reddish appearance. These symptoms lasted about 5 days and may or may not be related to the vaccination. At my age, random unexplained symptoms are not unusual.

On 16Jan2021 (time provided as 22:00), the patient experienced pain at injection site, muscle pain below injection site, severe bruising below injection site. The patient took apixaban and he believed the injection caused severe bruising. The patient received home remedy: elevated arm applied warm compress, as treatment for the events. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                Patient is a 81 y.o. gentleman with a history of smoldering multiple myeloma, urinary retention for which he self catheterizes twice daily, as well as recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation that presents complaining of increasing weakness and falls.  Patient fell 2/18 pm trying to get out of bed and he took about 20 minutes to get himself to a position where he could pull himself back up.  Again 2/19 he was trying to get up and his legs were too weak to carry him and he fell to the ground.  He needed assistance to get up and family asked him to come to emergency room for evaluation.  He has been feeling poorly for about a month, with poor appetite and has lost about 15 pounds.  He is not nauseated or short of breath and has no cough.  He was apparently treated for UTI about 4 to 6 weeks ago after a visit to urgent care.  He has since been to a different urgent care and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which was new in onset and was referred to a cardiologist who is planning to do a stress test in a few weeks.  I believe he is on Eliquis now.  In ER he was found to have significant pyuria and bacteriuria and was given a dose of Rocephin.  Renal function shows worsening from levels in December although it is pretty stable over the past month from looking through other labs.

                                                Developed watery diarrhea; malaise; weight loss; collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). An 81-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included was none. No covid prior vaccination. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included allopurinol (ALLOPURINOL), losartan potassium (COZAAR), tadalafil (TADALAFIL), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPRIN), simvastatin (ZOCOR). Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 details: (Product= COVID 19) for covid-19 immunisation, Lot number= EL1284, Administration date= 31Dec2020, administration time= 11:00 AM, vaccine location: Left arm, dose number= 1, Developed watery diarrhea about 5 days after the dose. No other vaccine in four weeks. Adverse event: watery diarrhea improved somewhat but worsened again after the second dose of vaccine, along with some malaise and weight loss, since 05Jan2021. Extensive investigations eventually revealed collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies in Jan2021. May well be coincidence, but interested to know if others have been reported.

These were done in in his home state.  I am in a different state.  I saw him last week and he had muscle pain and arthritic symptoms.  Sedimentation rate was elevated.  Started on prednisone with some improvement.

Lower back made it hart to bend over, Rt shoulder had a swelling and hurt at a pinch point in shoulder, my rt hip hurt when I walked more than 0.25 miles, my hands swelled and could not use hand well. Did not initially link to Covid shot, so called my Rheumatologist on the sixth day that the symptoms continued.  Received prescription to reduce muscle  tension and an anti inflamatory.  However, a couple of days after talking to my doctor and before taking any of the prescribed meds, the symptoms went away and since that time, my RA is back to typical old symptoms and pain level.

A 81-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL9261, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 21Jan2021at 12:50 as a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included back pain and arthritis. Concomitant medications include propafenone taking for more 5 year still ongoing for indication atrial fibrillation and dutasteride taking for a year and half still ongoing for indication prostate. No history of all previous immunization with Pfizer vaccine and no prior vaccination in four weeks. On 21Jan2021, received first dose of the vaccine about 2 and a half weeks ago. He stated, it went fine but the day after, on 22jan2021 had some muscle tenderness (local light pain) and stiff neck and shoulder developed that was pretty mild but it was still going. It&#39;s about 2 and a half weeks now. In the morning it was maybe a tad more stiff mostly on left arm, it improved some when walking around and with exercising so he doesn&#39;t have to take medication. He stated, when you don&#39;t move it doesn&#39;t hurt, it&#39;s when you move the neck muscle that it was sore but not much at all. At his age you have back pain and a little arthritis. It was strange that it started the day of or day after. He stated he did report just a bit of local pain but only when you touch the area and a very mild muscle pain, but it has continued and he doesn&#39;t know if it was related. He asked if this was related to the vaccine and how long this typically lasts. Mentioned he has had this pain before but he feels that he has avoided exercise or yoga or anything that would cause it now. he does have arthritis in his back. He was scheduled to receive the second dose of the vaccine on 11Feb2021. He didn&#39;t receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of the events was still unsure if he had this before vaccine or not and its persisting.The outcome of all events were not recovered.

I had had occassional r shoulder pain in the past without a diagnosis or specific  Rx. 2 days before 2nd dose, i b raised upper L ulna. 2 days post 2nd dose, rather severe olecranon pain developed dwith expuisite tenderness and mild swelling, but no fever. Subsequently over a period of days and weeks, I developed worsening right and then left shoulder and some neck pain and some additional hip and other pain. Shoulder tyenderness was diffuse and mostly muscular, Siginficant limitations of ROM withinability to raise arms. Pain was worst at night and on awakening with some relief with acetaminophen (no NSAIDS as on Xarelto).

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right shoulder on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 81-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, stage 3 renal failure (was not bad, was in stage 5 couple of years ago, was a month or so away from full failure, was in the hospital and had dialysis, was able to get reversed with medication and diet), high blood pressure, and blood cholesterol increased/high cholesterol. The reporter stated that with regards to patient&#39;s height, he shrunk a little. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, didn&#39;t get flu shots. Concomitant medications include about 12 other unspecified drugs, takes statins, has high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Patient started experiencing pain behind his left knee about 6 or 7 days later in Mar2021 (also reported as 04 or 05Apr2021, pending clarification). By that Sunday, it had gotten worse. The leg swelled and was also having foot swelling because blood flow wasn&#39;t there. There was no TIA&#39;s no stroke, no heart racing, no sweating, was all pain. Got leg up and kept elevated until they could get to the doctor and get imaging. Patient went Monday 08Mar2021 to see the doctor. Patient was brought to the doctor and was then sent to the imaging place. Radiology read the imaging around 5:15pm on the Monday, 08Mar2021. The radiologist said there was 2.5&#34; blood clot behind the left knee. He had never had a blood clot before. Patient was then sent to the Emergency Room at (Name) Hospital, in (Name) where they live. Was kept there several hours. Did a lot more blood tests. He was immediately put on 10mg ELIQUIS 10mg, once in the morning, and once at night. He is now taking 5mg Eliquis in the morning, and 5mg at night. He has not had any of these problems before the Pfizer shot. The reporter knew that not a lot had been reported. It seemed it should be safe. The correlation and timing having the shot on 23Feb2021 and all of a sudden a week and a half later this happened. It was 10 days later. There was nothing they can do about it. Just continuing with the ELIQUIS, trying to dissolve the blood clot, will be staying on it for 4 to 6 months. It was a pretty big blood clot and were worried about it breaking up and traveling. The patient had no other symptoms, had a sore arm, that was it. Patient going back to (Name) 01Jun2021 and he will have another CT scan or ultra sound when they get back. The reporter did not want to need to get the leg amputated. Patient was only in the ER, was not admitted to the hospital. Patient was concerned because of his age. If it doesn&#39;t dissolve, they know there will be a lot more trouble. The event of pain left knee, blood clot and sore arm required a visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 on 01Apr2021 (lot number: ER8730) in the right arm. The outcome of events was unknown.

Was probably the lymph node.; coughs; very mild sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 81-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm at the age of 81-year-old on 27Mar2021 (Lot Number: EP6955) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cancer from 2018 (started out with BCG treatments, where they insert bacteria into the bladder); Had another form of immunotherapy that didn&#39;t work too well for him and the cancer kept growing chemotherapy; Had a couple of operations and surgeries where the doctor removed it all but it came back. Best reaction was chemotherapy (It stopped the bleeding and was working on the cancer). Last one was 15Feb2021. Was getting blood work for every treatment. Had to miss one of the treatments due to low platelets. Has a chest port for treatments and blood work.  Was very conscious before having chemo. It is kind of a rough thing to kill cancer but also kills good cells too. Definitely worked on killing the cancer for a while; the last treatment was 15Feb2021. Stage 4 was taking chemo. Had bladder cancer (which got out of the bladder and started spreading in to the lymph system), Height: used to be 5&#39;7&#34;, is now maybe 5&#34;4&#34;. The caller remarks that when he started with chemotherapy. he also lost a lot of weight.  Weight: When he went in for last appointment it was 129 or 130 pounds. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took chemotherapy nos from unknown date to 15Feb2021 for cancer. The patient experienced pain in neck and back on 28Mar2021, pain in chest on 29Mar2021. Caller stating that he and his wife had shot number one 27Mar2021 and are scheduled for second shot 20Apr2021. Wife had no symptoms, maybe a bit of a sore arm and he had the same reaction. Was a very mild sore arm in 2021. On day 2 or 3 on the right side of the neck, had felt a little nagging in Mar2021 and slight pain, especially when he moved and felt it around his back. It is just starting to go away now at 3 weeks. Around the back, around the perimeter and when he coughs in Mar2021, he can feel it in his chest. He is scheduled for the second shot. Is wondering if the second shot will have those symptoms. It&#39;s not like it is anything severe, it is just nagging. What worries is him, is that it lasted this long. Is a cancer patient and had last chemotherapy 15Feb2021. His oncologist said to go ahead and take the shot because he really needs the protection. It was asked what if he has the same reaction again. Will go on website but wanted to find out what other people are experiencing and whether or not to take the second shot. Wants to take it for protection. Really wants to take the shot on Tuesday. Pain in neck and back: Only when he coughs, is more of an ache. Started day 2 after vaccine on 28Mar2021. Was like a very dull irritation in the right side of the neck in Mar2021. Was probably the lymph node in Mar2021.  Pain in chest: When he sneezes in Mar2021, there is a sharp pain, all around the perimeter of his chest. Is gone as soon as he stops coughing. Feels when muscles are contracting in Mar2021. Started day 3 after getting the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Stage 4 was taking chemo. Had bladder cancer, which got out of the bladder and started spreading in to the lymph system. Wants to be put on immunotherapy but can&#39;t until he is finished with his shots. If he gets the immunotherapy and if he has a reaction, would have to use steroids and they do not want to do that with the vaccine. The doctor wanted to start him earlier on the immunotherapy but thought it was important to get the vaccine first, that taken care of.  The pain is only sharp if he lifts something. Otherwise, it is just dull. He knows it is there. It is not completely gone. This morning was the best that he had. Really got good sleep last night. The best since it has happened. When he sneezes, he can kind of feel it around his chest, just around the perimeter of the muscles. Treatment: The first couple of days, just put up with it. Took Tylenol one day and then on another day. Takes at bedtime. Does not like taking Tylenol because it effects his liver. If he doesn&#39;t need it, he doesn&#39;t take it. In the last week, every night he has been less and less bothered by how he slept. Last night he didn&#39;t even know he had it, the pain, and slept really well. Have not taken any meds, just Tylenol on day 4 and 5 to help sleep. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of events very mild sore arm, sneezes and feels when muscles are contracting was unknown. The outcome of other events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

The patient stated that I had the vaccine back a week and half ago on 30Dec2020 and was due to get the booster this month and wanted to report severe pain arm for two days. The patient stated that he had many vaccine (Unspecified Vaccine) over the years and have never had anything that hurts so bad after about six hours. The patient just wanted to know that was that normal. Consumer further stated, &#34;I took the vaccine about 10:30 in the morning and about four hours later, it started getting sore but that thing was normal you know some vaccines (Unspecified Vaccine) do that but along with that it started hurting about four hours after the vaccine and it continued to get worse and that night I went to bed and I cannot sleep, it hurts so bad. The patient even have thoughts about getting up and go in to the emergency room. It was the worst pain I have ever had and I could not move my arm. I could not sleep on the right side or on a left side and all I did was take Tylenol as prescribed and that helped a little bit but not much but I did not go to the emergency room, I am not going to do that but I felt like it because it hurts so bad but I made it through the night and next day it continued to hurt really bad. I just keep taking Tylenol every four hours and that continued for two days and then finally I was able to raise my arm up above my head without little pain, it was discomfort, but it was not hurting so bad.&#34; The patient stated that the event started about two hours later it started, it started hurting and then it continued to get worse and worse and it was severe, that is the reason why I am calling that it was severe. I wanted a shot or morphine to relieve myself that how bad it was.&#34; (no clarified further). The patient stated that the vaccine was given in my left arm only about one inch below the top of my shoulder which I think that might have been the problem, I don&#39;t know if you can answer that or not but I have never received the vaccine or shot anywhere near that area, it is always three or four inches down in my muscle, on my arm either on left or right, this was given in my left arm but this was given almost in my joint I am wondering if that would cause pain.&#34; The patient stated it was given only one inch below the tip above shoulder may be that is causing so much pain.&#34; The patient just wanted to report the severe pain, that was for two whole days and then it was subsided and it lasted for four days and I still have uncomfortable feeling in my arm. I was finally able to raise it above my head, my left arm, after two days but it was not comfortable to do it, it was painful.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 82-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient also started to receive mirtazapine (MIRTAZAPINE, 50 mg, Capsule, soft), via an unspecified route of administration, from an unspecified date at 50 mg, once a day for sleep. Medical history included sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], calcium, escitalopram, finasteride, lamotrigine, simvastatin, tamsulosin. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported receiving the Pfizer vaccine in his right arm on 06Feb2021. That evening he took his nightly medication and went to bed at 11:30 pm. He stated he wasn&#39;t able to sleep because he felt like he was in a refrigerator and he was shaking. He had lower back pain, right arm/shoulder pain, and went to the bathroom 5 times (all on an unspecified date in Feb2021), which was not normal for him. The patient added that it was the second dosage of the Pfizer (Covid-19 Vaccine) her received on 06Feb2021. And he had some negative response: a little pain in his shoulder but the worst thing that happened, he went to bed 11:30 did not sleep at all. At 11:30 night, he took his medication (Mirtazapine) and went to bed. He was shaking and he had to put another blanket on himself. Eventually, it was okay, but the problem is he was not able to sleep all night, from 11:30 to 9&#39; O clock this morning (07Feb2021). Consumer stated, &#34;Yesterday my wife and I had the second dose of the Pfizer and I had really strange reaction and I will tell you what it was. Last night at about 11:30 I took my night medicine (later clarified as Mirtazapine), I went to bedroom, I started shaking all over. And the worst part is from 11:30 to 10 o&#39; clock this morning, I was not able to sleep. There is slight pain in my shoulder&#34;. When confirmed if the consumer wanted to report the same or have any questions, consumer stated, &#34;No, we have no problem with temperature is fine, the oxygen is fine. Just I don&#39;t understand why in fact the medication (mirtazapine) is to induce sleeping, use to for sleep within half hour but it didn&#39;t help. I wanted to know what happened. So, this will eventually go away?&#34; The action taken in response to the events for mirtazapine was unknown. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on batch number has been requested.

The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included blood pressure, allergy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), liver genetic deficiency, and had allergy mice, cat, dust and trees. The patient previously took sulphur and aspirin and makes him bleed because his blood was already thin.

An 82-year-old caller received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine yesterday (13Apr2021), around 11:15 am. He added he was monitored for 15 minutes post injection and then used the public transportation to run some errands and return home. He said he received the injection on his left arm had soreness in this arm after vaccination. He explained around 3-3:30 pm he was walking to get the bus and then felt very tired to the point he wanted to sit on the pavement. He also described it as feeling exhausted. He explained he was so tired on the bus that he was falling asleep and almost missed his stop. He said he also began having joint and muscle pain on the bus. He specified he got home around 4 pm and he then experienced tiredness, headaches, muscle and joint pains, hot flashes, chills, and felt nauseous but didn&#39;t vomit. He specified he felt so hot, he had to turn off the heat and remove his clothes, but then he had chills/cold chills and had to turn the heat back on and thought he had a fever. He said around 11 o&#39;clock he had appetite. He added he had cramping all through the night to the point he wanted to cry. He couldn&#39;t sleep. He specified the pain was in his hands, legs, feet, and joints. He also said he felt tired like he had worked for 12,000 hours and was not able to move. He said he had weakness to the point he couldn&#39;t get up to go to the bathroom. He said he had the headaches all through the night. He was feeling unwell, dizzy. He explained he felt like he was going to die; he was worried about his body. He said he still feels tired. They told him he would only have a sore arm, which he did, but everything else was sore too until about 08:00 today (14Apr2021). He explained that he didn&#39;t have all these issues before vaccination. He explained how disappointed he was with his reaction to the vaccine given that he was reluctant to the unapproved vaccine at beginning because he wasn&#39;t the person that take a lot of injection and medications, and so finally after his primary physician to influence him to get the vaccine. He mentioned he lives alone, healthy, vegetarian, never smoked, never took recreational drugs, does acupuncture, and takes little medications. He explained most people and his acupuncture doctor said he shouldn&#39;t get much reaction from the first dose and the reactions to the second dose are more prevalent. He added he was told that people have mainly experienced soreness in their arm after this vaccination with the first dose. He asked if his symptoms were reported after getting the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Everyone told him the first vaccine is a whiz. That it was easy. The second vaccine is the one that have side effects on. He also stated that he almost called to get an ambulance to take him to the hospital. Said that if he had these reactions with the first one, he does not want to take the second vaccine. Sometimes he regret that he have taken it now because he did not expect all of this to happen to him and they just told him that he will have a sore arm on left arm. He was in kind of shock to experience all of this and he was G6PD (Intent: History). He cannot take Sulfur and Aspirin because that makes him bleed because his blood was already thin but that would be no problem also have a liver genetic deficiency (Intent: History). He was allergic to mice, cat, dust and trees (Intent: History). So, he told all what he had that they knew in the beginning they said none of those things will affect. He take B12 (Intent: History) too once a month, he get injection for allergies for his cats and trees and grass once a month but they told him none of the things will affect him. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

This morning, he got up at 6am and his temperature was around 98.8; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9261; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 26Jan2021 at 8:30 to 9 AM, at a single dose, for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history in Mar2020 included had a temperature for 7 days. He tested positive for COVID and it took a while to test negative. At the end of Mar2020 until the first of Apr2020, his temperature was 97 something. He has checked his temperature every day since then. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. He did not receive additional vaccines on the same date bnt162b2 was given. The patient had his first COVID-19 shot yesterday morning about 8:30 or 9:00. He hadn&#39;t really looked at the list of side effects, but yesterday afternoon (26Jan2021), he had slight pain in the arm where the shot was given. If he moved his arm, he would have slight discomfort. The pain was mostly gone today. He also had some slight tenderness in his shoulder, but it&#39;s certainly less than what it was yesterday. He saw other things that were listed including fever. He wanted to know if Pfizer had any information as what to amount of fever people typically experience after having the shot.  Yesterday (unspecified date in Jan2021), his temperature was 97 something. This morning, he got up at 6 am and his temperature was around 98.8. And then he had to take his wife to therapy and when he got back 3 hours later, he took it now and his temperature was 99 degrees.

Seen by GI specialist and had colonoscopy and EGD on 03/29/21 which did not provide answers on sudden stop of bowel movement. Almost a month later still not having bowel movements regularly despite taking Linzess as prescribed, still have abdominal pain and bloating daily, difficulty eating due to bloating and pain, have lost 7 pounds in the past 3 weeks and now remaining in bed more throughout the day due to pain/bloating. Becoming depressed and irritable which was NEVER a problem prior to the 2nd Pfizer covid-19 vaccine.

Following extensive tests to eliminate a heart problem it was determined the pain  may be due to the Covid injection as no other untoward experience had taken place in that arm.  Sunday night the pain was so intense the nursing staff administered  morphine twice to achieve relief. Pain continued Monday and Tuesday, but is somewhat subdued by Tylenol. . Upon palpation of the left arm at singular site invokes extreme pain. The entire arm aches and feels &#34;heavy.&#34;

Uncomplicated alcohol dependence (HCC) 05/05/2021 Yes   Resolved Hospital Problems No resolved problems to display.   CONSULTS: None    INPATIENT PROCEDURES: None   DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY:   PRESENTING PROBLEM: Patient is a 83 y.o. male with Hx of HTN who presents today with complaint of right sided flank pain, with radiations into the right side of his back and right side of his chest. The pain is worse with movement and deep inspiration. He denies palpitations and shortness of breath. He has no previous HX of VTE. He denies fever, chills, cough, nasal congestion, and sore throat. He denies abdominal pain, N/V, and changes in bowel movements. The patient is a limited historian. He is oriented x4 on admission, but states that he has had difficulty with his memory over the past 2-3 years. He lives alone in an apartment.   In the emergency department the patient&#39;s vital signs were stable.  Labs revealed a potassium of 3.3.  AST was 52 and ALT 61. White blood cell count was 11.13.  Troponin was negative and BNP was within normal limits.  Lactic acid was 1.5.  UA showed trace blood.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with PACs.  CTA the thorax abdomen and pelvis showed acute pulmonary emboli involving the segmental subsegmental arteries of the upper and lower lobes.  There is no evidence of heart strain. He was admitted for observation due to severe pain, and was given IV fentanyl.  Echocardiogram showed: The left ventricular ejection fraction is 67%. No regional wall motion abnormalities noted. The right ventricular size, thickness, and function are normal. The estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 36 mmHg. The inferior vena cava was not visualized during the exam. There is no comparison study available.    He was started on Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, than 5 mg bid for total of 3 months.  He should follow up with PCP in 1 week and should check CBC and BMP on 5/10/21. He should also follow up with pulmonologist in 2-3 months.  He had Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 2/18/21 and 3/18/21. There is remote possibility that this PE could be related to COVID-19 vaccine, so this was reported to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). He had mild hypokalemia due to HCTZ, and required K-dur supplement. HCTZ was switched to Maxzide 25/37.5 mg daily. Rechecked K was normal 3.9. BMP should be checked in 1 week. Also he is drinking little bit too much alcohol, 4 alcoholic drinks every night. He was instructed to cut alcohol drinking to &lt;/=2 alcoholic drink a day.  His daughter was updated over the phone.

An 83-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Batch/Lot number and Expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Apr2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure and mild case of COVID-19 both from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included lisinopril taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date was not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced chills, fever, weakness, i had couple of days when i had cough at night and little bit of this and that, I am worrying about the reaction because I didn&#39;t realize that I probably had covid antibodies from the mild case that I had and then the shot hit me, was really bit apprehensive, muscle ache, tired, I had like laryngitis type like my vocal cords were little bit swelled and aches. It was reported that the patient had his first Pfizer shot last week and Monday, he had quite a reaction about four to five hours later and had chills, fever and weakness and so forth. He called one of the pharmacists about it and was asked if he had COVID before. The patient said that he was checked in for that but last month or so and was not checked down but he had couple of days when he had cough at night and little bit of this and that and he suspected that he might have something. The patient had COVID before he got the first shot within 5 or 30 days and that is why he got that reaction when that shot hit him. Now, the patient was concerned about the second shot, like if he will have a problem with that too, he was worrying to go to from about 2 or 3 days for that shot which was scheduled for next Monday,  believed it is 3rd of May. The patient was really bit apprehensive about getting the shot simply because they usually recommend 90 days, in other words, after someone had COVID, to not get vaccination until at least 90 days afterwards. So, he was not sure what to do. The patient took as recommended for the fever, he took Tylenol and it was helpful as far as the aches, muscle ache and all that. Also, he was still very tired and the fever that he got after the shot was only for one day or he got it that night and lasted maybe till the next day and he was sure that it&#39;s going to come down and he will feel better. The weakness that linked, had a cough anyway, was going through this cough a little bit and had muscle ache. He also had like laryngitis type like his vocal cords were little bit swelled but was now getting better and it took like a good week like week and a half and that&#39;s why he was concerned about the second shot. The patient thought what he was hoping to do, was to stop a week or two and give it a little bit of time because he may be close to the 90 day window, it appeared the best way to do that but he thought that it was what the experts should be able to tell him. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test: No- Negative on 23Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events fever, muscle ache and aches included TYLENOL. The outcome of the event I had like laryngitis type like his vocal cords were little bit swelled was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                He believes the trouble started in the wake of his CoViD-19 immunizations (Moderna #1was given on 2/12/2021 and #2 was given on 3/12).  Both shots were given into the left arm.  He reports some soreness at the injection site on the left arm after both shots, but this soreness has persisted with some stiffness and difficulty abducting the arm beyond 90 degrees.  Two weeks after the first shot, his right shoulder started hurting also, worst distal to the glenohumeral fossa without radiation, also aggravated with abduction beyond 90 degrees.  Some soft tissue swelling was noted around the hand.   Simvastatin was discontinued with no improvement in symptoms.  Labs showed a sed rate of 54 mm/hr and C-reactive protein of 46 mg/L.  Blood cultures were drawn which were negative, suggesting no evidence of osteomyelitis flare.  He was started on prednisone 15 mg PO daily on 4/5/2021 with rapid and dramatic improvement in symptoms.  Presumptive diagnosis is polymyalgia rheumatica, but he had no previous history of same, and onset of symptoms was remarkably close to the immunizations.

This consumer (patient&#39;s wife) reported for an 84-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s husband) who received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158) on 10Apr2021 at right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included ongoing high cholesterol diagnosed a long time ago when he was very heavy at one point he was quite heavier than he was. Now he was skin and bones, ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed 10 years ago or longer and ongoing diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago, ongoing pacemaker and ongoing irregular heart beat and falls. The patient previously had sore arms at site after receiving the flu shot for immunization. Ongoing concomitant drugs included Carvedilol for high blood pressure, atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol, amiodarone (this is the medication that would cause an issue with the antibiotic if it was taken orally), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) to thin his blood, sitagliptin phosphate (JANUVIA) for diabetes, vitamin D3, cyanocobalamin (B12), ubidecarenone (CO Q10), sertraline (generic of an old drug called Zoloft) as something to calm him down. The patient was scheduled to get the second vaccine on 01May2021, however he was in the hospital and did not have his. They rescheduled the vaccine for this coming Saturday because he was still in the hospital. He was actually getting moved to a rehabilitation facility with intravenous antibiotics for a urinary tract infection and will not be able to get it. The patient was on an IV antibiotic which could not be administered orally do to the fact he has a pacemaker and irregular heart beat. The doctor told her that the oral medication would interrupt the spikes of the pace maker, his heart.  The reporter was wondering if her husband can still have the COVID vaccine while taking the antibiotic. She asks will it interfere with that medication. Will he have to start all over again with number one of the vaccine because he missed the vaccine in the allotted time span. The last time the patient was weighed he was 155, but he has not been eating since he has been ill. He had so many problems since he has been ill, he has been falling a couple times.  The reporter wanted to protect him from the terrible disease, but didn&#39;t want the injection into his body creating anymore problems than he already has. The doctor said that she thought the caller could take the patient out of the rehab facility for the day and get his vaccine and then bring him back. The facility said they would have to do research about that and get back to her. Caller states that her husband kept falling and had a fracture at the base of his spine, in addition to other problems, he has gout in one knee. She states that he would be standing up talking to her and the next thing she knew he was on the floor. She states that he has fell six times in a month. She states that she has become friends with the fire department because they came out so much. The falling occurred before he got the vaccine. She states he was fine when he went for the first vaccine and then the following week it started all over again, he couldn&#39;t walk. He had a physical therapist helping him strengthen his walking. She states that her husband says he fell and hurt his right knee while working with the physical therapist and the physical therapist said no, no, no, he didn&#39;t fall, he had a strap wrapped around him and the physical therapist caught him before he fell. Caller states that the physical therapist is 30 pounds lighter than her husband and doesn&#39;t know if he could of grabbed him before he hit the floor. She states that her husband was in a lot of pain and his knee swelled up, was very hot. She states that the doctor said it was inflamed. She states that she brought him back to hospital because they could not get him up and he could not walk. She couldn&#39;t pick him up, her son couldn&#39;t pick him up, her daughter couldn&#39;t pick him up and her son and daughter together finally got him up but he couldn&#39;t walk. She states that she called the emergency medical team. They said he has to go to the hospital and that was the last time he was at home. Has a walker and it takes a little while. She didn&#39;t know if he got the gout from that knee, but when they took out his fluid the following day you could of heard him screaming in the next county over. They were suppose to have the results but they didn&#39;t, they discharged him from the hospital. She states that he hasn&#39;t been able to come up with a breather of fresh air and feeling better.  Caller states that he was now taking a gout medication at the hospital and that they told her that her husband had a second fracture to lower spine. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 84-years-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 13Feb2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, occasionally rapid heart beat, blood cholesterol abnormal, cardiac operation (9 years ago, macular degeneration (in each eye and puts eyedrops in and occasionally they give him injections). Concomitant medication(s) included atorvastatin (LIPITOR [ATORVASTATIN]; 10mg everyday) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal; estradiol (ESTROGEN; 10mg everyday). The patient did not have any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient reported practically had no symptoms with either shot. After his first dose he had one day where his blood pressure went very low but by the time he talked to his cardiologist it had gone back to normal and was taking pills, it was under control. Yesterday afternoon he experienced pain in his left wrist, which was the same arm that he received his injection, and describes the pain as not too bad. He states that when he uses his wrist in certain positions, the pain &#34;shoots up.&#34; This morning on the lower part of his left arm (&#34;not the top where I got the injection&#34;) he has &#34;slight pain.&#34; He says this morning his upper arm on the underside where he got it on the left side is swollen. He says he would like to know can it be from vaccine, though maybe he could have strained his wrist, it happened yesterday evening, he had wrist pain and swollen under side of his arm where he got the vaccine injected. He says yesterday late afternoon was the first time, it could be something else, it was the same arm this morning he has a little pain to his upper arm that was not on injection side but below, under it. The patient did not received any treatment, it was not serious pain, it was low level pain, when he uses his wrist and turns it, it comes in more prominent. He says it was not pain that bothers him, if it was not related to the vaccine then he most likely strained his arm.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                groin started to hurt; tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 85-years-old male patient (reporter&#39;s grandfather) received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL9262, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 01Feb2021 (at 85 years of age) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. On 01Feb2021 the patient felt great; on 02Feb2021 he felt ok but was tired; on 03Feb2021 his groin started to hurt, it hurt even to touch it, his leg started to bother him from his groin down and then was unable to be touched; the reporter asked if that could be swollen lymph nodes from the vaccine. At 3 o&#39;clock the patient rushed to the hospital and, on 04Feb2021, he was admitted to hospital due to pain in groin. They thought he had broken something but that was ruled out. The patient underwent an X-ray of his leg and labs. He does not have any infection. At the time of the report the patient was still in hospital and the events &#34;groin started to hurt&#34; had not resolved yet and outcome of the event &#34;tired&#34; was unknown.

                                                I experience muscle pain in my upper back muscles, both sides.  When I moved my head, I felp sharp stabbing pains which made me shout. I could not sleep much on March 8 evening. The pain persisted all day Tuesday March 9, 2021.  I called my ortho doctor and made a morning appointment for March 10, 2021 at 8:15am. I did not sleep much on evening of March 9. On Wednesday March 10 I went to the doctor. On this morning, the upper back muscles were OK, and the pain and spasms wer now in the neck. I could hardly move my head up or down and left and right. Dr. perscribed Methylprednazolone (4mg, 6-5-4-3-2-1 doses) and cyclobenzaprine 5mg (3x daily).  after 1 day and 1 dose, I feel I can movemy head a little farther without the stabbing pain.

Hand x-ray did not show signs of fracture, head CT did not show any signs of new strokes, and labs showed mild BNP elevation. Per ED note, &#34;Based on the patient history, physical, and initial vital signs - the patient&#39;s initial presentation is concerning for heart failure/volume overload-&gt;pulmonary edema and bilateral pedal edema.&#34; He received ipratropium neb x1 and returned to facility. Neurology consulted (12/22/20), &#34;It is difficult to determine whether the patient has a new facial palsy or whether this is recrudescence of his previous stroke deficits. Given the swelling of his left face it is quite possible that there is inflammation causing some partial left facial nerve dysfunction that would not include the forehead. The pattern of weakness is, however, also consistent with what would be expected from his documented right MCA stroke. At this point it is appropriate to consider this a possible complication of his vaccination (Bell&#39;s palsy has been reported in some after Covid19 vaccination). However, I would not recommend any specific treatment for the facial weakness as the etiology is still somewhat unclear.&#34; Patient admitted to hospital 1/2/21-1/8/21 for mild hypothermia with possible AMS and found to have adenovirus. Head CT negative for CVA. Sepsis/toxic/metabolic w/u was unrevealing. Given IVF for diarrhea; C diff negative. Discharged to facility. Patient received 2nd COVID-19 pfizer vaccine on 1/13/21 in Right Deltoid w/o complications (lot#: EK9231, exp. 04/30/2021)

An 86-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL1284, expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; it was offered to him and he was in the Phase 1B category. Relevant medical history included ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was diagnosed 10-15 years prior reporting, had a watchman procedure on an unspecified date, and had used a cane to walk before. Concomitant medication included clopidogrel as a blood thinner from 15Jan2021 and ongoing, which he would take for 6 months. The patient previously took apixaban (ELIQUIS). It was reported that he had a watchman procedure and they took him off of apixaban and started him on clopidogrel. In 6 months, he would not have to take any blood thinners and would make an appointment with his physician. On 18Jan2021, at noon, the patient was experiencing pain in his right groin. As the day progressed it got worse. By night (18Jan2021), he was in extreme pain and had difficulty walking. He had to use a walker to walk. It had let up, but he still had pain in the groin of his right leg. The patient was asking if there were certain doctors that could assist him with this problem. He was no longer using a walker. He was using a cane instead. He used a cane to walk with before this, but not for this reason. He never had any real serious aching. He had a little soreness in his arm on an unspecified date in Jan2021, but nothing out of the ordinary. He didn&#39;t know his arm was sore until he rubbed it. He though it might have been on Sunday when he noticed it. He was not sure. Prior to this, he had redness on the toe of his left foot on an unspecified date in Jan2021. He was prescribed an antibiotic that he was still taking. He was unable to provide the name of the antibiotic. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of &#34;difficulty walking and redness on the toe of his left foot. The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient was recovering from the event &#34;pain in right groin,&#34; he was not recovered from the event &#34;difficulty walking,&#34; while the outcome of the events &#34;arm soreness and redness on the toe of his left foot&#34; was unknown.

When he moved around the muscle discomfort was relieved, but would come back when he was not moving his joints.    Around 10 AM, he sat in a hot tub about 45 minutes, then applied body lotion and was relieved.  Neither the itch or muscle aches returned.

An 87-years-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL3249, intramuscular on left arm on 13Jan2021 (Time the vaccination was given: 13:00-13:15) at the age of  87-years-old at single dose for prevention because of age group.  Medical history included covid-19 in Jun2020, forgetful from an unknown date, he got a little forgetful sometimes, so he may have forgotten to tell her.  This occurred prior to getting the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Family medical history was none. The patient got the Pfizer COVID vaccine last week on 13Jan2021, he was really sick in Jan2021. The patient had weak legs anyway, but he got so weak.  Weakness in legs started at night on 13Jan2021, around 20:00. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office required. He never complained of any symptoms and did not know if there were other symptoms, because he did not complain.  He fell on Thursday night on 14Jan2021. He got the vaccine around 1:00-1:15pm, and got so weak, that he went to the bathroom and he fell in the floor.  His legs just continued to get worse.  It started on Wednesday night on 13Jan2021.  He could not walk in Jan2021.  Thursday was the worst. By Friday, it started to get better.  He did not get hospitalized.  He could not get up without help. The patient had Covid 19 in Jun2020. He had a lot of symptoms after receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The reporter reported her father fell in the bathroom while brushing his teeth and her brother had to come over to get him up. The reporter was starting to wonder if he should take the second dose. The outcome of the events Weakness in legs and fell was resolving and of the other events was unknown. The reporter considered event Weakness in legs was serious due to medically significant and disabling; considered event fall was serious due to medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of the events muscular weakness, fall and gait disturbance cannot be excluded. The events are confounded by the elderly patient&#39;s underlying conditions. The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Hospital Course:   COVID-19 pneumonia.  The patient was treated with convalescent plasma and IV remdesivir and completed the course.  He was treated initially with IV Decadron which has been transitioned to oral tablets for discharge to complete a 10-day course.   Chronic systolic heart failure.  Coronary artery disease.  Orthostatic hypotension in the setting of chronic hypertension.  The patient does have chronic systolic heart failure with an EF around 20% and is followed closely at the heart failure clinic.  He is chronically prescribed Lasix at 80 mg twice daily, however he did have some episodes of orthostatic hypotension during his hospitalization and has been unable to tolerate other guideline directed medical therapy due to his hypotension.  He is euvolemic at this time.  I have decreased his Lasix dosing to 40 mg twice daily to restart tomorrow morning.  His last dose of the 80 mg of Lasix was yesterday morning.  I do feel that in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased oral intake that he is more at risk for continued hypotension and dehydration aggressive diuresis.  He will remain on aspirin, Plavix, and simvastatin.   Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His last hemoglobin A1c showed good control at 6.3 on 3/3/2021.  His glipizide was held while inpatient.  He was on long-acting Lantus insulin 10 units with stable blood sugars in the hospital.  He was also on correctional lispro insulin.  His glipizide will be resumed upon discharge.

He said he didn&#39;t have any fever, his oxygen level hadn&#39;t changed, he had a testing kit with thermometers, so he knew he never had a fever, but he got chills. He got all the symptoms, the stomach problems, diarrhea, back problems, overall weakness and low energy. He was fine two weeks before this, this started almost two weeks to the day and minute from when he went and got the shot. When he got the shot he had nothing, he waited 15-20 minutes with no problems, his arm was hurting for a couple days, but there was nothing else. Two weeks later he got basically an artificial case and the corona virus test said no, clarified to being negative, but he said it didn&#39;t go away, it had been from Thursday to Monday, so 5 days. The big problem was he was supposed to get his second shot Friday, and he had an appointment Wednesday, he would like to ask them too, but he would like to know was it dangerous for him to get the second shot. He didn&#39;t think he can get any sicker. He did not do a report online, he tried to get onto the website but nothing told him how to do it or whatever, so he stayed on the line waiting to talk to someone. Height: he was five feet and nine and three quarters inches tall, he had shrunk with age, everyone got smaller. His arm was not sore for very much, he didn&#39;t remember how long, he got sick two weeks later, and now he was really not well, though he was better than he was on Thursday or Friday, though he was not 100% yet. He would like to know if he should get the second shot, because he was too old to die from a corona virus shot. Investigations: He didn&#39;t know which COVID test they used, they did an instant test with results in an hour. The patient inquiry if he should get the second shot since he had had this artificial sickness for 5-7 days, two weeks after getting the vaccine. He had &#34;sore arm for a couple of days&#34; after the 1st injection, but &#34;nothing more&#34;. However, in the last 4-5 days, he&#39;s been feeling &#34;miserable&#34;. He didn&#39;t have fever. But he&#39;s been experiencing aching, diarrhea, upset stomach, lost weights and nasal drip. He tested negative to the COVID virus. He has a doctor&#39;s appointment scheduled this Wednesday. The outcome of events was unknown.

An 89-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN5318, NDC number: Unknown, Expiration date: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 09Feb2021 at 10:00 (at the age of 89-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, second dose of immunoglobulins NOS (IMMUNE GLOBULIN, Formulation: Unknown), intravenously from 01Feb2021 at an unknown dose and frequency for CIDP. Patient received IV Immune Globulin within 2 weeks of vaccination. Recent DX and received 2nd IVIG infusion on 01Feb2021. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing CIDP (he was diagnosed with CIDP which was chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The treatment for CIDP was IVIg infusion), hip surgery from 14Dec2020 (he had hip surgery on 14Dec2020. The surgery was at (Hospital name)), Sulfur drugs (allergies to medications, food, or other products: Sulfur drugs, known allergies: Sulfur drugs). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Jan2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID- 19. It was reported that, caller calling on behalf of the patient. She was his wife of 63 years. He has a real problem. It was complicated. His birthday was (DOB) and he would be 90 years old this summer. He had hip surgery on 14Dec2020. The surgery was at (Hospital Name). He was diagnosed with CIDP which was chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The treatment for CIDP was IVIg infusion. He had infusions for five consecutive days on 24Dec, 25Dec, 26Dec, 27Dec, and 28Dec (unspecified year). He wanted to get COVID vaccine. Pfizer does not have a lot of information for people who get IVIg infusions. On 19Jan2021 he got Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine and had no problems. On 01Feb2021 he had IVIg infusion because he has to wait 28 days between infusions. They had checked with the neurologist and they said a week then they changed it to 10 days. The neurologist said to go ahead because it was nine days. On 09Feb2021 he got second COVID vaccine. That was Tuesday. He was feeling great and walked into the place to get it. He was ok. He woke up yesterday and he was aching all over especially where he had the surgical hip revision on 10Feb2021 at 07:00. It was six inches above the knee to the top of the groin. It was a sharp pain. When he tries to lift his leg to walk it was especially sharp. He was trying to call the surgeon, but he was in surgery all day. The neurologist said to call Pfizer for any information about people who get IVIg infusion and have chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and the COVID vaccine. He walked into (Name) which was where he got it and he felt great. He walked out and came home. He has had no falls or nothing. He just came home. It was like a mystery. There was not a whole lot of information from Pfizer for people that get IVIg infusions except it started with seven days and now wait 10 days. She was trying to research it on the computer and it only says vaccines in general. It says there might be problem with vaccinations with infusions and she has read the literature that pertained to that. The article she read was from three years ago. It may just be a real unusual kind of thing that a person would have IVIg and get the COVID vaccine. She has been on hold for an hour. She has medical power of attorney for her husband. He had no problem with the first one at all. On the vaccine card she could not read the person&#39;s handwriting. Waited to do COVID vaccine on 19Jan2021 when he was in skilled nursing facility. He was in the hospital for 18 days and then went to the skilled nursing facility for 12 days. The only thing that was relevant was did the IVIg have an effect with the COVID vaccine because nothing else had changed. That was the only different thing. Morning after - body pain with continued sharp pain in left leg groin area - site of recent hip replacement on 10Feb2021 at 07:00. Morning of 13Feb2021- rash on right leg - calf region. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The action taken with immunoglobulins NOS for the adverse events was unknown. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Follow-up attempts completed. No further information expected.
