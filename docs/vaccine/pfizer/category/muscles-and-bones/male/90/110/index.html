A 90-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 in right arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included none. Patient just took his regular medications. Caller said that he had his vaccine done on 30Dec2020 and two days ago (15Jan2021) he started to get pain in the back of his neck going up towards his head. He has had no other problems. It could be he had been sitting too long from watching TV most of the day. But he wanted to mention this. It started a little bit on Friday 15Jan2021, then a lot on Saturday 16Jan2021, and then today it started to go up towards his head. When he bended down more and moved around it would go away for a while, then come back. He would move it back and fourth and down and up. Then it would feel good. But then if he touched it, he can feel the pain. He thought it would get better. This was his first dose. He will get his second dose on 30Jun2021. Outcome of pain in the back of his neck going up towards his head was not recovered.

A 90-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL5318), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 31Jan2021 12:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood thinner  (doctor basically wants to thin his blood due to his age and so forth) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, the patient mentioned this to his doctor did want him taking the baby aspirin every day of the week but he told his doctor he bled too much and his doctor &#34;well oh okay&#34;. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) as blood thinner, lisinopril, metoprolol succinate and amlodipine besilate. The patient previously took flu vaccine. The patient received his COVID vaccination around 12:30 Sunday afternoon. He felt fine for the next 2 hours and then he started feeling a little sore and so forth. By evening, the patient was sore and aching all over on 31Jan2021. This is the only side effect he had, everything else went fine. He could hardly get out of bed yesterday because he was so sore all over and it was the same today. The patient stated, &#34;I keep shrinking at this age&#34;. The patient found that when he gets out of bed and forces himself to walk around very carefully, it seems to get a little better. Today, the soreness was down in his abdominal area and the base of his spine. The rest has seemed to clear up. The patient confirmed it has improved some. The doctor did a blood test about two weeks ago prior to the vaccine and it came back excellent in Jan2021. The patient wants to know if it is okay to take Advil or something like that to reduce the pain. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A 90-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 16Feb2021 (Lot Number: EL9267) (at age of 90-year-old) as 2ND DOSE SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation, stent placement from 19Jun2020 and ongoing (successful in the descending aorta), and ongoing Heart problems. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, administered in Arm Right on 05Feb2021(Lot: EL9263) (at age of 89-year-old) for covid-19 immunisation. The patient would like to talk to an individual regarding his side effects he has been having since his two COVID vaccinations in Feb 2021. Ten days after the second inoculation on 26Feb2021, he woke in the middle of the night with jaw pain. He was in great pain. The pain went down his left shoulder and back . His wife said that morning that those were signs of heart problems. He does have Atrial Fibrillation, and he had a stent placed 19 Jun 2020. He went to the emergency room where they checked him out for heart problems. He had a clean bill of health. They sent him home, and told him to take Tylenol for the pain. The Tylenol certainly helps. It took whatever number of days for it to subside. It subsided for 2 weeks, but then he developed pain down his right side of his shoulder, and down in his hips. Once again they figured they better get back to the ER. They did EKG and a X-ray.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with his stent. They told him just to continue with Tylenol to control the pain. He went a third time to the emergency room because he was having problems breathing.  The emergency room put him through the COVID entry at Kaiser because of the difficulty breathing. They re did all the previous work, and did a scan of his lung to check for blood clots. He thinks they did that because 6 people died from blood clots from Johnsons and Johnson. They wanted to see if there were blood clots, but there were no blood clots. They told him he needed to make an appointment with his primary who then referred him to a Cardiologist. On 11May2021, he saw his primary doctor who ordered another scan because they found possibly a swollen lymph node on his trachea. The doctor measured that, and said to wait a month to do that again. To see any change in it. On the 26 May 2021, he has his next appointment to get that rechecked. He hasn&#39;t had a comfortable day since this started. He has had pains in different parts of his body that last for 2-3 days and then some place else starts to hurt. His left ankle, right side heel, and shoulders also hurt. The pain  was under control if he takes ibuprofen, but his doctor advised him against too much of that because of his kidneys. It was very effective.  The Tylenol works to some extent, but not like the Ibuprofen. He is just living with it day to day. He can play tennis some days. One day he played tennis and came home with chills. His wife took his temperature and it was 100.3. In the last week and half this has happened two times. After the second shot this has happened probably four times. He has weird fevers for one day with no other symptoms. Ever since 26Feb2021, it has been on a daily basis that some place else hurts. One subsides , but another pain starts up elsewhere. If that is not happening, then his whole demeaner is dead. He is just not comfortable and sitting around he feels like he was wasting what life he has left. He used to be a PE teacher. He has always been in good physical condition. He was 5k and walking 5ks every 4th of Jul. He would compete. He prepared for this 90 birthday/ His goal was to do a 5k in under 60 minutes. He worked out like always , and played tennis 3 days a week to prepare. He also played ball. He likes to walk run 2-3 miles most days. He did his 5k in 52minutes, and he was celebrating. Then ten days later this all started happening. The patient/caller has been tested for COVID, and it was negative. The aches and pains were moving around. He was still having breathing difficulties. Sometimes he can&#39;t talk because of the breathing. It just goes away. If it is something like the tumor or a node on the trachea wouldn&#39;t it be happening all the time? Sometimes he can&#39;t talk because the breathing is bad. It comes and goes. It is more often recently. It is like all the sudden he can&#39;t breath and can&#39;t talk. That started right at the beginning. It has gotten progressively worse. He took Tylenol to help the pain in his body. Nothing has helped his breathing. He tried antihistamines to see if maybe it was hay fever or something , but there was no difference. He didn&#39;t know where to go from here. He was feeling horrible. He was  just waiting on 26 May2021, for the second scan without color of thorax to see those results. The patient said he didn&#39;t have questions. The outcome of events was unknown.

I thought he had broken his hip so I took him to the Orthopedic doctor who x-rayed the hip and said that there was arthritis flaring up causing this problem.  A few days later, the pain was gone but he had developed a problem swallowing and aspirated leading to pneumonia.  Even after the pneumonia was resolved, he was unable to drink or eat.  He was placed on a diet with mush and honey liquid and died a week later.

A 91-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 12Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) at single dose (at the age of 91 years old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included emphysema from smoking, which was diagnosed about 11-12 years ago. He says he doesn&#39;t know if he has got it, his doctor had took some test that come back then he said you have emphysema. He says that it never bothers him, and he doesn&#39;t take oxygen at all. He says he take 8 medicines that he has been taking since he had a heart attack in 1996, they are not new medications. He says he had heart surgery then too.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were unspecified.

It was reported that patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine 9 days ago. However, he said he was still experiencing mild tiredness, weakness, and dizziness. He wants to know if these side effects are still associated to the vaccine and if it is normal that he is still experiencing it 9 days after his 1st dose. He also mentioned that he has no temperature and his pulse and blood pressure was normal. It was then reported that patient was still suffering some side effects 2-1/2 weeks after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said the side effects come and go. He said the side effects will last 4-5 hours, and then go away, and come back the next day. He said he has checked his blood pressure and pulse, and they are both OK. He said he uses an oximeter to check his oxygen level, and his oxygen is good. He said he sleeps well at night. He said he is having periods of dizziness, weakness, and feeling tired and sleepy. He said he feels lightheaded and unstable on his feet, also. He said he feels fine now. He said his right shoulder is bothering him a little, too. He said his right shoulder was uncomfortable and bothered him if he laid on it at night. Reported his back was bothering him, so he bent over a little, but if he stands up straight, he was about 5&#39;10&#34;. He stated his side effects started a day or so after he received his COVID-19 Vaccine, and he can&#39;t remember the exact day. He said the side effects lasted continuously for several days, or about a week. He said now his side effects are sporadic. He said in the morning he will wake up and feel OK, and then after a while the side effects start. He said some days his side effects will start in the morning, and other days his side effects won&#39;t start until the afternoon. Patient declined any treatment. He said he read that any side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine only last 2-3 days. Reporter wants to know if it is a problem that he is still having side effects after 2-1/2 weeks or is there some action he should be taking. He said he figured Pfizer is the expert, so he would ask Pfizer directly. He said otherwise, he was thinking of going to an urgent care to see what the urgent care thinks of his side effects. There was no emergency room or physician office visit. There were no relevant tests. Reported his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was scheduled on 26Feb2021 at 9:30AM and asked if still can get the 2nd dose Vaccine after having a reaction to the 1st dose. No PQC was present.

                                                The vaccine was given on Monday.  Tuesday afternoon he developed weakness in both legs and could not stand up.  This was a new development;  he had neuropathy in one leg but he had been able to stand up and walk three hours before.  He was helped to the bathroom.  He said he felt better and might want to stand up again.  He was helped to bed.  He was found dead around 5:30 Wednesday morning.    He was 94 years old and had a lot of medical conditions.  No one has indicated his death had anything to do with the vaccine.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a coincidence that he died so soon after receiving the vaccine

                                                I received  my first COVID 19 Pfizer Vaccination on Jan. 21, 2021 from clinic about 2:30 pm. I am age 94.  My wife brought me home about 3:30 pm and I was tired and went to bed and to sleep. I slept soundly until about 8 pm, and my wife awoke me to eat.  I was too weak to sit up or stand, my legs felt like rubber.  I didn?t feel like eating, and I couldn?t answer her questions coherently.  My wife was worried and called the 911. They checked me and found my vital signs were normal, so they helped my wife get me settled in bed. The next few days I still felt weak and had to use a cane or walker.  My second dose is scheduled for February 11, 2021 at 2 pm.  Will I likely have worse side affects?  What precautions should I take.

The patient did not see very well; caller had to read some of the information provided in this report from forms that patient was unable to read during report. The muscle pain was marginal. The weakness was the same or worse. He wanted a pain reliver or pill. Patient did not plan to get the second dose due to adverse events. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No emergency room/physician office visit. Family medical history relevant to the events was none.
