                                                91 yo father received vaccine, was mobile and alert before first shot, but required wheelchair by second vaccination due to being weak. After second vaccination, was not able to stand or move after 36 hrs, at which point he was taken to the hospital. At hospital, all vital signs were good except an MRI showed cancer in spine.  Shot was given 3/1 and my father passed on 3/18.  Obviously this shot did not cause metastatic cancer, but I believe it did induce an inflammatory response of some kind that caused it to progress extremely quickly.

A 92-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL92U3) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included different pills. The patient called and would like to know if his sciatic problem in his left side was related to the Covid vaccine he received. After he got his shot he went down and parked for 15 minutes and then he went to ride home, and when he got out of the car he had sciatic nerve going down his leg on 21Jan2021. He can&#39;t seem to get rid of it and now he was just wondering what would have done that. He felt the pain that goes down his right leg/bum down to his foot, he had a tough time walking on 21Jan2021. Patient was taking different pills and stated, &#34;nothing real serious but this is little bit serious&#34;. Treatment for the events: patient tried different saps and stuffs to put on his leg and he had also taken Tylenol arthritis pill. Outcome of the events was unknown.    No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected. Information regarding the lot/batch number has been obtained.

He was at therapy from 12:36 pm until 1:22 pm when he stated he was too tired and could not do anymore. The therapist took him back to his room at that time and he got into bed himself but stated his legs felt heavy. At 1:50 pm the CNA answered his call light and found he had taken himself to the bathroom. She stated that when he went to get back into the bed it was &#34;abnormal&#34; how he was getting into it so she assisted him. At that time he quit breathing and she called a RN into the room immediately. He was found without a pulse, respirations, or blood pressure at 1:54 pm. He was a DNR.

                                                My father was in weak condition to begin with.  He didn&#39;t get out of bed for the next few days after receiving the vaccine.  The little amount that he ate was consumed in bed.  He began aspirating his food which lead to pneumonia.  He wasn&#39;t strong enough to fight off the pneumonia even with antibiotics.   He died on 1/23/21.   While he might have passed soon in any case, I believe that the vaccine may possibly have increased his weakness/exhaustion thereby hastening his demise.

This was a new development;  he had neuropathy in one leg but he had been able to stand up and walk three hours before.  He was helped to the bathroom.  He said he felt better and might want to stand up again.  He was helped to bed.  He was found dead around 5:30 Wednesday morning.    He was 94 years old and had a lot of medical conditions.  No one has indicated his death had anything to do with the vaccine.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a coincidence that he died so soon after receiving the vaccine

A 94-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021 13:45 (at 94-year-old) at single dose (Arm Right) for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type is clinic. Medical history included congestive heart failure, early stages dementia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 on 04Feb2021 (at 93-year-old) on right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient had no covid prior vaccination. Patient has no known allergies. The patient (father) seemed to be doing fine until 19:45 on 26Feb2021 roughly 30 hours after vaccination. He has early stages dementia, so if he was feeling ill he didn&#39;t report anything, and they didn&#39;t notice anything. He got up from the table, notably shuffled the 10 feet to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet before we could &#34;pull down his pants&#34;, and then became non-responsive. The reporter said to her son it looks like he is having a stroke. They got him onto the floor. started him on his oxygen concentrator (usually used only at night), O2 went from 85 to 98; bp 155 from an unspecified date. after a while he came to. he is dnr, dni, so they didn&#39;t call an ambulance. Eventually they got him up. no signs of stroke. He does have congestive heart failure. This has never happened before, and he has no history of falling. Daughter was reporting the next morning. He has not yet been awake since this occurred. it is now 8am 27Feb2021. Covid was not tested post vaccination. The outcome of the event o2 went from 85 to 98 was recovered, while for other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.
