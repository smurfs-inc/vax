Caller said that he had his vaccine done on 30Dec2020 and two days ago (15Jan2021) he started to get pain in the back of his neck going up towards his head. He has had no other problems. It could be he had been sitting too long from watching TV most of the day. But he wanted to mention this. It started a little bit on Friday 15Jan2021, then a lot on Saturday 16Jan2021, and then today it started to go up towards his head. When he bended down more and moved around it would go away for a while, then come back. He would move it back and fourth and down and up. Then it would feel good. But then if he touched it, he can feel the pain. He thought it would get better. This was his first dose. He will get his second dose on 30Jun2021. Outcome of pain in the back of his neck going up towards his head was not recovered.

A 90-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL5318), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 31Jan2021 12:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood thinner  (doctor basically wants to thin his blood due to his age and so forth) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, the patient mentioned this to his doctor did want him taking the baby aspirin every day of the week but he told his doctor he bled too much and his doctor &#34;well oh okay&#34;. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) as blood thinner, lisinopril, metoprolol succinate and amlodipine besilate. The patient previously took flu vaccine. The patient received his COVID vaccination around 12:30 Sunday afternoon. He felt fine for the next 2 hours and then he started feeling a little sore and so forth. By evening, the patient was sore and aching all over on 31Jan2021. This is the only side effect he had, everything else went fine. He could hardly get out of bed yesterday because he was so sore all over and it was the same today. The patient stated, &#34;I keep shrinking at this age&#34;. The patient found that when he gets out of bed and forces himself to walk around very carefully, it seems to get a little better. Today, the soreness was down in his abdominal area and the base of his spine. The rest has seemed to clear up. The patient confirmed it has improved some. The doctor did a blood test about two weeks ago prior to the vaccine and it came back excellent in Jan2021. The patient wants to know if it is okay to take Advil or something like that to reduce the pain. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A 91-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 12Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) at single dose (at the age of 91 years old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included emphysema from smoking, which was diagnosed about 11-12 years ago. He says he doesn&#39;t know if he has got it, his doctor had took some test that come back then he said you have emphysema. He says that it never bothers him, and he doesn&#39;t take oxygen at all. He says he take 8 medicines that he has been taking since he had a heart attack in 1996, they are not new medications. He says he had heart surgery then too.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were unspecified. The patient previously took BNT162B2 on 16Feb2021, dose, 1 (lot number: EN6200) for COVID-19 immunisation; the patient also had flu shot (INFLUENZA VACCINE) for immunisation. On Mar2021, the patient said he has got a big tumor on the side of his neck from it, and he wondered if there is anyone there that can tell him something to put on his neck to make it softer or go down, he has had it 4 weeks since that Friday. He said it was after the second shot that the tumor started, about the second day after it.  He said last night his neck was tight because it stretches so much. He says he has done no treatment. The events were reported as medically significant. The outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Reporter wants to know if it is a problem that he is still having side effects after 2-1/2 weeks or is there some action he should be taking.

                                                The vaccine was given on Monday.  Tuesday afternoon he developed weakness in both legs and could not stand up.  This was a new development;  he had neuropathy in one leg but he had been able to stand up and walk three hours before.  He was helped to the bathroom.  He said he felt better and might want to stand up again.  He was helped to bed.  He was found dead around 5:30 Wednesday morning.    He was 94 years old and had a lot of medical conditions.  No one has indicated his death had anything to do with the vaccine.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a coincidence that he died so soon after receiving the vaccine

                                                I received  my first COVID 19 Pfizer Vaccination on Jan. 21, 2021 from clinic about 2:30 pm. I am age 94.  My wife brought me home about 3:30 pm and I was tired and went to bed and to sleep. I slept soundly until about 8 pm, and my wife awoke me to eat.  I was too weak to sit up or stand, my legs felt like rubber.  I didn?t feel like eating, and I couldn?t answer her questions coherently.  My wife was worried and called the 911. They checked me and found my vital signs were normal, so they helped my wife get me settled in bed. The next few days I still felt weak and had to use a cane or walker.  My second dose is scheduled for February 11, 2021 at 2 pm.  Will I likely have worse side affects?  What precautions should I take.

A 95-year-old male patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine ), via an unspecified route of administration in upper right arm on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for vaccination. Medical history included diabetes from 1950 (also reported as 1991) and ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced not in very good shape/terrible reactions on 16Jan2021 12:00. Requested information regarding events relative to the product. Further clarified this event as to include injection site pain; tiredness; muscle pain; feeling unwell; frequent urination every 15 minutes; signs of severe allergic reaction including dizziness, weakness and sight impairment. Patient clarified that all of these events had onset of about 12:00pm-1 hour after Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered (16Jan2021 12:00) and had for the most part remained the same since onset, but for sight impairment was on 18Jan2021. The patient did not see very well; caller had to read some of the information provided in this report from forms that patient was unable to read during report. The muscle pain was marginal. The weakness was the same or worse. He wanted a pain reliver or pill. Patient did not plan to get the second dose due to adverse events. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No emergency room/physician office visit. Family medical history relevant to the events was none. The outcome of injection site pain was recovered on 18Jan2021, tiredness, feeling unwell, dizziness was not recovered, muscle pain, frequent urination every 15 minutes was recovering, severe allergic reaction, weakness, sight impairment was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.
