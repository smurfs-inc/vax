Patient started to sway and lost muscle control.  I helped to the floor and laid him out.  Patient conscious whole time and never stopped breathing.  Did not lose cognizance.  Had momentary feeling of nausea that immediately passed.  Did not believe necessary to call 9-1-1 as patient did not exhibit any allergy symptoms of any distress during the whole episode.  Allowed to lay on floor for about 5-10 min.  Supplied patient with bottle of water to help with dry mouth and he drank and felt better.  After another 10 minutes patient was up on feet and feltmuch better.  Mother called an hour and a half later (about 5 min ago as I prepare this form) to inform me that he was back to 100%.

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  Patient is a 16 year old boy with ADHD who presented with fever and myalgias for 3 days, that progressed to sharp parasternal chest pain and some SOB. Patient received second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 4/26, and after that shot experienced fever to 102 at home and myalgias. Subsequently his symptoms of chest pain have occurred. He underwent workup revealing of elevated Troponin, and EKG with some ST segment elevation, a slightly elevated CRP at 32, and a normal ECHO. Admitted for observation and concern for infectious myocarditis vs MIS-C. Cardiac MRI was done confirming Myocarditis, Troponin I was elevated and peaked at 23, 325pg/mL. Workup unrevealing of SARS. Other testing showed Resp virus panel negative, blood pcr for EBV, CMV, Parvovirus B19, enterovirus, and adenovirus all negative, HIV antigen/antibody testing negative. Patient treated with Ketorolac with steady improvement in symptoms over several hospital days. Discharged home 5/2 with Troponin I well down and symptoms resolved. Given reports in lay press regarding other cases of COVID-19 MRNA vaccine associated myocarditis, we are reporting this as a vaccine associated adverse event.

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old young man presenting with chest pain admitted for myopericarditis.   He was in his usual state of good health until 2 days ago when he experienced fever, chills and myalgias after receiving his 2nd dose of COVID pfizer vaccine. He improved until 5/2 when he developed a crushing, non-radiating, substernal chest pain which was waxing and waning in nature without specific alleviating factors. He had shortness of breath, but no palpitation, dizziness, or changes in pain on exertion vs rest. Family activated EMS who gave 325 mg of aspirin en route to the ED.   In the ED, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was mildly diaphoretic, but otherwise, unremarkable on physical exam. STAT EKG showed ST elevations in V5 and V6 and ST depressions in V1 and V2 as well as PR depressions, which persisted on repeated EKG. Given concern for myopericarditis, they ordered labs including CBC, CMP, troponin and inflammatory markers which were only remarkable for troponin of 1.94 and CRP 3.5. Chest x-ray was normal.    Cardiology was consulted and they recommended transthoracic echo which is pending. Cards also recommended starting Ibuprofen 600 mg q8 hrs and admission to cards for further management.

                                                My son woke up with a upper backache in the middle of the night (5/3/21) and shortly after that he said that it felt like someone was squeezing his heart.  We called the pediatrician on call who recommended I take him to the ER.  At the ER, they performed two EKG&#39;s, a chest x-ray, bloodwork and an echocardiogram.  We were discharged from the ER 7 1/2 hours later with the following diagnoses: acute chest pain and acute pericarditis.  His treatment consists of taking 600 mg of Advil every eight hours for at least the next, laying low and not exerting himself for the next and following up with his primary care provider and seeing the pediatric cardiologist later this week.

He started experiencing symptoms on 5/6/2021 morning a t06:07 AM.  He received his second dose of  Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 5/4/2021 10:: AM.  In the ED, CBC, CMP and UA was within normal limits. EKG at 20:46  and again at 21:14 showed  ST segment elevation in inferolateral leads with possible myocardial injury, ischemia or pericarditis.  Troponin 0 hour was 835 and at 2 hours 1674.  Patient was admitted to the PICU for further evaluation and management. Echo on 5/6/2021 showed normal LV systolic function with SF 31%  . Cardiac MRI on 5/7 showed contrast enhancement of inferolateral wall consistent with myo-pericarditis with small pericardial effusion.  Troponins were trended every 12 hours and plateaued in the 1800&#39;s on 5/8/2021. Patient was diagnosed with acute myo-pericarditis. Respiratory viral PCR and COVID-19 PCR on 05/06/2021 were negative. Thyroid studies were normal. ANA titer is pending. Viral serology for HbsAg was negative and HIV was non-reactive. Results for additional viral serologies for Coxsackie viruses, EBV, CMV and HHV6 are awaited. Patient was treated with  NSAIDs and Colchicine. IVIG was not given based on clinical judgement. Pediatric Cardiology was involved in patient&#39;s care and clinical decision making. Patient remained hemodynamically stable on room air throughout his PICU course.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable reporter reporting for her son, via Pfizer sponsored program.  A 16-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose at the age of 16-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.   The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  After 24 hours from vaccination, on 25Apr2021, he felt pain on the injection site. For that, the mother gave her son Tylenol to treat the symptoms. Then after 24 hours, on 26Apr2021 he felt fine. However, 2 days after, on 28Apr2021, he felt pain underneath the left side of his armpit, had a fever with a temperature of 102.8 F, and the right side of his neck was swollen. In addition to this, he was experiencing a lot of body aches, headache, and pain on his neck. They already contacted their HCP and prescribed him with antibiotics in Apr2021. He was tired and almost lethargic in Apr2021. Reporter wanted to know if her son should still receive the 2nd dose. The reporter was invited to consult her HCP. The outcome of pain on the injection site was recovering, of all other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events Neck swelling, Armpit pain, and Fever cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 16-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: UNKNOWN) via unspecified route in the left arm on 26May2021 at 10:00 (at the age of 16-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were no concomitant medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. After seconds of injecting the vaccine, on 26May2021 at 10:00, the patient passed out or fainted. His father slightly slapped his face to keep him awake. The patient responded slightly and his face and lips became so pale. His father thought he was okay, then he fainted again and the seizure happened. The father was holding his body and his arm is so hard and straight (on the left arm where the vaccine was injected). His body was shaking, almost fell of the chair. Then they called for emergency assistance from the hospital. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Patient was to schedule a visit to the primary doctor. The clinical outcome of the events passed out or fainted, face and lips became so pale, seizure, arm is so hard and straight, and body was shaking was unknown. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  The lot/batch number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.

                                                Shot given around 1125 am.  Pt and pt&#39;s mother went to sit in front of pharmacy.  At around 1135, pt fell out of chair, sounded/looked like he may have hit his head on blood pressure machine that he was sitting near.  We thought he had fainted.  Pt woke within 10 or so seconds after fall and was confused.  Said his head didn&#39;t hurt.  His skin did lose it&#39;s color and he was looking &#34;white as a sheet&#34;.  We had pt lie on floor and elevated his feet.  After a few minutes he was feeling better and was able to sit in a chair.   Pt and his mom left the pharmacy area about 15-20 minutes after pt fainted.  Upon looking at video of the event,  it appears that before the patient fell out of his chair that his right arm raises up and his elbow is bent in a very stiff way.  A split second later his whole body appears to stiffen and bend to the left, then he falls out of the chair and is lying on the floor.  When on the floor, his legs appear to be fairly stiff as well.  This whole episode seems to last about 10 seconds or less.  The video makes it look more like a seizure than a case of syncope.

                                                17-year-old male who presents with 8 days of headache.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 4/21.  He felt like he had the flu after getting the vaccine and developed right-sided neck pain and a temperature to 100.  The patient did endorse being elbowed in the neck playing basketball during this time as well, as he played in a basketball tournament in right after this.  He got his Covid vaccine in his right deltoid.  He saw his pediatrician on 4/26 and a CT scan of his neck with IV contrast was done and this showed significant diffuse right-sided deep spatial neck edema and right-sided adenopathy.  The pediatrician discussed the findings with ENT who recommended augmentin and a medrol dosepak.  The patient developed a headache several days after this and went to urgent care for evaluation.  There was concern that the augmentin and steroids had caused the headache, so the steroids were stopped and he was switched to keflex on 4/30.  He was given phenergan and toradol at Urgent Care and discharged home.  His mom notes that several days ago he had fevers of 101-104.  He has not had a fever for several days now.  His headache continued and he felt unwell at basketball practice so he returned to urgent care on 5/4.  A CT scan of his head was done which showed right sigmoid and transverse sinus thrombosis as well as thrombophlebitis of the right IJ. He was sent to ED for further management at that time.  In the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable and well-appearing.  The CTs were overread by our radiologists here.  The patient had some labs done at the outside urgent care but PT/PTT/INR and a CRP were drawn here, which were unremarkable.  A Covid PCR is negative.  Neurosurgery, neurology, and hematology were consulted.  Neurology recommended heparin and a hypercoagulable workup and hematology agreed with this plan.  The patient was admitted to the ICU for neuro checks and monitoring during initiation of heparin.

I did a bunch of research however I did not find anything about chest pain related to the second dose of Pfizer. I am not sure if it is some type of tissue or muscle pain or something more serious. When I massage my chest it does not ache like the muscle pain from my shoulder so id assume it has to do with maybe my lungs or heart.

                                                came to see me 3 days after his first Pfizer Covid vaccine and had been having a subjective fever, bad headache and stomach ache since the day the vaccine was administered. He incidentally had some weight loss noted at the visit over the previous 6 months for which I did some lab work. The lab work was normal except for his platelet count which was 111,000. A repeat platelet count done a week later was normal at 273,000. Because of the transient decrease in platelet count and the 3 days of bad headache after the vaccine, I decided to hold off on  getting a second Covid vaccine. Additionally and possibly of no significance, his mother apparently had a history of ITP during her childhood.

                                                Pt was seen at ED on5/8 for L sided weakness in the setting of a headache. Pt?s mother reports that these symptoms began 2 days after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in R deltoid. She says that on 5/6, pt complained of L arm weakness during cooking class at school, which was followed by a mild L sided headache later in the day. Symptoms resolved without intervention but recurred on 5/8 with associated L sided facial droop, slurred speech, L arm spasms, and L foot drag.  Pt was seen at  ED for this and had a HA (5/10 in severity) at that time -- workup was unremarkable with a normal head CT, laboratory workup, and resolution of symptoms. Pediatric Neurology evaluated the pt, deemed no further workup necessary, and advised outpatient follow up.   Pt presented again to the ED on 5/10 with concern for full tonic/clonic seizure, witnessed by pt?s mother. Mother reports that she heard pt fall and went upstairs to find pt seizing on his bed -- says that pt had shaking of bilateral upper extremities (in flexed position close to chest) and symmetric lower extremity shaking; eyes were closed without clear focality or eye deviation. Also some drooling, though no incontinence or tongue biting. Episode lasted for approximately 2 minutes; pt was confused and did not recall what happened immediately afterwards but improved within the next 8 minutes. He was taken to the ED by EMS.   By the time he arrived in the ED, he had left sided weakness again. He was given Keppra 1g, placed on EEG, and was admitted. EEG overnight was read &#34;normal&#34; and additional workup was unremarkable. Pt had MRI brain completed showing cortical abnormalities in the R parietal lobe, suspected to be related to recent seizure. MRA showed patent intracranial cerebral vasculature. MRV showed no evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis. Weakness resolved by the morning and pt was back to baseline on morning of 5/11/21. However, around 9 AM, L sided weakness (face, arm&gt;leg) with associated headache recurred. Mom says that this event was captured on EEG. He was then transferred to our facility. He was placed on pEEG and had repeat labs, imaging completed. Pt did have L sided facial droop, L arm weakness, and slurred speech on arrival, but this resolved within 24 hours. Pt had one additional episode of &#34;wave&#34; of L sided weakness including L sided facial droop and slurred speech at one other time during the hospitalization, but no additional seizure like activity. He was discharged on 5/14 with a normal neuro exam-- some labs (including labs of Rheum and Id workup were pending at time of discharge.) Primary and consulting teams elected to forgo steroids but reconsider should symptoms worsen or return. Pt was readmitted on 5/16-- had an episode of expressive aphasia &#43; headache while at a social gathering; states that he became overwhelmed by the noise. No additional seizure like activity.

Pt states he has had 1 day of sudden onset L shoulder pain and chest pain. Endorses dyspnea due to pain with deep breaths, denies tachypnea, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis. Endorses mild chills and aches after COVID vaccine 3 days prior to onset of symptoms, denies any fever, URI symptoms, diarrhea, rash, known COVID contacts. Pain continued to worsen and spread across his chest, causing presentation to ED this afternoon. No history of PE, DVT, long travel, recent surgery, malignancy, alcohol or cocaine use. Significant cardiac history in family: dad with CAD w/LAD blockage, both parents with hypertension.    At ED, labs notable for elevated troponin 0.456, repeat 0.67 and diffuse ST elevations on EKG concerning for pericarditis. COVID neg, CXR unremarkable, blood cx drawn, no abx started. Patient was given toradol for pain with minimal improvement. Peds cardiology was consulted and patient was transferred to different ED for further care.   At different ED, repeat EKG showed similar diffuse ST elevations in I, II, aVL. Repeat troponins uptrending (4.91), proBNP 562, ESR 43, CRP 18. Mildly tachycardic but otherwise hemodynamically stable. Given tylenol for pain. Cardiology recommended admission for trending troponins, echo and cardiac monitoring.  CV: Troponins were trended every 12 hours with a max of 4.91.  His last troponin checked on the morning of discharge was 0.41.  He had an echo that showed normal cardiac function, an MRI that indicated normal ventricular size and function, with minimal or healing and inflammation or mild myocarditis.  During his admission, he had continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, that did not show any arrhythmias.   Resp: On 2L NC for comfort, no respiratory distress or hypoxia.   FENGI: Regular diet   Neuro: Ibuprofen scheduled and tylenol PRN for pain.  He was initially started on ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, but was starting to have pain prior to being due for medicine every 8 hours so his regimen was changed to 600 mg every 6 hours which controlled his pain adequately.   ID: Myocarditis panel sent with some results still pending.  Thus far, he is CMV negative, EBV IgG was positive but not IgM.  RVP was negative.  This all occurred in the setting receiving the Covid vaccine 3 days prior to presentation, which has been reported as a rare reaction to the Covid vaccine.  At the time of discharge, labs pending results include mycoplasma pneumonia, coxsackie, parvovirus, enterovirus. Etiology of myocarditis remains unclear at this time, could be related to infectious etiology not yet clear to us, vs related to his COVID vaccine prior to admission.

                                                Patient received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 5/7/21. On 5/13/21 he began to feel feverish (unsure Tmax, never took temperature) and was intermittently febrile until hospital admission on 5/20/21. On 5/18/21 he was seen in the ED for fever and tested positive for strep throat and started on amoxicillin. His inflammatory labs were elevated at this time and did not notice improvement on amoxicillin. He returned to the ED on 5/20/21 at which time patient reported headaches on the right side, sharp 7/10 pain which come and go with the fevers as well as fatigue, muscle/body aches, and sweats in addition to persistent fever. He also noticed maculopapular rash on palms and soles and on distal extremities which was not pruritic or painful on day of hospital admission. All infectious workup was negative and patient did not improve on broad spectrum antibiotics. Given his persistent fever, hypotension, and inflammatory labs without other cause, patient was empirically treated for MIS-C and was given IVIG and methylprednisolone as well as being started on prophylactic dose enoxaparin for his elevated D-dimer. Repeat echocardiogram identified a new coronary aneurysm, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. Following IVIG and steroids patient remained afebrile and inflammatory markers down trended, however liver enzymes remained elevated at time of discharge. He improved and was discharged to finish steroid course at home with close follow up.

When dad came, we registered patient as normal asking if he feels ill or not and he stated no. When I brought him back to the room we were talking about school and activities he is in and he seemed normal and answering normally just tired. I cleaned his arm and talked him through things that can happen with the second dose of Pfizer. He seemed just fine and once I injected and bandaged him he went stiff and I tried to talk to him and he did not respond. I called for help and they got his dad. he finally started coming too and was extremely warm. I sat with him for 10 to 15 minutes and rubbed his back and we got him water to drink. we started an incident report right away while talking to the dad. nothing further happened and he was told to go straight to the clinic to be checked out.

                                                Patient evaluated at local hospital for concern for meningitis / encephalitis, transferred to our facility and was able to get studies (detailed below some of which are still pending).   Initial symptoms presented with rhinorrhea, then severee headache, neck pain, and fever (tactile). Had sweats and chills. Began to experience diarrhea, dysuria, diffue body aches and myalgias. Severe pain in his neck / posterior occiput. Denied any mental status changes at the time.   Studies largely negative for an identifiable bacterial process so presumptive diagnosis is aseptic meningitis. Unclear if from vaccine or other etiologies. Outside hospital had started antibiotics but this was stopped and patient symptomatically recovered with only symptomatic care.

I told him to drink more water and I gave him some Tylenol. I told him to keep me posted as to how he felt. The next morning, he said he hadn&#39;t slept all night - he had a dull pain that didn&#39;t go away when he moved. It traveled up his upper leg and up to his right hip. Moving and stretching didn&#39;t make it go away. Constant dull pain. I took him to ER. It took 36 -48 hours before it faded. He didn&#39;t wake up with it on Saturday.

A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm, at age 17 years, on 12Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pressure in his eye from an injury, asthma (diagnosed when the patient was about 2) and has family members with asthma and heart conditions. Patient is in perfect health, he works out 6 days a week, and does football conditioning 5 days a week. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Concomitant medication included timolol taken for pressure in his eye from an injury from an unspecified start date to 20May2021. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. The patient historically received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number: EP7534) at the left arm at age 17 years on 22Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient got his second dose of the vaccine on 12Apr2021 and shorty after on 19Apr2021, he became very fatigued, very weak, his chest hurt, and he had shortness of breath. On Apr2021, patient had dizziness. The patient used to have bulky arms and now you can see his muscle mass depleting in Apr2021. The patient cannot focus on school online because of the headaches from 19Apr2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure goes up and down from 19Apr2021. For days from 19Apr2021, the patient&#39;s heart rate will be fine in the 60s and it goes up to 120 or 130 with chest pain, it fluctuates depending on the day.  The patient visited the emergency room on 05May2021, but was not admitted and no one knows what was going on with the vaccine. It was also reported that the patient lost 14 pounds on 25Apr2021 since the second dose of the vaccine. They knew the patient has already lost 10 pounds and then yesterday, 25May2021, the patient weighed himself and noticed he has lost another 4 pounds over the weekend. Patient had bloodwork on 20May2021 and it was all negative. The primary care provider was concerned about the weight loss so she ran a bunch of blood work. The patient is negative for COVID test and chest x-ray on 21May2021 and he has had multiple tests done. The patient went to his primary care provider on 25May2021 (yesterday from the time off reporting) and the reporter mentioned that maybe can they look at this as being a side effect from the vaccine. The patient&#39;s doctor laughed and said nothing has been proven yet about this. The reporter felt that this is a reaction to the vaccine. At the time of reporting on 26May2021, the patient was not able to function and sleeps all day. The patient also underwent lab tests and procedures that includes being tested negative for mono twice now (on unspecified dates). Clarified that they have not filed a safety report with Pfizer on the patient&#39;s events.

Question is whether he should get the second shot or not. Is 6 to potentially 8 days of side effects a concern? Also, parent has been curious as to whether son was a long hauler from covid for brain fog but son thinks it could be burnout from school. Strange that  had such a long lasting reaction compared to to others his gneral age, including those who had covid after he had it so longer ago.

I went to sleep and at around 2 or 3 am I woke up freezing cold and sweating, with my left arm (arm I got the shot in) hurting a ton. I didn?t fall asleep for a few hours and couldn?t get out of bed due to coldness, lethargy, and muscle soreness. Next day had a moderate headache throughout the day that Ibuprofen didn?t help with. By 10 pm Friday all symptoms other than arm soreness had disappeared.

He initially had chest pain the day prior to admission with pain in his back and down his left arm. This improved with Tylenol and resolved prior to bed. On the morning of 5/6 the chest pain returned and was so severe it woke him from sleep. He was difficult for him to characterize, but he said it was all over his chest, sometimes sharp and pressure-like, most severe in mid substernal region and was so substantial that he had difficulty speaking properly. He feels that the pain is most severe when lying flat and is best managed when he is resting at a 45 degree angle. Patient was at ED he was found to have an initial ECG with ST depressions in aVR and elevations in II, aVF, and V2 through V6 raising suspicion for pericarditis/myocarditis. Initial troponin was elevated at 4.35 as well. Cardiology Dr. was contacted by ED physician, case discussed, and EKGs reviewed and felt this was more likely pericarditis, but not STEMI. Of note, he reports a family history significant for his mother having a?hole in her heart.?He was given Toradol with improvement in his pain and upon arrival to hospital his chest pain was markedly improved.  He was noted to have troponins peaking at 39.415 that down trended and an elevated CRP of 4.8 on admission. D-dimer was 0.26. Covid PCR was negative.  He was evaluated by cardiology again here who upon review of his ECG and cardiac enzymes as well as presentation was consistent with pericarditis. Echocardiogram showed normal LV systolic function with trace posterior pericardial effusion and telemetry was monitored without any arrhythmias. He was started on low-dose beta-blockers, aspirin 650 mg 3 times a day, and colchicine 0.6 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses followed by 0.6 mg daily. He is planned to continue this for approximately 3 months and will need to follow-up with cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks for repeat monitoring and management with plan to taper off aspirin once his CRP normalizes.  Later that night, he even had a similar episode of sudden onset chest pain for which she received IV Toradol with minimal relief and oral Tylenol with relief of symptoms after that. No telemetry abnormalities were recorded at that time.   ECG the following day showed improving ST changes and troponin of 26.328 with CRP 4.2. He had no further symptoms for over 24 hours and is responding well to treatment.   He is advised to take Tylenol as needed in addition to the above-mentioned medicines should he have any recurrent chest pain.

Coughing- Did not treat, mostly disappeared by the next day. Only a very minor and sporadic cough still remains. Minor feeling of congestion- Did not treat, not serious enough to warrant action. Still present today.

She said that he did NOT have any redness or swelling at injection site.  She said that he is on the spectrum, so complicates asking him about symptoms.  She confirmed that he was NOT experiencing any lip/tongue swelling or trouble breathing.  She said he was running hand under water because it &#34;felt tight&#34;.  After counseling, I followed up with her 40 mins later and she reported that his symptoms were much improved without any treatment.

                                                Per patient he received his second Covid vaccine 3 days prior to arrival and immediately following developed myalgias, subjective fevers and &#34; viral symptoms&#34; which she managed with ibuprofen 2 tabs q6h some improvement.  On the day prior to arrival he developed increasing shortness of breath particularly with talking and with ambulation.  He also describes chest tightness with deep inspiration, the tightness radiates to back, no radiation to left arm or jaw.  Chest tightness is non-positional, but does feel worse immediately after he lies down from ambulation and then slowly dissipates.  His last subjective fever was yesterday evening.  He has never had a reaction to the vaccine before.  He has no allergies.  No prior medical conditions he is aware of, and takes no medications.  He did not experience any of the symptoms following the first vaccine. He has h/o asymptomatic COVID infection in November 2020. Cardiology consulted for concern of pericarditis post COVID-19 vaccine. He does not have significant ST elevation or PR depression.  He also does not have evidence of significant pericardial effusion at this point.  The high sensitivity troponins are mildly elevated.  He does have viral syndrome.  Is unclear if Covid vaccination was causally related to his symptoms.  We would like to improve his medications for better chest pain control and to prevent recurrent pericarditis in the future.

This was worsened by laying flat and better if he waked around/pacing. He took ibuprofen and it got better so he went back to sleep. The pain returned about 6 hours later and was getting more severe so he went to see his doctor. There an EKG was abnormal so he was referred to the ED where a work up showed ST elevations c/w pericarditis and an elevated trop I of 24.   The night prior, he reported a low grade temperature. He has not had any more fevers for the past 12-18 hours. He denies any other symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, cough syncope. He denies sick contacts but did have a sore throat 4-5 days ago without any other associated symptoms. He has had recent negative COVID tests while at college.    Of note he did receive the 2nd dose of Pfizer on 5/15 about 24-36 hours before onset of symptoms.    Of note, he does boxing at school and has been participating in work outs until about a week ago.   ED course: EKG w/ diffuse ST segment elevation in V3-V6, I, II, II, AVF. Troponin I 24. Creatnine 1.2 with baseline of 0.5 but BUN WNL (11). CBC WNL, CRP mildly elevated to 3.1, Transferred to another ED.   Second ED Course: BP 120/64  | Pulse 83  | Temp 36.7 °C (98.1 °F) (Temporal)  | Resp 18  | Wt 76.3 kg  | SpO2 97% exam non-focal, COVID ab notable for &#43;spike neg nuclear capsid consistent with vax but no infection, D-Dimer, procal, ESR, ferritin, Coags all WNL, Trop T elevated to 1.46,, ECG with consistent diffuse ST seg elevations, seen by ped cards who did echo in ED and notable for EF ~50%, admitted to PCICU for further management and treatment  Admitted to the PCICU in stable condition. Placed on telemetry monitoring for the duration of the admission. Started on IV steroids and given IVIG on hospital day 1. Continued on toradol which was switched to motrin on hospital day 2. Cardiac MRI did not show signs of fibrosis. Troponin downtrended throughout his stay. At the time of DC echo showed normal function, ekg showed T wave inverions, and troponin was down trending to 0.57. Pt to be restricted from physical activity until cleared by cardiology. Infectious workup also sent, most of which was pending at time of discharge.

The following day developed substernal chest pain radiating to neck and left shoulder and arm.   Also reports fever of 101 degrees on 5/10/2021.  Used Tylenol, initially with some reloief, but symptoms worsened over the course of the next few days.  Then presented to ER on 5/13/21 because of worsening pain.    EKG showed diffuse ST elevations c/w pericarditis.  Initial Troponin 11.1, ultimately peaking at 13.67, c/w myopericarditis.   Admitted to hospital for supportive care, and treated with PO colchicine.   A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal LV function without segmental wall motion abnormality and no pericardial effusion.  A Cardiac CT showed normal coronary arteries.     The patient&#39;s symptoms improved with colchicine.   He was discharged home with a course of colchicine on 5/15/21.   A subsequent outpatient Cardiac MRI did show epicardial and mid wall late gadolinium enhancement involving the basal to mid lateral and inferolateral walls, and a mid wall stripe of distal anteroseptal, septal and inferoseptal segments, c/w myocarditis, idiopathic cardiomyopathy or sarcoidosis.  The pericardium was borderline thickened at 3 mm.

The patient had syncope about 2 minutes after sitting and fell from a seated position on his chair to the ground. He had a brief seizure (unresponsive, tense muscles, open eyes) for about 2-5 seconds. He then became responsive and was able to respond to prompts and questions. He was given water. an ice pack (for injured spot on forehead), and told to wait for 30 minutes for further observation. He arranged to have a friend pick him up to take him home from the pharmacy and was told that he could not drive himself home after this adverse reaction. The patient stated that he otherwise felt normal afterwards (aside from some ache from the forehead after falling).

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The vaccine was administered to the writer at 0800 on 1/5/2021. No immediate reactions were noticed for the 30 minutes observation period immediately after. The writer&#39;s muscle that received the vaccine began to become increasingly sore throughout the day; however, that was similar to the first dose of the same vaccine a few weeks prior. The pain was described as constant (2/10) but aggravated with motion. The pain did interfere with the writer&#39;s normal range of motion (specifically raising the writer&#39;s arm above shoulder height). From 0800-2200 on 1/5/2021 no noticeable symptoms except for the injection site pain occurred.   At 2200, the writer rapidly developed chills, body aches, a headache, fatigue, and a fever of 100.8. These symptoms were left untreated and continued through the night (the symptoms did not interfere with sleep). The writer woke up at 1300 on 1/6/2021; all previous symptoms had resolved by this time except for the injection site pain. By 1400 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed pain near the right axillary lymph nodes. The pain can be described as moderate (1/10) and generally occurred only with motion. The writer was unable to palpate any swelling in the area. Around 1800 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed it felt weird to swallow. Specifically, it felt as if there was a slight internal swelling 1-inch subhyoidally and 1-2 inches laterally within the right side of his neck when he swallowed. The swelling was not palpable from the skin&#39;s surface. The writer did not seek medical attention as breathing/eating/drinking were not made more difficult but monitored this closely. The swelling in the neck resolved by 2000 on 1/6/2021. The lymph node pain in the right arm resolved over the course of a few days and was no longer present by 1/9/2021 at 1300.

I walked over to him within 60-120 seconds after the vaccine administration and found him to be in a stiff full body extended position while sitting on a chair. I asked him if he was ok. He did not respond. Called over the nurse and we were about to bring him down to the ground after suspecting a seizure. Patient &#34;came to&#34; after about 90 seconds of no movement. Patient became alert and orientated. When asked about prior seizure history, patient stated they had a traumatic injury to their back within the last month which resulted with spontaneous seizures throughout the past 2 weeks. Patient was asked to follow-up with primary care provider or seek urgent care/emergency care if it happens again. Patient observed for 30&#43; minutes until his girlfriend came to pick him up.

He said that beginning 24-48 hours after his vaccine he began to experience &#34;a sore throat, swollen lips, conjunctivis in both eyes, pain and muscle aches, and hives/boils all over his body.  He asked if he should go to an urgent care center.  His mother had suggested an urgent care.  He wanted us to complete  the form and was going to the Urgent Care.  Couldn&#39;t find his vaccine card, so called him with Lot # and expiration of dose.  Advised to call us back after being seen to update his condition.

                                                I felt muscle aches and pains  about 6-8 hours after I received the vaccine. I had COVID-19 in late January 2021, and these symptoms from the vaccine felt about the same as the COVID symptoms I had, they just didn&#39;t last as long. However, around 36 hours after I received my vaccine, my armpit area started to become sore. It has felt swollen and sore for the past 36-48 hours. I also developed a fever of around 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit today, so around 72 hours after I received the vaccine. I have also been fatigued for the past 3 days.

This started at around midnight in my  bed while I was asleep the same day I got my shot. I&#39;m autistic, and I?m in a therapy program with other autistic 20 year olds and those who also got the shot were likewise experiencing the same symptoms as me. I have yet to recover.

                                                Initial presentation Patient was in his usual state of good health until 4/19 when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. He awoke the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. The next day he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the ED with a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure of 100/69mmHg, heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, patient was ill-appearing with diffuse pustules on his face, chest and back, periorbital edema, and leukoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa. His abdomen was soft and tender to palpation in the suprapubic area and at both costovertebral angles. Hospital course In the ED the patient was found to have a metabolic acidosis of pH 7.33 with an anion gap of 16, lactate 2.6, neutrophilic leukocytosis (22k), acute renal insufficiency with a BUN of 45 and creatinine 3.81 (baseline is 0.76). The patient?s urine demonstrated packed RBCs and 5-10 WBCs. He was admitted to the medicine service for further management. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have rhabdomyolysis (CK 584), worsening renal failure (Creatinine 8), follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. CT A/P without contrast showed increased attenuation of renal pelves and ureters consistent with hemorrhage, but no renal stones or hydronephrosis was seen. The patient was treated with pulse dose 500mg IV Methylprednisilone for 3 days and then transitioned to 60mg Prednisone. The patient?s pustular rash and oral leukoplakia greatly improved while on pulse dose steroids, but his kidney function continued to decline (Creatinine rising from 8 to 11), and the patient?s bilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. Bilateral hearing loss prompted an MRI of the brain which identified several punctate infarcts across multiple vascular territories in bilateral cortices and left cerebellum. The patient?s kidney function has continued to decline, with progressive hyperkalemia and hemodialysis was begun.

A 20-year-old male patient first dose of received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), intramuscular, administered in left arm on 19Apr2021, at the age of 20-years old, (Lot Number: EW0151) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19. It was reported that the patient was in his usual state of good health until 19Apr2021, when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. On 20Apr2021, he woke up the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. On21Apr2021, he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the Emergency department. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have worsening renal failure, follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. The patient&#39;s unilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. His kidney function continued to decline and hemodialysis was begun on 27Apr2021. His kidney function continued to decline on hemodialysis, becoming so he was transferred to the MICU for CRRT. The patient was hospitalized for 12 days due to the events, the events were also  assessed as life-threathening. The patient been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination with unknown result. The outcome of the events was unknown. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Began with severe full body chills and full body muscle shaking and weakness during the night of 1/5 and early morning of 1/6, around 1000 to 0200. Slight headache began during that time as well.   Upon waking at 0900 on 1/6, chills and shaking decreased to mild severity, muscles still felt moderately weak and shaky, headache had increased in severity to a severe throbbing pain that worsened upon standing and walking, and moderate visual photosensitivity began. The headache persisted until I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen 200 mg, which is when the severity decreased to moderate after a few hours and then mild by bedtime. The photosensitivity persisted through the day and did not decrease much by bedtime.   Upon waking 1/7, there was only a mild headache and mild photosensitivity that faded completely within a few hours, no medication required. No more symptoms in the afternoon.

This was followed by chest pains.  These chest pains prompted him to seek care in the ER.  Upon workup, I found the patient to have developed myocarditis with a significantly elevated troponin prompting hospitalization.

                                                ED Visit 3/11/21 History of Present Illness 21 year old man pmhx of autism, recurrent abscesses, presents with complaint of L axilla swelling and drainage. Pt received COVID vaccine in L arm on 3/1. Pt did well until 3/5 when he started to complain of pain in the L armpit. Mother examined the area and did not see anything concerning. The pain continued through the weekend, no fevers. Pt felt warm on Monday, no temperature taken. Mother then noted a few &#34;bump&#34; near the L armpit. The bumps continued to swell and be painful on Tuesday, went to pediatrician and was prescribed Keflex. Pt has been taking Keflex but continues to spike fevers, Tmax 102F on Wednesday. Pt had fevers yesterday and today of &#34;about 100.&#34; Pt took a nap today, and woke up with the area draining. Mother states that the drainage was smelly pus. Called PCP who recommended evaluation. ED course: Patient observed in the emergency department of antipyretics and did not have any further fever.  I will switch his treatment to clindamycin and provide topical bacitracin and provide strict criteria to come back if pt became febrile instructions provided to mom.   Patient safe for discharge to home. Discharged in improved condition. Written instructions reviewed with family.  3/18/2021 Discharge Summary History of Present Illness 21yo man with h/o autism and multiple soft tissue infections including cellulitis and pilonidal cyst who presented to the ED 3/13/2021 after axillary drainage and fever.  He had been treated outpatient with keflex, but continued to have fevers at home. Re-evaluated at ED and placed on clindamycin. Cultures from outpatient showing skin flora. Mother has been doing several dressings of drainage at home and ongoing fevers up to 102 so was brought to the ED for evaluation. No cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, recent travel, known sick contacts.  Summary of hospitalization: He re-presented to ED on 3/13/2021 and was started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. A CT scan with contrast done to determine extension of abscess, which was fortunately limited to the subcutaneous plane (no infiltration near bone or into muscle fascia). In the ED, patient&#39;s creatinine was 1.5. Patient received IVF and his creatinine downtrended to 0.75 on 3/18/21.   The surgical course was uneventful. Successful debridement of the left axillary abscess was performed on 03/4/21. Wound cultures grew Actinomyces Europaeus and S. Epidermidis and Infectious Disease was consulted. Their antibiotic recommendations to discontinue the cefepime/flagyl and start vanc/CTX were followed. Sensitivity analyses showed S. Epidermidis was sensitive to linezolid, tetracyclin, tigecyclin, bactruim and vancomycin. The Actinomyces Europaeus sensitivities have not yet resulted at time of discharge. Per ID recommendations, the vanc and CTX were discontinued and oral doxycycline was started, which should be continued for 6 months. It could be considered to switch to PO amoxicillin after 2 weeks and finish the 6 month course with amoxicillin. This will be discussed during outpatient follow-up. Per ID recommendations, the following labs should be checked 2 weeks after discharge (on 3/29/21) and could be spaced out to every 4 weeks thereafter if normal: CBC with differential, CRP, ESR, BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT.  The patient is scheduled to see (ID) on 5/5/21. Dermatology was consulted per ID recs for evaluation of spots on the chest and back. Per dermatology these spots are keloid, not suspicious for hidradenitis suppurative, there is no need for biopsy. For pilonidal cyst spot dermatology recommends rec hibicleans cream. Immunology was consulted for recurring abscesses and recommended the following tests, which were ordered, in addition to outpatient followup: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, specific Ab titers: for strep pneumo IgG (23 serotypes) and tetanus IgG, lymphocyte subsets, T cell memory panel, B cell memory panel, neutrophil DHR, CH50.  A wound VAC was placed on the left axillary wound bed on 03/15/21 and exchanged on 3/17/21.  Patient tolerated the wound vac changes well with 5mg of oxycodone taken 1 hour prior to the vac change. On 03/18/21 patient was discharged with a home wound vac and VNA.  At the time of discharged patient was afebrile, his pain was well controlled, his oxygen saturations were &gt;94% on room air, he was tolerating a regular diet and voiding/stooling without issues.

Blood-work was normal other than slightly elevated lymphocyte % (50.8%)Visited a specialty medicine doctor on 2/25 and had x-rays done of legs. Results normal. Thought to have developed Achilles tendinitis. Possibly attributed to inflammation in legs, doctor wasn&#39;t sure. Rough quote &#34;could it be from the vaccine, possibly, we just don&#39;t know.&#34; Have been doing stretches since which has helped the leg pain. Starting on March 12, I began to have pain in my left arm again, and ended up getting vertigo that evening. The arm pain persisted on and off from then on out, as well as occasional dizziness, which I treated with Dramamine. I did get an appointment scheduled with a neurologist in May that I still have. On March 25, I began to feel unwell, with a fever, dizziness, and a headache. That worsened into the evening, and I woke up at around 3 am with a high fever, that ended up going to about 103 F, and began vomiting around 4:30am on Friday, which persisted into the evening. On Saturday evening I began to feel better. With that recovery, the constant leg pain and frequent arm pain seemed to be gone, and has yet to return to the degree that it had been prior to that bout of sickness.  I do still occasionally get arm or leg pain, but it&#39;s minor and only lasts about 20-30 minutes at a time.

Attempted to stop the chills by wrapping in several blankets, but only continued to feel colder and colder. Despite the chills starting around 11pm, fever did not present itself until around 1am, hitting 99.8°F by 1:30am. It was around this time that I took an ibuprofen and acetaminophen, which did not kick in until around 2:30am. Once the chills stopped, my hands and feet only got hotter, keeping me awake for an additional 2 1/2 hours.

                                                myocarditis; Strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe; Pericarditis/inflammation around the heart; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). This consumer reported similar events for two patients (twins). This is the first of two reports.  A 22-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 26Apr2021 10:00, as 2nd dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization, at a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included ongoing rare metabolic disorder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735) received at age 22 years, on 05Apr2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. On 26Apr2021, the patient received the second dose of BNT162B2. In the evening of the same day, 26Apr2021, the patient experienced tiredness/fatigue, and headache. In the morning of 27Apr2021, the patient was feeling really crappy and they though it was like the flu and it would pass. In the evening of 27Apr2021, the patient didn&#39;t sleep at all and was uncomfortable all night and pain. On the same day, 27Apr2021, the patient had severe chest pain, chest tightness, and lightheadedness. On 28Apr2021, the pain didn&#39;t go away, and the twins had elevated ST evaluation on the EKG (electrocardiograph). ST evaluation was done by the reporter&#39;s husband who is a retired firefighter emergency medical technician. The reporter decided to take the patient to hospital and said that the other twin had the same symptoms but kept saying his wasn&#39;t as bad as his brother&#39;s because he did not want to go to the hospital. The doctor advised the reporter to bring the other twin. The twins had the same echo cardiogram on 28Apr2021 (unknown results). On 28Apr2021, their troponin levels were elevated, and their cardiac enzymes continued to go up. On the same day, 28Apr2021, the patient had a strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe. It was reported that the twins were hospitalized on 28Apr2021 with myocarditis/pericarditis and inflammation around the heart. Treatment for myocarditis/pericarditis included ibuprofen and colchicine; and Toradol for breakthrough pain. The reporter stated that the twins are two identical males with the same DNA, had the vaccine at the same time, had the reactions at the same length of time, have the same lifestyle and live at the same house. The reporter said it would go a long way if they help her understand the complication. The patient recovered &#34;strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe&#34; on 29Apr2021. The outcome of the event myocarditis and pericarditis/inflammation around the heart was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021487544 same reporter, suspect drugs and events; different patients

                                                Chest Pain, Myopericarditis; From EPIC: From cardiologist healthy man who comes to the ER with left anterior chest discomfort for the last 36 hours or so.  Symptoms are made worse by deep inspiration.  Were improved following self administration of 600 mg of ibuprofen earlier today.  2 days ago he received his second COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer).  Following day he experienced arm pain muscular aches and pains severe discomfort of the right arm (injection site) later in the day there was nausea and vomiting on one occasion (nonheme).  By last night he was able to eat dinner but subsequently felt short of breath with worsening chest discomfort morning the left arm continued to ache with musculoskeletal pains.  Developed more discomfort in the left anterior chest radiating to the throat made worse by deep inspiration. Does not describe typical sharp catching pain of pericarditis.  No cough sputum bruising bleeding abdominal pain change in color or character of bowels.  Sign in the emergency room he was hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm with a normal EKG.Torrey work-up notable for an initial troponin of 1.28 and a follow-up troponin of 2.14. Chest x-ray perfectly normal. Elevated d-dimer. CT angiography negative for pulmonary embolism vascular injury, cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion but the radiologist did note thickening of several right posterior and lateral axillary lymph nodes raising a question of recent right-sided vaccination or injury/infection to the right arm. Presently he is perfectly comfortable able to take a deep inspiration with mild chest discomfort, breathing easily.  I met him in July 2018He came to the emergency room with a 3-day viral syndrome manifested as headache nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal discomfort and then developed chest discomfort.  He was found with diffuse mild J-point elevation on EKG consistent with a viral type pericarditis with troponins which rose to a maximum of 10.4.  Work-up for myocarditis was negative.  Echocardiogram perfectly normal.  Symptoms responded to a course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine.  Seen in follow-up of repeat echocardiogram was perfectly healthy.  Our diagnosis was myopericarditis. There is no history of shortness of breath dyspnea on exertion decrement of exercise capacity peripheral edema orthopnea PND palpitations lightheadedness syncope or collapse.  No ill contacts.  He works in a high security position and therefore qualified for early administration of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  Graph past medical history notable only for the episode of myopericarditis and a remote tonsillectomy. There is no significant family history of sudden cardiac death or unusual heart disease. He takes no medications. Patient was recommended to take 4 weeks of ibuprofen and colchicine if needed for worsening chest pain.  Patient was recommended to follow-up closely with his primary care doctor and check ESR, C-reactive protein as well as renal function.  Needs close follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.

Both of my arms had a very tingly feeling and felt  heavy  and then became completely  numb and I was unable to move to either arm for approximately 45 minutes.  Movement slowly came back  throughout the evening and over the next week. My legs felt tingly and heavy. I continue to have periodic tingly feeling in my joints through out my body. My chest felt heavy.  I felt like I was doing to die.  Large red swollen area where shot was given. I have COVID 19 in Feb, 2021. Health care profession suspects the reaction may have been related to having COVID-19, second dose not recommended. Likely to have antibodies. I have not felt 100 percent since receiving vaccine.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) and a contactable other healthcare professional. This consumer reported similar events for two patients (twins). This is the first of two reports.  A 22-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 26Apr2021 10:00 (at the age of 22-year-old) as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization, at a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included ongoing rare metabolic disorder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735) received at age 22 years, on 05Apr2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. On 26Apr2021, the patient received the second dose of BNT162B2. In the evening of the same day, 26Apr2021, the patient experienced tiredness/fatigue, and headache. In the morning of 27Apr2021, the patient was feeling really crappy and they though it was like the flu and it would pass. In the evening of 27Apr2021, the patient didn&#39;t sleep at all and was uncomfortable all night and pain. On the same day, 27Apr2021, the patient had severe chest pain, chest tightness, and lightheadedness. On 28Apr2021, the pain didn&#39;t go away, and the twins had elevated ST evaluation on the EKG (electrocardiograph). ST evaluation was done by the reporter&#39;s husband who is a retired firefighter emergency medical technician. The reporter decided to take the patient to hospital and said that the other twin had the same symptoms but kept saying his wasn&#39;t as bad as his brother&#39;s because he did not want to go to the hospital. The doctor advised the reporter to bring the other twin. The twins had the same echo cardiogram on 28Apr2021 (unknown results). On 28Apr2021, their troponin levels were elevated, and their cardiac enzymes continued to go up. On the same day, 28Apr2021, the patient had a strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe. It was reported that the twins were hospitalized on 28Apr2021 with myocarditis/pericarditis and inflammation around the heart. Treatment for myocarditis/pericarditis included ibuprofen and colchicine; and Toradol for breakthrough pain. The reporter stated that the twins are two identical males with the same DNA, had the vaccine at the same time, had the reactions at the same length of time, have the same lifestyle and live at the same house. The reporter said it would go a long way if they help her understand the complication. The patient recovered &#34;strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe&#34; on 29Apr2021. The outcome of the event myocarditis and pericarditis/inflammation around the heart was not recovered.  Follow-up (14May2021): New information received from a contactable other healthcare professional includes: reporter details (other hcp added as a new reporter).  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

                                                At 2:00am 12/19/20 I woke up to an episode of diarrhea and was left feeling nauseous. I woke up again at 4:30am with another episode of diarrhea and severe nausea which led me to throw up. I feel better after throwing up and proceeded to get rest before going to work at 6:00am. By 8:00am I had developed a severe headache, severe nausea, muscle fatigue and overall felt bad. When I got home I had become extremely nauseous and developed severe muscle fatigue and severe arthralgia and my headache had increased and became sweaty and dizzy. I slept from 9:00am to 2:00pm where the symptoms had gotten no better and the headache had gotten worse. I slept from 3:00pm to around 6:00pm with the same symptoms but managed to eat some soup and kept it down. I slept from 10pm to 12pm the next day 12/10/20. My fatigue and joint pain had somewhat dissipated but I was still experiencing severe nausea and a severe headache. By the end of 12/10/20 around 8pm my joint pain and muscle fatigue had gotten better but the nausea and headache were still there. 12/11/20 I was well enough to drive and receive a covid test. My nausea and headache did not go away until the end of day 12/11/20

Around 9:15 at night I felt slightly warm and could tell that I was becoming febrile, but I wasn&#39;t completely there yet. Around 12:45AM on January 9th, I had massive chills and uncontrollable shivering and muscle aches. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I took another 1000 mg of acetaminophen at 6:00AM when my chills came back. At 10:45AM I was feeling febrile again, and took 600 mg of ibuprofen followed by an hour and a half nap. I had slight malaise afterwards but did not feel febrile. By 5PM, I was feeling almost completely normal and was fever free. On the morning of 1/10, I am completely recovered.

Did have some swelling and motor loss, NO CP, SOB or sensory loss, no redness, no injury, no fever, chills, ha, depression sore throat, cough, rash, lymphadenopathy, abd pain, GI distress, no trauma or recent illnesses. 2/21: admitted clinic w/rhabdomyolysis: no preceding workouts, increased activity on ship, back sleeper, no alcohol, no trauma,. nsp: skin intact, no erythema. Mild edema to upper arm around triceps. Mild purple discoloration to dorsum of hand. Palp: TTP about triceps. TTP anterior shoulder. TTP biceps. Able to palpate triceps tendon and biceps tendon. NTTP throughout the rest of hand and forearm. Hand is cooler relative to contralateral side. NTTP cervical spine. ROM: Full passive ROM of the shoulder and elbow with pain. No micromotion pain with any joint in the upper extremity. Painless cervical spine ROM. Motor: 3/5 strength to OP/FPL/2nd FDP, EIP/EPL, 1st and 2nd DIO. 3/5 deltoid, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors. Sens: Decreased sensation throughout entirety of forearm and hand distal to the elbow. Above the elbow, sensation is intact. Vasc: 2&#43; radial pulse, symmetric to contralateral side. BCR &lt;3 sec. Hand is cooler than contralateral side. Lab: CRP &lt;5, ESR 4, CK 31,924, PT 14, INR 1.1, D-dimer 0.46, AST 610, ALT 186, Cr 0.94, WBC 6.3 Imaging: Radiographs of the chest, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand demonstrate no fracture. The shoulder is well located. CTA starting at the heart demonstrate no vascular abnormalities. Assessment: unlikely that he has compartment syndrome or a cervical spine pathology. His exam does not localize to one specific innervation or muscle group. His paresthesias and diffuse 3/5 weakness on exam may be related to parsonage turner syndrome (post viral neuritis) versus edema. While he does have a cool hand and mild/moderate edema on exam, his CTA is normal and his exam is very reassuring that this is not compartment syndrome. He likely has rhabdomyolysis based on upper arm swelling in the setting of CK of 31924.   Discharge 2/22/2021: He received a total of 3 liters of IV fluids and was encouraged to drink large amounts of water. Repeat CK levels showed to be down trending as were his AST and ALT enzymes. Plain radiographs of his left arm and shoulder were unremarkable as was CT angiography of his chest. Electrolytes and renal lab work was within normal limits throughout the hospitalization.On the day of discharge, he was tolerating a PO diet, ambulating without difficulty, and hemodynamically stable. LUE w/ minimal swelling, no erythema. TTP over L triceps belly, No TTP over the distal LUE. Somewhat decreased sensation to light touch over distal LUE. 2&#43; radial pulses b/l. LUE ROM somewhat limited 2/2 pain, but intact. ---- to f/u with HCP in 2 weeks, sooner if worse (medical officer)   CK 2/22/21 was down to 14653

                                                Got woken up by intense leg pain around 6:00am the day following vaccination. I took 1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen (split between 2 pills each containing 500mg methocarbamol and 200mg ibuprofen), and 1000mg acetaminophen before a hot bath which relieved pain enough to get back to sleep around 7am. I woke up again around 11am with similar extreme pain, took another set of  1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen , and 1000mg acetaminophen along with 5mg of hydrocodone left over from recent dental work. Pain subsided  until approximately 4:00pm when legs started to hurt again before getting to severe levels around 5pm (and so did the back of my neck which was the first neck pain experienced) so I took another set of 1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen , and 1000mg acetaminophen along with 5mg of hydrocodone  (which has helped ease discomfort again).   Leg pain is not sharp but very persistent and painful and is located behind both knees.  Neck pain was sharp and located directly at the back. I have had no arm pain or injection site swelling or pain, just leg pain and neck.   I did not experience any side-effects after my first dose, not even injection site pain.

                                                About 6 hours post injection, with only a small amount of muscle soreness in the injected arm, I was suddenly very very dizzy. I ran from my living room to my bedroom and got under the sheets, I was very very cold. My whole body was twitching violently, and I had extreme muscle pain. Joints popped like knuckles cracking that I wouldn&#39;t normally be able to pop. This lasted for about 10 minutes very violently and then calmed down over another 10, and I just felt very very feverish. I felt numb all over but I was shivering a little. Moving was very hard and my whole back was very sore, with the injection arm in a little extra pain. Fell asleep until about 7:30 am, woke up still a little feverish. I have had waves of extreme dizziness and muscle aches continuing even to today a couple days later. I am also experiencing a rather persistent headache in the very center of my head, making it hard to think. I lose track of my thoughts and it feels like I can&#39;t focus, this seems to be improving gradually over time. treatment only included extra fluid intake and over the counter pain killers

A 23-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 at 1 pm (around 12:20ish as reported) (Lot Number: FN6206) (at 23-year-old) at single dose in arm right for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, no family medical history relevant to AEs. The patient stated he is a pretty healthy guy. All day after getting the vaccine he was fine. He got the shot at like 1 came home took a nap, ate some dinner, and was playing XBOX with the boys when this happened. At around 10:30 pm on 29Apr2021 he went to rub, his stomach just above his belly button and it hurt. He said that he read on line that that area is called the pancreas or liver, it has a lot of names for that area when looking online. He stated it&#39;s the left upper abdomen area he felt pain when he pressed on it. It radiated really fast across his abdomen while he was on the phone with mother. The more he pressed the more the pain got sharper, and it radiated right across the abdomen, mainly above belly button not too much in lower abdomen, not much in upper abdomen. It was very sensitive. He didn&#39;t have to press hard to trigger the pain. It was almost like the area was inflamed. It happened really fast and that it was his upper stomach not so much the lower part of his abdomen. He felt dizziness and nauseous and like a silly boy he tried to run to the bathroom. He stated that he fell and fainted. His butt was still a little sore from falling. He said when he woke up, he was sweating like he had been out side all day. He did not recall sweating any time he fainted in the past. The side effects were gone after about ten minutes. He was really light headed and had the crazy sharp pain in abdomen for about ten minutes and then it was gone. He had never had that kind of pain. He was laying on the floor for a couple minutes. He went to get his phone, and then sat back down and was sweating. He still had pain at that time but it only lasted about 10 minutes at most. He was still a little bit sore in some joints which was not unexpected. He confirmed that he had a little bit of sweating, and he fainted a little bit. Since the episode he hasn&#39;t felt any symptoms like that before, he has not had any pain like gastritis but he has had some random gastrointestinal things before. It&#39;s also reported nausea on 29Apr2021. No required to emergency room and physician office. He was on the verge of going to the ER while the pain was there. He was going to go until it stopped and to get checked out. No relevant test. The outcome of the events sore joints, dizziness and butt sore was unknown; for other events was resolved on 29Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                My first dose of the pfizer vaccine was relatively asymptomatic. Received at local hospital. Sore arm that lasted a few hours, nothing too concerning.  This adverse event describes my second dose however, received Jan 23, 2020, approximately 3 weeks after the first. Again, this was received at local hospital. The next day, I felt the expected side effects of terrible chills, whole-body myalgia, and a slight fever. Again, I was not too worried as this was expected. I could not sleep that night, but otherwise, I felt significantly better in the morning.   Unfortunately, on Jan 25, 2 days after the second dose, I began to feel a strange tingling sensation in my forearms, and a pain in my lower back. This paresthesia felt as if the insides of my arms were vibrating, and rather than a &#34;pins and needles&#34; sensation, I felt electric shocks through my forearms and extremely discomforting tingles. I could not bend forward without terrible shocks through my arms, and my back pain can only be described as aching. I immediately scheduled an appointment with my doctor for Monday afternoon, That entire Sunday, it felt as if the tingling sensation, rated at 7/10 discomfort, grew to 10/10. I physically was wincing and turning, unable to find any position where my arms were not experiencing electric vibrations. My back pain, which was tender to touch, and if I pressed hard enough on it or laid on my back, caused the same electric sensation not just in the forearms but the entirety of my upper torso and my arm. Taking deep breaths was painful, as it elicited the same discomforting paresthesia. At the time, I was one of the first groups taking the pfizer shots, and it was still unclear if taking NSAIDs was a good idea to alleviate pains and the suppress the immune response. I agonized that entire Sunday and through Monday morning, the shocking expanding from just the forearms to the shoulders around the deltoid, and the back pain soon covered my entire upper torso. For whatever reason, waist-down I was completely fine. Even bending forward only elicited the pain upwards, nothing ever went down my legs. I had slight neck stiffness, a throbbing headache, intense back aches, bilateral upper extremity paresthesia, and pain on deep inspiration at the height of my pain on Monday morning. By this point, the pain had kept me awake for almost 30 hours.  When I finally could see my doctor via telehealth appointment, he prescribed me 800 mg ibuprofen to be taken every 6-8 hours I believe. After taking the ibuprofen, the pain lessened significantly, going from 10/10 to 2/10. I was finally able to go to sleep sitting up straight on a sofa chair. The paresthesia was gone, the pain on deep inspiration was gone, but the tenderness and dull ache in the lower back seemed to stay even on the ibuprofen. I noticed that if I laid down on my back to try and sleep, even with the medicine in full effect, the electric shooting and paresthesia would immediately return. If I quickly removed pressure from that area, it went away.  The ibuprofen&#39;s effect lasted only about 5 hours. I would take another as it slowly crawled back up to 4/10 pain or if the paresthesia was returning. Over the course of an entire week, I constantly needed to be on ibuprofen. By Friday, so almost 6 days after the shot, the paresthesia and back pain could be completely suppressed by the ibuprofen and I was able to lay on my back with no problems. Without medicine, I was sitting at a dull 3-10 back pain, but the paresthesia was gone. The back pain finally vanished on Sunday, 8 days after the shot, and I no longer needed ibuprofen. No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, radiation of electrical pain down the leg, vision change, or loss of bowel/urinary control throughout the course of these symptoms.  My experience reported to my primary care doctor, via our health messages. I did not return any contact to hospital or my vaccination site.

                                                Woke up approximately 14 hours after receiving dose #2 with body fatigue. My large joints (e.g., hips, knees, elbows, shoulders) started to develops aches/discomfort. A hot shower helped relieve the initial discomfort, and I took 1g of APAP ~45 minutes after waking up. I then reported to work, which is an ambulatory care clinic that is working a drive-up clinic. As such, I had to work outside in ~20F weather. I had 4 layers on my upper body and 2 layers on lower body with wool socks. The cold did not bother me for the first two hours as I was able to return to a warm area between patients; however, as work became busy, I spent more time outside. The aches/discomfort in my joints progressively worsened as well as the general bodily fatigue. I took another 500mg of APAP, but it did not help much more. Eventually, the cold and body fatigue made breathing uncomfortable, and my breathing became slightly labored. Returning to the warm environment helped the symptoms not get worse, but focusing on tasks became slightly difficult. I returned home at approximately 1630, took another 1g of APAP, and proceeded to sleep from ~1730 until 0530 the next morning. I woke up feeling much better.

                                                After previously feeling no side effects, at 3am the day following the vaccine I awoke with chills, dizziness, fatigue, whole body arthralgias that I can only describe as feeling like my bedsheets felt like broken glass. Around 6am I measured my axillary temperature to be 100.9 F and took 650 Tylenol once which broke the fever. I was unable to go in to work that day. Now, two days after the vaccine, my other symptoms have resolved aside from a painful, and visibly noticable, lymph adenopathy in my left arm pit the same side as the vaccine.

I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

                                                The first few days it was extreme muscle pain in my shoulder and arm. My arm was swollen for about 3 days, I couldn?t move my arm for almost a whole week. My muscles were very weak in the arm and hurt to put pressure on it and couldn?t lift my arm. It has gotten better but it has now been 3 weeks and I am still experiencing some muscle pain and weakness in my left shoulder. The shit was administered in my left arm  directly below my shoulder bone.  I still can?t move my arm to shoulder height or higher with feeling pain and weakness in the muscle.

                                                I experienced chills, which intensified in the evening into full body shudders before finally calming. Alongside this, I felt extremely sore, especially in the joints and feet, like they had or were being pressed or squeezed. This made it hard to move around or get out of bed. I also experienced a headache, and likely a fever.  I had similar symptoms after my first shot, but while those symptoms were still noticeable and took me out of work, I had a much stronger reaction this time around. I have been experiencing a sore neck and shoulders due to tension even until today.

                                                He states he had the first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in the series on 4/13/2021.  He states that two days later on 4/15/2021 he felt like his feet were heavy.  He continues to experience that sensation in his feet, and even feeling like his feet are asleep at nighttime and when he first gets up in the morning.  The asleep feeling in the feet gets better when he gets up and moves around but the heavy sensation in the legs does not get better.  He states that his mobility is affected though that his legs feel heavy and he is not as easily mobile as he used to be. He feels his balance is off. Patient later reported that he did have and episode of syncope about 5 minutes after he got the vaccine but otherwise was doing okay until 4/15/2021.  He presented to the ED with these symptoms on 5/3/2021 at approximately 7:14pm and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation.  Patient states that he normally exercises regularly and has been having a great deal of difficulty especially with squatting and now has difficulty walking up stairs, feels very weak and his legs feel heavy.   He reports that the numbness and tingling sensation of his feet when sleeping is new and he has never had it in the past.  Symptoms get worse with exertion and prolonged activity.  Neurologist was consulted and several tests were ordered.  Neurology consult noted that patient had a prior COVID 19 infection in November 2020.  Per neurologist notes: His symptoms first started about two days after he received Pfizer COVID vaccine on April 13, 2021.  He recalled feeling his feet heaviness and it was hard to pick them up.  He also had some calf pain.  He also had difficulty with doing his stretches and yoga positioning.  A week ago, he began to have difficulty with picking up a ball or anything from the ground.  He also developed pins and needles at the fingertips at the same time he developed tingling sensation of his feet.  He also has lower back pain.  He tested positive for SARS-COV-2 antigen on November 12, 2020.  He recalled having symptoms lasting for a few days consisting of diaphoresis, cough, and flu-like symptoms.  Per neurologist, symptoms seem to resemble acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP).  Patient was treated with IVIG for 5 days.

                                                24-year-old male with no prior medical problems presents for evaluation of chest pain.  Patient complains of midsternal chest pain that started approximately an hour ago.  He states that it woke him up from sleep.  Pain is sharp without any radiation or other associated symptoms including diaphoresis presyncopal symptoms or palpitations.  He denies any significant air hunger or shortness of breath.  He otherwise had been feeling better after what he tall was post COVID vaccine symptoms.  Patient received a 2nd dose of pfizer vaccine 3 days ago.  He states that within 24 hours he had symptoms of myalgia fever and feeling unwell.  That has been resolving patient has been feeling better until the chest pain today. Patient otherwise denies any other medical problems in.  He denies any history of drug use including any recent cocaine or other drug abuse.   Elevated cardiac enzymes and chest discomfort are likely secondary to myocarditis and secondary to vaccination/ inflammatory reaction.  Although there is low likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease as well.  I recommended cardiac catheterization for clarification.  He does not want to have the procedure done, understands the risk of undiagnosed coronary artery disease and risk of MI.  He would like to be discharged home.    I reviewed the images of echocardiogram and it seems that he has a small area of hypokinesis in infero basal segment.   Recommended to take aspirin and be seen in Cardiology office in 2 weeks.  Advised to abstain from exercise and significant physical activity till that time and return to the hospital if any symptoms.       Subjective:   I saw patient in consultation for evaluation of chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes.   Patient is a 24-year-old healthy male who had COVID-19 vaccination with his second Pfizer shot 4/14/21. He developed fever, chills, nausea and vomiting 1 day after vaccination.  He did not have any reaction to the 1st dose.   He presented to the hospital with substernal chest discomfort which woke him up from sleep, radiated to throat and had a throbbing feeling.  This lasted for 1 to 2 hours and subsided completely in the hospital.   He smokes 5 cigarettes a day, is physically very active and exercises regularly.  He is not on any medication at home.

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  I experienced extreme chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath, painful heart beats, I could feel each beat. I hunched over in my bed groom grabbing my abdomen and fell onto my bed and almost passed out from whack I?d assume is lack of oxygen. I could barely breathe for about five minutes and felt relatively severe pain particularly in the right side of my chest. I could feel every muscle, tendon, and artery inflamed, enlarged, and hurting. My chest felt like it filled up with a balloon. Heart rate went up too. I have NEVER EVER felt ANYTHING like this in my LIFE. Not even close. It was a brand new sensation to me first time I?ve ever felt anything like this at all, and very intense and frustrating. Keeping in mind I am in perfect health. I am a body builder with a perfect physique. I work at a high end restaurant and have an extremely good diet. I have a normal sleep and sexual routine, I don?t use any medications whatsoever even Tylenol or ibuprofen. I have no pre existing conditions. I have no history of heart or cardio problems. My family has a history of low blood pressure. I have next to no stress or anxiety in my life. I am 24 years old I work out and run miles, five to six days a week. I don?t use nicotine, tobacco, and I haven?t had a drink of alcohol in ten years (14yrs old). I smoke marijuana on a daily basis. After about ten minutes the incident went down and I was able to breathe a little better but still had pain and tightness in my chest. I have had shortness of breath ever since. This is being written the day after the event about 26 hours later. I ran a mile last night and went to the gym it seemed to help both my breathing and the pain and tightness but it has not fully gone away. I feel my heart straining somehow as I am typing this. One thing to note is I did not want to get vaccinated but was pressured to do so, and before getting it I was very nervous and honestly upset. The woman administering it was not helpful at all and actually mocked my unsureness and was very rude and unprofessional. She didn?t answer any technical questions I had. During my interaction with her between my nerves and her behavior I?m absolutely certain my heart rate was elevated at the time of getting the shot. I have only had one shot. The episode of  myocarditis occurred two weeks after my first shot. Two days after my scheduled second shot, which I missed because of work and was going to reschedule before this occurred. I am not going to be getting the second shot. Will be following up with my primary care doctor as soon as possible. Haven?t had time.

                                                Right shoulder pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 25-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 22Dec2020 at a single dose as preventative and to protect the people around him. The patient had no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient stated that ever since he got the vaccine, he has had shoulder pain (onset date was on 24Dec2020). He was unsure if it was joint or muscular. When he raises it to a certain level, there was intense pain. This was only his right shoulder, he got the vaccine on his left side. The pain had stayed the same. It goes away every so often and then it comes back, that was with him helping it. He had used heat, taking Advil, and sometimes icing it. It had stayed the same and it has not gone away and it has not improved. The patient thinks his dose was 3mL, if he can recall. He stated that he did have one question. He was about to resume classes at his college and they were requesting that he took a tetanus shot and get a TB skin test. He was trying to figure out if that was okay. He remembers reading something that he should not get another vaccine at this time. If that was true, the patient was inquiring what was the time span. Outcome of the event was not recovered/not resolved.

                                                On December 16th, I received my 1st dose of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine at 11:49am. I was off of work for the remainder of the day and driving to an appointment at a different town. Between towns, during the drive fatigue settled in and I started to get drowsy. I switched seats and fell asleep for some time in the vehicle. I had fatigue for about 3-4 weeks following the 1st dose. On December 23rd, my symptoms started to get worse. Headaches increased, muscle pain/aches, chills, fatigue and this was the first day I had a temp of 100.4. I took some Tylenol and it made it bearable for me to continue to work throughout the day. From 12/20-26/2020, I kept feeling like I had a cold or the flu. Through the Holiday, I remained in bed and didn&#39;t have energy to do anything. I still had all the symptoms and decided on December 28th to call into work and get seen for a Telehealth. Some lab work were done and test results came back. I&#39;m still working with my provider on figuring out what&#39;s going on with me.

The fatigue gradually increased throughout the day. I attempted to go to bed around 11:00pm and I was so cold my entire body was shivering to a point where my whole body was shaking. I also began noticing muscle cramps throughout my body as well, primarily located in my calves. Eventually fell asleep around 2:00am (symptoms were preventing me from falling asleep), when waking up noticed the symptoms had resolved.

                                                I, the patient am reporting this after speaking with my neurologist today, after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine I starting experiencing excruciating migraines, migraines that felt like when I was NOT treated for my chronic migraines. Prior to the vaccine I had been stable on topiramate and was only experiencing about 1-2 migraines a month and was fine with sumatriptan. However, after the first dose of the vaccine I experienced muscle pain across my arms/shoulder/shoulder blades/neck that attributed to my head hurting. This pain has not subsided since the second dose but has decreased in its severity. Basically, the pain is still there, but it is not as excruciating. I am able to still go about my day, and I no longer have the arm/shoulder pain, but the migraines have not gone away. After speaking to my neurologist, he feels that the vaccine most likely triggered the muscle pain as that is a very common reaction which spiked the migraines to resurface, which is why I wanted to report this AE, especially because it has caused my prophylactic treatment (topiramate) and acute treatment (sumatriptan) to BOTH fail and I am needing to have my medications readjusted in order to deal with these migraines that have not subsided over the 3 weeks since the first vaccine. My neurologist feels that these migraines MAY subside, but he cannot rule out that they may never and I may need new/stronger therapy for them.

                                                Soreness under left armpit on the second day of the vaccination; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 25-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9244), via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 15Feb2021 at 17:00 (at the age of 25-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included haemophilia, congenital emphysema, pneumothorax, and allergy to adhesives on foot, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 16Feb2021 at12:00, the patient experienced soreness under left armpit on the second day of the vaccination. It got better, and then got worse on the 7th day following the vaccination. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. The clinical outcome of soreness under left armpit on the second day of the vaccination was not recovered.

                                                Around 6 pm the same day of first pfizer vaccine (3/18/21), i woke up from a nap and my back hurt so bad that i couldn&#39;t leave the bed without falling out. My parents came and helped me out and gave me painkillers but really nothing helped. Next day, it started down my right arm (the arm NOT injected with the shot) and it started to hurt in my muscles everywhere and hasn&#39;t stopped to this day (3/25/21). Numbness and pins and needles feeling have occurred in my pinky and ring finger of right arm. Pain has now started in my knees as well after a few days from the shot. No pain killers work and I&#39;m unable to write or type properly, or even work at my job frankly. I can&#39;t hold an object without it falling out of my hand, and when i am able to hold something, after about 2 seconds pain fills my arm. Nothing helps the pain. I saw my primary care physician on 3/25/21 and the PA said there wasn&#39;t anything to do for the intense pain i was having except take tylenol arthritis, melatonin (to help me sleep through the pain), exercise (even though it may cause me even worse pain), and a stress ball for my arm. I don&#39;t know what else to do with this pain and this was only the first round of shots.

Symptoms included headache, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, feeling feverish, and itching on torso, arms, and legs . Symptoms seemed to improve over the next week or two before worsening again on 3/27/21 around 10:00 am. On the day of 3/27 /21 I experienced headaches, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, muscle aches, diarrhea, and vision problems. Currently on 3/30/21 symptoms have improved but I am still experiencing dull headaches and brain fog, as well as itching on torso, arms and legs and some vision problems.   I have not seen a provider  for these issues but have an appointment scheduled for 3/31/21. Treatment includes ibuprofen as needed.

The patient experienced 104 degree fever with vomiting, dizziness and extreme muscle joint pain. We explained to him that we noticed the dose he was given had been diluted improperly and he had received a slightly higher than normal dose.   I apologized for the incident and he said ?it?s ok?, and that now he knew why he was so sick.  He was very pleasant and appreciative of us trying to contact him over the weekend.   He was encouraged to contact us with any questions or if any new symptoms arise.   We also offered to have one of our providers contact him to discuss further, but he declined.

                                                On Wednesday April 14th I got my second vaccination shot. The following day I had a 103 F fever, body aches, chills, migraine, sore muscles, couldn&#39;t walk, excessive thirst. Those effects lasted all day and I felt better on Friday. Saturday night chest pain started along with sore arm getting worse. I took ibuprofen and melatonin to sleep. Woke up Sunday morning and pain came back and gradually got worse until I went into the ER around 9 am. They gave me Morphine to put the chest pain at bay. Then transferred me by ambulance to a different hospital with a cariology department. They treated me as if it was Myocarditis and also got an x-ray of my chest. The next morning I had an MRI and that is what confirmed it to be Myocarditis. I was then discharged with lots of medications to keep the inflammation down.
