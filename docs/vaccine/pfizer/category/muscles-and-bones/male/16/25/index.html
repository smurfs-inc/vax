On the day prior to arrival he developed increasing shortness of breath particularly with talking and with ambulation.  He also describes chest tightness with deep inspiration, the tightness radiates to back, no radiation to left arm or jaw.  Chest tightness is non-positional, but does feel worse immediately after he lies down from ambulation and then slowly dissipates.  His last subjective fever was yesterday evening.  He has never had a reaction to the vaccine before.  He has no allergies.  No prior medical conditions he is aware of, and takes no medications.  He did not experience any of the symptoms following the first vaccine. He has h/o asymptomatic COVID infection in November 2020. Cardiology consulted for concern of pericarditis post COVID-19 vaccine. He does not have significant ST elevation or PR depression.  He also does not have evidence of significant pericardial effusion at this point.  The high sensitivity troponins are mildly elevated.  He does have viral syndrome.  Is unclear if Covid vaccination was causally related to his symptoms.  We would like to improve his medications for better chest pain control and to prevent recurrent pericarditis in the future.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The vaccine was administered to the writer at 0800 on 1/5/2021. No immediate reactions were noticed for the 30 minutes observation period immediately after. The writer&#39;s muscle that received the vaccine began to become increasingly sore throughout the day; however, that was similar to the first dose of the same vaccine a few weeks prior. The pain was described as constant (2/10) but aggravated with motion. The pain did interfere with the writer&#39;s normal range of motion (specifically raising the writer&#39;s arm above shoulder height). From 0800-2200 on 1/5/2021 no noticeable symptoms except for the injection site pain occurred.   At 2200, the writer rapidly developed chills, body aches, a headache, fatigue, and a fever of 100.8. These symptoms were left untreated and continued through the night (the symptoms did not interfere with sleep). The writer woke up at 1300 on 1/6/2021; all previous symptoms had resolved by this time except for the injection site pain. By 1400 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed pain near the right axillary lymph nodes. The pain can be described as moderate (1/10) and generally occurred only with motion. The writer was unable to palpate any swelling in the area. Around 1800 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed it felt weird to swallow. Specifically, it felt as if there was a slight internal swelling 1-inch subhyoidally and 1-2 inches laterally within the right side of his neck when he swallowed. The swelling was not palpable from the skin&#39;s surface. The writer did not seek medical attention as breathing/eating/drinking were not made more difficult but monitored this closely. The swelling in the neck resolved by 2000 on 1/6/2021. The lymph node pain in the right arm resolved over the course of a few days and was no longer present by 1/9/2021 at 1300.

Upon waking at 0900 on 1/6, chills and shaking decreased to mild severity, muscles still felt moderately weak and shaky, headache had increased in severity to a severe throbbing pain that worsened upon standing and walking, and moderate visual photosensitivity began. The headache persisted until I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen 200 mg, which is when the severity decreased to moderate after a few hours and then mild by bedtime. The photosensitivity persisted through the day and did not decrease much by bedtime.   Upon waking 1/7, there was only a mild headache and mild photosensitivity that faded completely within a few hours, no medication required. No more symptoms in the afternoon.

A 21-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number and expiry date not reported) on 14Jan2021 10:00 at single dose intramuscularly in right arm for COVID-19 immunization. There were no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient started experiencing muscle ache and joint pain around 21:00 or 22:00 on 14Jan2021 and then he ran a low fever like a 100.5, and had chills pretty much all throughout the night. The patient noticed that those are common side effects but he had main concern on his work that he was unsure if he was okay to work on 15Jan2021. The chills and fever were gone on 15Jan2021 but he still had the muscle ache and tenderness. He stated that on 15Jan2021 the muscle ache and joint pain was about the same, it&#39;d gotten a little better compared to what it was throughout the night, mild. The patient took two ibuprofen (ADVIL). The patient was recovering from the muscle ache and joint pain. The events low fever, chills were resolved on 15Jan2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                ED Visit 3/11/21 History of Present Illness 21 year old man pmhx of autism, recurrent abscesses, presents with complaint of L axilla swelling and drainage. Pt received COVID vaccine in L arm on 3/1. Pt did well until 3/5 when he started to complain of pain in the L armpit. Mother examined the area and did not see anything concerning. The pain continued through the weekend, no fevers. Pt felt warm on Monday, no temperature taken. Mother then noted a few &#34;bump&#34; near the L armpit. The bumps continued to swell and be painful on Tuesday, went to pediatrician and was prescribed Keflex. Pt has been taking Keflex but continues to spike fevers, Tmax 102F on Wednesday. Pt had fevers yesterday and today of &#34;about 100.&#34; Pt took a nap today, and woke up with the area draining. Mother states that the drainage was smelly pus. Called PCP who recommended evaluation. ED course: Patient observed in the emergency department of antipyretics and did not have any further fever.  I will switch his treatment to clindamycin and provide topical bacitracin and provide strict criteria to come back if pt became febrile instructions provided to mom.   Patient safe for discharge to home. Discharged in improved condition. Written instructions reviewed with family.  3/18/2021 Discharge Summary History of Present Illness 21yo man with h/o autism and multiple soft tissue infections including cellulitis and pilonidal cyst who presented to the ED 3/13/2021 after axillary drainage and fever.  He had been treated outpatient with keflex, but continued to have fevers at home. Re-evaluated at ED and placed on clindamycin. Cultures from outpatient showing skin flora. Mother has been doing several dressings of drainage at home and ongoing fevers up to 102 so was brought to the ED for evaluation. No cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, recent travel, known sick contacts.  Summary of hospitalization: He re-presented to ED on 3/13/2021 and was started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. A CT scan with contrast done to determine extension of abscess, which was fortunately limited to the subcutaneous plane (no infiltration near bone or into muscle fascia). In the ED, patient&#39;s creatinine was 1.5. Patient received IVF and his creatinine downtrended to 0.75 on 3/18/21.   The surgical course was uneventful. Successful debridement of the left axillary abscess was performed on 03/4/21. Wound cultures grew Actinomyces Europaeus and S. Epidermidis and Infectious Disease was consulted. Their antibiotic recommendations to discontinue the cefepime/flagyl and start vanc/CTX were followed. Sensitivity analyses showed S. Epidermidis was sensitive to linezolid, tetracyclin, tigecyclin, bactruim and vancomycin. The Actinomyces Europaeus sensitivities have not yet resulted at time of discharge. Per ID recommendations, the vanc and CTX were discontinued and oral doxycycline was started, which should be continued for 6 months. It could be considered to switch to PO amoxicillin after 2 weeks and finish the 6 month course with amoxicillin. This will be discussed during outpatient follow-up. Per ID recommendations, the following labs should be checked 2 weeks after discharge (on 3/29/21) and could be spaced out to every 4 weeks thereafter if normal: CBC with differential, CRP, ESR, BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT.  The patient is scheduled to see (ID) on 5/5/21. Dermatology was consulted per ID recs for evaluation of spots on the chest and back. Per dermatology these spots are keloid, not suspicious for hidradenitis suppurative, there is no need for biopsy. For pilonidal cyst spot dermatology recommends rec hibicleans cream. Immunology was consulted for recurring abscesses and recommended the following tests, which were ordered, in addition to outpatient followup: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, specific Ab titers: for strep pneumo IgG (23 serotypes) and tetanus IgG, lymphocyte subsets, T cell memory panel, B cell memory panel, neutrophil DHR, CH50.  A wound VAC was placed on the left axillary wound bed on 03/15/21 and exchanged on 3/17/21.  Patient tolerated the wound vac changes well with 5mg of oxycodone taken 1 hour prior to the vac change. On 03/18/21 patient was discharged with a home wound vac and VNA.  At the time of discharged patient was afebrile, his pain was well controlled, his oxygen saturations were &gt;94% on room air, he was tolerating a regular diet and voiding/stooling without issues.

I slept from 9:00am to 2:00pm where the symptoms had gotten no better and the headache had gotten worse. I slept from 3:00pm to around 6:00pm with the same symptoms but managed to eat some soup and kept it down. I slept from 10pm to 12pm the next day 12/10/20.

                                                I had injection site pain about 4 or 5 hours after my injection. Around 9:15 at night I felt slightly warm and could tell that I was becoming febrile, but I wasn&#39;t completely there yet. Around 12:45AM on January 9th, I had massive chills and uncontrollable shivering and muscle aches. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I took another 1000 mg of acetaminophen at 6:00AM when my chills came back. At 10:45AM I was feeling febrile again, and took 600 mg of ibuprofen followed by an hour and a half nap. I had slight malaise afterwards but did not feel febrile. By 5PM, I was feeling almost completely normal and was fever free. On the morning of 1/10, I am completely recovered.

Did have some swelling and motor loss, NO CP, SOB or sensory loss, no redness, no injury, no fever, chills, ha, depression sore throat, cough, rash, lymphadenopathy, abd pain, GI distress, no trauma or recent illnesses. 2/21: admitted clinic w/rhabdomyolysis: no preceding workouts, increased activity on ship, back sleeper, no alcohol, no trauma,. nsp: skin intact, no erythema. Mild edema to upper arm around triceps. Mild purple discoloration to dorsum of hand. Palp: TTP about triceps. TTP anterior shoulder. TTP biceps. Able to palpate triceps tendon and biceps tendon. NTTP throughout the rest of hand and forearm. Hand is cooler relative to contralateral side. NTTP cervical spine. ROM: Full passive ROM of the shoulder and elbow with pain. No micromotion pain with any joint in the upper extremity. Painless cervical spine ROM. Motor: 3/5 strength to OP/FPL/2nd FDP, EIP/EPL, 1st and 2nd DIO. 3/5 deltoid, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors. Sens: Decreased sensation throughout entirety of forearm and hand distal to the elbow. Above the elbow, sensation is intact. Vasc: 2&#43; radial pulse, symmetric to contralateral side. BCR &lt;3 sec. Hand is cooler than contralateral side. Lab: CRP &lt;5, ESR 4, CK 31,924, PT 14, INR 1.1, D-dimer 0.46, AST 610, ALT 186, Cr 0.94, WBC 6.3 Imaging: Radiographs of the chest, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand demonstrate no fracture. The shoulder is well located. CTA starting at the heart demonstrate no vascular abnormalities. Assessment: unlikely that he has compartment syndrome or a cervical spine pathology. His exam does not localize to one specific innervation or muscle group. His paresthesias and diffuse 3/5 weakness on exam may be related to parsonage turner syndrome (post viral neuritis) versus edema. While he does have a cool hand and mild/moderate edema on exam, his CTA is normal and his exam is very reassuring that this is not compartment syndrome. He likely has rhabdomyolysis based on upper arm swelling in the setting of CK of 31924.   Discharge 2/22/2021: He received a total of 3 liters of IV fluids and was encouraged to drink large amounts of water. Repeat CK levels showed to be down trending as were his AST and ALT enzymes. Plain radiographs of his left arm and shoulder were unremarkable as was CT angiography of his chest. Electrolytes and renal lab work was within normal limits throughout the hospitalization.On the day of discharge, he was tolerating a PO diet, ambulating without difficulty, and hemodynamically stable. LUE w/ minimal swelling, no erythema. TTP over L triceps belly, No TTP over the distal LUE. Somewhat decreased sensation to light touch over distal LUE. 2&#43; radial pulses b/l. LUE ROM somewhat limited 2/2 pain, but intact. ---- to f/u with HCP in 2 weeks, sooner if worse (medical officer)   CK 2/22/21 was down to 14653

                                                Got woken up by intense leg pain around 6:00am the day following vaccination. I took 1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen (split between 2 pills each containing 500mg methocarbamol and 200mg ibuprofen), and 1000mg acetaminophen before a hot bath which relieved pain enough to get back to sleep around 7am. I woke up again around 11am with similar extreme pain, took another set of  1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen , and 1000mg acetaminophen along with 5mg of hydrocodone left over from recent dental work. Pain subsided  until approximately 4:00pm when legs started to hurt again before getting to severe levels around 5pm (and so did the back of my neck which was the first neck pain experienced) so I took another set of 1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen , and 1000mg acetaminophen along with 5mg of hydrocodone  (which has helped ease discomfort again).   Leg pain is not sharp but very persistent and painful and is located behind both knees.  Neck pain was sharp and located directly at the back. I have had no arm pain or injection site swelling or pain, just leg pain and neck.   I did not experience any side-effects after my first dose, not even injection site pain.

                                                Woke up approximately 14 hours after receiving dose #2 with body fatigue. My large joints (e.g., hips, knees, elbows, shoulders) started to develops aches/discomfort. A hot shower helped relieve the initial discomfort, and I took 1g of APAP ~45 minutes after waking up. I then reported to work, which is an ambulatory care clinic that is working a drive-up clinic. As such, I had to work outside in ~20F weather. I had 4 layers on my upper body and 2 layers on lower body with wool socks. The cold did not bother me for the first two hours as I was able to return to a warm area between patients; however, as work became busy, I spent more time outside. The aches/discomfort in my joints progressively worsened as well as the general bodily fatigue. I took another 500mg of APAP, but it did not help much more. Eventually, the cold and body fatigue made breathing uncomfortable, and my breathing became slightly labored. Returning to the warm environment helped the symptoms not get worse, but focusing on tasks became slightly difficult. I returned home at approximately 1630, took another 1g of APAP, and proceeded to sleep from ~1730 until 0530 the next morning. I woke up feeling much better.

                                                Nausea and Headaches occurred about 5 hours after the injection, since then they have come and gone periodically, usually lasting about 30 minutes, then going away for a few hours. I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

                                                On December 16th, I received my 1st dose of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine at 11:49am. I was off of work for the remainder of the day and driving to an appointment at a different town. Between towns, during the drive fatigue settled in and I started to get drowsy. I switched seats and fell asleep for some time in the vehicle. I had fatigue for about 3-4 weeks following the 1st dose. On December 23rd, my symptoms started to get worse. Headaches increased, muscle pain/aches, chills, fatigue and this was the first day I had a temp of 100.4. I took some Tylenol and it made it bearable for me to continue to work throughout the day. From 12/20-26/2020, I kept feeling like I had a cold or the flu. Through the Holiday, I remained in bed and didn&#39;t have energy to do anything. I still had all the symptoms and decided on December 28th to call into work and get seen for a Telehealth. Some lab work were done and test results came back. I&#39;m still working with my provider on figuring out what&#39;s going on with me.

                                                Right shoulder pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 25-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 22Dec2020 at a single dose as preventative and to protect the people around him. The patient had no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient stated that ever since he got the vaccine, he has had shoulder pain (onset date was on 24Dec2020). He was unsure if it was joint or muscular. When he raises it to a certain level, there was intense pain. This was only his right shoulder, he got the vaccine on his left side. The pain had stayed the same. It goes away every so often and then it comes back, that was with him helping it. He had used heat, taking Advil, and sometimes icing it. It had stayed the same and it has not gone away and it has not improved. The patient thinks his dose was 3mL, if he can recall. He stated that he did have one question. He was about to resume classes at his college and they were requesting that he took a tetanus shot and get a TB skin test. He was trying to figure out if that was okay. He remembers reading something that he should not get another vaccine at this time. If that was true, the patient was inquiring what was the time span. Outcome of the event was not recovered/not resolved.

The fatigue gradually increased throughout the day. I attempted to go to bed around 11:00pm and I was so cold my entire body was shivering to a point where my whole body was shaking. I also began noticing muscle cramps throughout my body as well, primarily located in my calves. Eventually fell asleep around 2:00am (symptoms were preventing me from falling asleep), when waking up noticed the symptoms had resolved.

                                                Soreness under left armpit on the second day of the vaccination; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 25-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9244), via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 15Feb2021 at 17:00 (at the age of 25-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included haemophilia, congenital emphysema, pneumothorax, and allergy to adhesives on foot, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 16Feb2021 at12:00, the patient experienced soreness under left armpit on the second day of the vaccination. It got better, and then got worse on the 7th day following the vaccination. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. The clinical outcome of soreness under left armpit on the second day of the vaccination was not recovered.

My parents came and helped me out and gave me painkillers but really nothing helped. Next day, it started down my right arm (the arm NOT injected with the shot) and it started to hurt in my muscles everywhere and hasn&#39;t stopped to this day (3/25/21). Numbness and pins and needles feeling have occurred in my pinky and ring finger of right arm. Pain has now started in my knees as well after a few days from the shot. No pain killers work and I&#39;m unable to write or type properly, or even work at my job frankly. I can&#39;t hold an object without it falling out of my hand, and when i am able to hold something, after about 2 seconds pain fills my arm. Nothing helps the pain. I saw my primary care physician on 3/25/21 and the PA said there wasn&#39;t anything to do for the intense pain i was having except take tylenol arthritis, melatonin (to help me sleep through the pain), exercise (even though it may cause me even worse pain), and a stress ball for my arm. I don&#39;t know what else to do with this pain and this was only the first round of shots.
