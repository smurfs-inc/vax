A contactable consumer reported for herself. A 90-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3248) via an unspecified route of administration in right upper arm on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery on her left shoulder about 15 years ago and it was perfect and it didn&#39;t bother her anymore, atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) and so taking blood thinners (unspecified medications) and had trouble with the shoulder. Concomitant medications included blood thinners (unspecified medications). The patient experienced her shoulder hurt after being vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine in Jan2021. The patient took two Tylenol Extra Strength and arthritis pill because yesterday on 17Jan2021, it just had flared up. And also, this was not the first time she had trouble with the shoulder. So, the patient was not sure, she have had problems with it before. The patient did not visited a Physician&#39;s Office or Emergency Room, she had a shot (Unspecified Medications) about 5 years ago when it was hurting her so bad and it hadn&#39;t bothered her much since but every now and then it flares up. So, it just may be a clear coincidence. The outcome of event was unknown.

Caller clarified that she couldn&#39;t even eat the 2 French fries and hasn&#39;t had anything since then. For loose bowels: caller reported that she had a urine problem and urinates often since an unspecified date. Caller stated that when she went to urinate and when she barely presses down, she would have a bowel movement, but it was very watery and loose, not a formed bowel movement. She talked to her cancer doctor and her regular doctor who both told her to go to the hospital but she did not go. For dry voice: caller reported that she didn&#39;t know if it was acid coming up in her mouth or just dry mouth. Caller didn&#39;t know what it was, if she kept her mouth closed and didn&#39;t talk and didn&#39;t get any air, it was not as bad. Caller reported that trying to talk was bad and it had recently gotten a little worse. The patient wasn&#39;t having these symptoms before she took the vaccine. The outcome of &#34;she doesn&#39;t know what she weighs, it is going down so fast&#34; and &#34;she has a urine problem and urinates often&#34; was unknown, the outcome of other events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                She got her 2nd vaccine, and almost immediately into her shoulder had pain in her shoulder blade and into her neck and had a lymph node on the right side of her chin/upper neck, then she has another one that is smaller and back further, and possibly a third one that is almost to the right side of her neck, tiny in nature.  None on the left side at all.  She felt that they would eventually go away and didn&#39;t do anything about it.  She went to see her Dr., and he did a neck scan on 4/7/21, and reported that it was not cancer and told her to watch it, but if they were there in 4 months that they would have to be removed, they are still there.    They have not changed in size.  She has not gotten any more either.  She definitely can feel the two and the third one is there but tiny.   Her arm is still very sore at the site of the shot at the muscle.  Almost daily at the site it gets very very sore and she gets chills and has to lie down due to exhaustion that lasts about 40 minutes and has to go lay down and then she gets back up once the chills pass.   She was having it every day at noon almost every day, and still continues pretty much on a daily basis, but the arm is still very sore.

Blood pressure, pulse and respiration were absolutely normal. But she was unable to speak for the rest of the day, she would open her mouth but could not get any words out. She also was extremely fatigued and slept most of the day, had no grip in her hands and was very stiff when she was able to get up. Had a slight fever, which went down after taking 1/4 of a Tylenol.  No pain in the arm at the injection site and also no redness or swelling.  So the know side effects of fatigue and muscle/joint pain hit her very hard.   She is much better today, 24 hours after experiencing the side effects.

This 91-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included high blood pressure, kidney cancer, cancer in her bladder 20 years ago and coughing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), ascorbic acid (VIT C), losartan potassium for blood pressure, metoprolol succinate for blood pressure, amlodipine for blood pressure, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81). Patient had cancer in her bladder 20 years ago. That was taken care of. Had kidney cancer because her husband used to smoke and blow it in her face. Had rare type of kidney cancer. It was removed. Treated for bladder cancer. Patient has had no problem ever since and that was more than 18 years ago. Patient had a fever, headache, and was very tired. Burning up on side of the body and she got all wet. This was not normal and she felt like she was dying. Patient stated she had shingles and developed post herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had pain at the bottom of her foot but it was getting worse after she received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Patient noticed the liquid going thru arm to chest and in straight line to her leg, like a science fiction movie with an injection of some kind. The doctor thought the vaccine might have an impact on the nervous system and spike the symptoms of post herpetic neuralgia. Patient spoke to her doctor but nobody knows anything. Nobody was willing to help her. Patient felt like she was dying. She didn&#39;t want to die. Patient feel the symptoms are getting worst. She was burning up inside. Her pain was around the bottom of the foot now it&#39;s on top of the foot and goes up to knee. Patient was not blaming anybody but she thought it was the vaccine. Patient was sweating, wet, perspiring all night. The symptoms usually occur at night. Patient wanted to know if these symptoms were associated with the vaccine. Patient also mentioned she developed a bladder infection for which she was taking antibiotics. Patient had Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021, about 5 days ago. Patient followed instructions before vaccine. Doctor said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) before the vaccine for a headache. Patient did that. Patient had injection and told to wait for 15 minutes before she went home. About 5 minutes, she was relaxed and sitting down. Vaccination given in left arm. All of a sudden she had a very strange feeling in her body on 02Feb2021. Something was going across the top and right side like a fluid was flowing or something strange. Then it felt like a straight line down her right foot and it stopped. Was a feeling like maybe the liquid of the vaccine went that way. Didn&#39;t have a vein going that way. Patient was afraid. She went home and didn&#39;t remember the next thing that happened. Every night she has gotten more sick. Patient had a feeling in her foot where she had shingles a few years ago. After shingles had post-herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had burning on bottom of her foot and would put it in ice water. Patient could handle that because it was just uncomfortable. After injection, she got so bad, the post-herpetic neuralgia was on her whole foot and it started to burn. It went up a little towards the knee or higher. Yesterday, at times, it quickly went over to the left leg. Patient had a fever every day and every night. Patient took paracetamol to cut the fever. Patient was coughing on call but stated that was nothing and the coughing was something she had. Every night she felt like her body was burning up in side. Felt like she was burning alive. Got all wet with perspiration. She changed clothes and every night it got worse. Patient called emergency, they listened to her, stating they have never heard of anything like this. Asked patient if she wanted to go to emergency. She stated ok. The doctor listened to her story and told her it was weird. Doctor told her to give it a few more days to up to eight days. Doctor wanted her to get a urine test, but she couldn&#39;t urine, patient tried for a long time in the bathroom and only got a few drops of urine out and it was brown. Not normal urine. Next day patient called 911. She wanted to be assured she was not dying at home. Did have room available at the hospital. Patient had to sit in a wheelchair and there was no bed for her to lie down in. Last time she was admitted from the emergency. Next day she came home and had to call emergency again. Really thought she was burning up. Patient didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital and suffered at home. Next night and third night was so bad. Patient couldn&#39;t urinate anymore. She had a fever, but not a high fever, because the paracetamol cut the fever. Temperature was 100 degrees. On the inside she thought she was being burned up a live. Never got better, always got worse. Yesterday, she was in the hospital all day. Now she has an infection in her bladder. Was put on a machine and everything. Had a long procedure, and got the urine going. Patient didn&#39;t miss not urinating. Has accidents like when she sneezes or cough. Usually gets up 2-3 times at night to urinate. When she finally realized she couldn&#39;t urinate, the doctor kept her there for a long time, eight hours. Was put on the machine, thought she may need a catheter. Her bladder was massaged in order to get her to urinate. Patient only had the left kidney. Correct problem about the urine. Doctor told her to make sure she goes back for second dose on 23Feb2021, but she was afraid. In the morning she was a little better, couldn&#39;t handle this. Patient was very weak and tired. One night she was in the emergency and didn&#39;t sleep because of the procedures. Patient didn&#39;t think the needle went in all of the way when the nurse administered her vaccine. Sensation started on the left, went across her chest, straight down like an arrow. Like something was trickling down to the end of her foot and stopped. Patient had symptoms every night since. So severe patient thought she was burning up. Patient got worse every night and didn&#39;t get any better. Patient said feeling at COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was not a natural thing. Last time she was in the hospital her blood pressure went up to 184. After COVID-19 Vaccine patient lost a little weight. Same time had this problem, was seeing a doctor with a colon specialty. Had so much constipation for a long time and tried to correct it with mediation. Medication was too strong and gave her diarrhea. Doctor thought maybe she had colon cancer. Stopped the medication. Wasn&#39;t 100% healthy, but that was just cramps. Patient eats very little now, not very hungry. Patient feels good in her bowels after something good from a restaurant. Patient attempted to clarify the medication that was too strong. She stated it was over the counter. She stated it was something that had to be mixed. She was supposed to take a cap full and mix it with 8 ounces of liquid. Needed something to make her have a bowel movement. Only took it for two days. Was way before the vaccine. It was too strong and she stopped it. Patient took a probiotic. After that patient was given gas relief medication called: Gas Relief Extra Strength Simethicone, 125mg. Provided: V11496, MSRS 53041 REV 0417, and 883928. Patient no longer has constipation. Now it is the opposite. Now bowel movements are soft and pasty. Patient tried a stool softener that didn&#39;t work, was worthless. Was over the counter. Patient didn&#39;t take stool softeners after the COVID-19 Vaccine. All the events started from Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 91-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included history of atrial fibrillation real bad where her heart has leaky valves and takes a lot of medicines. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included unspecified medications for atrial fibrillation which were considered as co suspects. Caller states she needs to know. She got the first Covid-19 vaccine yesterday (09Feb2021) and the nurse that had to put it in her, she felt it and it hurt. Her other friends said they couldn&#39;t tell they were getting a shot, but she did and it hurt. Where she went to get it was organized and wonderful and she got the shot about 12:00. Before it got to 6pm she was really aching there in her left arm and shoulder high up. Instead of a soreness she had pain. Had pain this morning and last night and didn&#39;t sleep good at all and couldn&#39;t even take off her pajama top. It was reported that she has history of atrial fibrillation real bad where her heart has leaky valves and takes a lot of medicines. She has some Tylenol in the house but does not know with her heart condition if it is alright to take the Tylenol for the pain or should she not take it. Has not taken any pain killers last night for fear of not knowing what it would do. The facility where she had the shot she was taken to since she does not drive and it was very well organized and all. Was very glad to get this vaccine and if people in the county can take it eventually it can be cured. Again, mentions having so many friends say they didn&#39;t have any problems and not to worry about getting the shot and she was filled with so much hope. The literature says you can have some joint pains and tiredness and her problem is wondering if she can take Tylenol to ease the pain. No further details provided. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number is requested.

Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 92-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered in Arm on 04Feb2021 at 12:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN5318) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetes, arthritis and thyroid, all three for 10 plus years; and bladder. Concomitant medication included ongoing methotrexate and meloxicam taken for arthritis; metformin taken for diabetes; mirabegron taken for bladder; and levothyroxine taken for thyroid, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient received the vaccine on 04Feb2021 (reported as last Thursday afternoon) and everyday since then her health has declined each day. She has more fatigue every day and lightheaded. Her immune system began to shut down (several blood draws taken). She just wanted little afternoon nap. On Saturday, she wanted to do very little &#39;aero&#39; (word not clear), very little just the minimum. She get up, she had a little breakfast, and as I live near a little pond, she watched the water and birds. And then yesterday, she slept probably five hours during the day and today that is all she has done, she got up and she does not want to eat, she took a nap, she changed chairs and she took a nap. She is now in her bedroom and taking another nap and this is not my mother. The patient was still alive but in failing health since the vaccine. The patient is now bedridden, lost 20 pounds (lbs) and was in constant pain. The patient was fine, walking and even dancing prior to vaccine.  The outcome of the events &#34;Her health has declined each day&#34; was not recovered while unknown for the other events. The patient died from vaccine on 15Mar2021. The autopsy was not done.  Follow-Up (02Apr2021): Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Failing health since vaccine

A 94-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (right arm) on 21Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE (arm right) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included left shoulder pain (on medication for years) from an unspecified date, and elbow that she fell on two weeks before on Jan2021. Concomitant medication included hydrocodone for left shoulder pain. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced real tired and she even slept 14 hours the night before. Reporter was wondering if tiredness is a side effect of the product. The patient also had an elbow that she fell on two weeks before on Jan2021, and three days after getting the vaccine (24Jan2021), that elbow started hurting more, and it was on the same arm as the side she got the injection on, the right arm. The reporter was unsure of the lot number reported as E13249 or EL3249 (unsure which lot number is his, and which is the one his wife received). The patient received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the event &#34;elbow starting hurting more, and it was on the same arm as the side she got the injection on, the right arm&#34; was not recovered. Outcome of events &#34;is real tired and she even slept 14 hours last night&#34; was unknown.

A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

She was born in that section of the hospital where she got her shot. Patient will contact her granddaughter in #and tell her what happened about her getting sent a card. She was reading in the paper, or book, that she was supposed to get another shot, but the caller doesn&#39;t know. She really doesn&#39;t want another shot, she&#39;s too old. She did good. Patient underwent lab test and procedures included weight. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information about batch/Lot number has been requested.
