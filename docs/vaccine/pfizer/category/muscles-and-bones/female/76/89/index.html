                                                I have had a sore left arm since receiving the first dose on 1/16. VAERS report was put in and e-confirmation 294505. First dose was given in the right arm but caused pain in the left arm. With the 2nd dose due to the pain in the left arm, I got the 2nd dose in the right arm. There was just a sting when they put in the needle in. Today 2/10/2012 around 2-3 am I woke up and my arm is swollen. It is a little discomfort when I move my right arm.

                                                Immediately, within 2 hours of the vaccination, I developed a severe headache, join pain (knees, elbows, mostly legs and lower extremities) which evolved into intense, burning abdominal pain.  My blood pressure rose to 160; however, there was no fever, cough or shortness of breath.  This condition lasted until the 7am on the morning of February 8th, but pains returned that evening (Monday 2/8) through Tuesday morning.  Symptoms subsided during the day on Tuesday, yet on Tuesday evening (2/9, approximately 48 hours after the injection), severe symptoms returned, similar to the initial evening.  I visited my Primary Physician on Wednesday afternoon (2/10) for a consult.

                                                One week after the first vaccine, I had severe pain in my right arm.  I could barely lift it. applied ice and pain lessened...Then other events followed...My left wrist became swollen and red. then a day later the severe pain was in my left arm and I could barely lift it.  I then had a swollen right foot.  Podiatrist gave me a shot of cortisone but continued to have the pain and swelling...Shoulder pain returned.   2nd vaccine was 02/03/2021...Feb 10...both hands were stiff and I couldn?t open them...Then the shoulder pain in my right arm returned .  This lasted 4 days...with the most severe pain.

Presented to MHN ED 2/2/21 @ 1100 for workup and initially declined admission and went home. Was called and asked to return for admission and further workup, admitted to MHN 2/2/21 @ 1750. Fever, myalgias, headache. CT abd/pelvis &#34;There is mild diffuse mesenteric edema surrounding the abdominal aorta and proximal branches. Additionally, there is mild bowel wall thickening involving the stomach without discrete mass. This is nonspecific and may represent infectious versus inflammatory changes.&#34; Per provider note &#34;flu-like sx over the weekend that easily coincide with the timing of the COVID Pfizer vaccine. In addition, I wonder if her CT scan findings might also be related to the vaccine.&#34; Discharged home the next day.

Diarrhea only lasted about 1 day, but fatigue ( which demanded many naps) and achey body lasted until Monday night.

Today is Thursday and I am still quite tired, lower sore back ache.   Never had a fever.

Had to grab on to something due to a feeling that I was going to fall. It lasted just a quick second or two.  Happened several times that day.  Like what I would think a TIA would feel like.

I attempted to report this on line at instructed on forms given me when I left the site. however the CODE that was to be sent to my phone never came. I then entered the wed site and attempted to report it there. .  Finally I called my primary Dr and he has instructed me to report this to the person giving the second injection.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 76years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed in 1999; Covid-19 from 23Nov2020 to Dec2020 (went to the hospital because of pain in her side at night. Was told she had pneumonia and pleurisy, she got it 2 days after her husband did, but hers was a mild case); her husband had Covid in Nov2020 and died in Dec2020 and hemorrhoids (from having babies years ago). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient scheduled her first dose for 27Dec2021. The patient had questions about it, but the person administering it did not speak English and she said that initially she did not have any reactions while she was there. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 27Feb2021 and has a lot of adverse events. After the getting the shot, she woke up at 0400 and experienced shaking (whole body was shaking), trembling out of control, hurting from her neck down to her toes, her joints were achy, hurt, and stiff, her teeth were chattering and couldn&#39;t stop, and when she tried to stop that it made it worse, when she got up she had hard time walking, so much that when she had diarrhea, she had diarrhea on the floor, she also noticed that the color of the diarrhea looked red and looked like it had blood on it but she was not sure. After that, she sat down in a chair and noticed that it had blood when she got up and suspected that she had hemorrhoids and bleeding because of the diarrhea. She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

She was not worried she had COVID. She had no breathing problems and did not feel like she was going to pass out. They said she should wait 48 hours and take a test to see if she had COVID. She did and it was negative. She does not feel any negativity toward the vaccine. She went in for a bladder infection and it was from a doctor&#39;s appointment that she got information and they told her she could go ahead and get it. Since she got the vaccine, she got white bump in the vicinity of the vaccine like a while mole, and another in the vicinity of the area as well. It does not itch or hurt. She noticed it about a week after the shot. She does not know the date. She was still on medication for a bladder infection but it would not have done anything. When she had reaction to the vaccine, it was already 10 days after she got the shot. She had asked them at Kaiser, and they think it was unrelated to any other medication. Outcome of event fever was recovered on 01Feb2021, for white bump near injection site was not recovered and recovering for all other events.

Got up about 2AM to go to the bathroom; started back to bed; had a bad taste in mouth, so decided to brush my teeth.  Started brushing and all of a sudden, felt faint; before I could get the toothbrush back, I fell and my husband rushed over. Said I was out completely; got me awake and back up and went to bed and slept. until 11am.   At 3pm when taking a shower, noticed my left shoulder blade was real sore and looked and there were 3 red strips below should blade - no bleeding tho.  top R. side of head kinda sore, so must have hit when falling. Went back to bed and slept good.  Didn&#39;t need to go to the Dr. and am feeling good now.  Just rested for a couple days.  Had been feeling really good and don&#39;t take any prescriptions, so could only think it had to have something to do with the shot. Today is the 4th day and feel good.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I think I am having a bad reaction to my covid shots.  The first shot was 1/31; a week later on 2/7  I started having headaches that travel around my head: some are behind my eyes and my teeth ache;  some more like migraines that go up the back of my head; some more on the top of my head or on the side.  My sense of taste changed.  My second shot was 2/27.  The day after I slept all day.  The headaches continued (I have had a headache of one kind or another since 2/7).  I had a tooth that broke off last June and was removed on March 8.  I thought the tooth was infected and part of the headache problems, but since then I have been having really bad fibro pain and for the week of 3/8- 12 I ran a fever, had chills and more headaches.  I was on amoxicillin from 3/8 to 3/14, but the tooth was not that badly infected and is healing well.  The headaches do not seem to relate to the tooth.  I have had a headache every day since 2/7 of various intensity and in different areas of my head.  I am extremely fatigued and need to nap some days.  My fibromyalgia symptoms are worse than they ever have been and some nights keep me awake.  I also muscle stiffness and spasms in my neck occasionally.  This is not normal for me. I saw a ARNP on 3/16 and she tested me for neurologic symptoms. Here are her notes:  NEUROLOGIC: negative findings: speech normal, mental status intact, cranial nerves 2-12 intact, gait, including heel, toe, and tandem walking normal, Romberg negative, muscle tone normal, muscle strength normal, rapid alternating movements normal, finger to nose normal, reflexes normal and symmetric   I have a video appointment with my primary care provider 3/26 to discuss this further

After the second she got very cold and felt miserable like her legs had weights on them- this only lasted 1-2 days. Then two weeks later she got a ring around the injection site- and developed intense itching, burning, and erythema and warmth at the site and axillary lymph node swelling.  The muscle on her arm were tender and swollen as well. The lymphadenopathy, and arm pain and swelling lasted for over a month.   Pfizer :  Lot: 12831/8/21 Lot 9261 1/25/21

A 76-year-old female patient received  the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9266, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 23Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history included stomach problem and bleeding problems in her stomach. There were no concomitant medications. The patient said that absolutely everything was okay until she went to get the shot, and was even okay the evening of the shot, then it went down hill from there. She said nothing she has that is related to the pain in her arm, or that she feels she should provide. She did not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient stated that the injection area was a little sore and the area became bigger and bigger by Wednesday (24Feb2021). She woke up on Thursday (25Feb2021) and her elbow and shoulder was in pain, described as a dull pain. The patient stated she has a stomach problem where she can&#39;t take medicine. She started treating her pain with aspirin cream with Lidocaine. She said that its kind of worked, it didn&#39;t take it away, but more manageable. Now it&#39;s been 6 days later (01Mar2021), it was reported a deep deep pain in the point she can&#39;t sleep at night. She can&#39;t position her arm in a way that is not painful. It was getting unbearable. It transferred from shoulder to her neck on Friday (26Feb2021). It got worse Thursday evening and has been the same since. Patient said, &#34;I am not going to get the second shot if this pain does not go away or if I am going to experience this again.&#34; The patient was calling about a possible side effect and was wondering if anyone else had it and does it go away. She was suffering, she wanted to know if the pain she is in, that she is still experiencing will go away. She said that she had a deep muscle ache pain to the point she can&#39;t sleep at night.  Patient stated that her pain began as soreness at injection site that started Wednesday and then it just got worse and worse and became deeper and deeper just between her shoulder and elbow, a deep constant achy pain. During the day when she is using her arm she can kind of forget the pain, but at night there was no comfortable position she can put her arm in without pain, so she has not been sleeping the last 3-4 nights, she can&#39;t sleep, she was miserable. She said she would rather get COVID than this, it was ridiculous. As she has bleeding problems in her stomach, she can&#39;t take anything to treat the pain, so she was trying to use lidocaine on her arm, which did at first give some relief but no longer works. She said that the only number listed on the bottle was next to &#34;EXP date, LOT: 19C506, EXP: Mar2021 (as reported).&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                is here today for ED follow-up on A-fib. Patient stated she is not taking Eliquis.    She had no side effects from her first COVID-19 vaccine. After the 2nd one she had muscle aches, headache, freezing cold, and &#34;weird&#34;, and felt really badly then at 9:30 PM, 32 hrs after the 2nd vaccine dose she felt the a-fib started. She had not been in a-fib in many years. Cardiology had already recommended eliquis but she was holding off. She had diltiazem from 2017 that she tried but with out relief. They rate controlled her but she remained in a-fib, started eliquis, and she went home. For 2.5 weeks she had headache and chest pain, other muscle pain, felt horrible, until she stopped the Eliquis.  Since stopping the Eliquis, she still has occasional mild chest pain, and headache, and flushing.   Her current chest pain is left chest, not radiating. The quality varies, stabbing pain in a very small location at times, may be associated with eating.   She did have a stress test years ago and was &#34;fine&#34;.   She had a dental appointment planned that she had to cancel, she has moved it to May 4th.

The muscle relaxant didn?t help and I didn?t do the p.t.  She offered to refer me to an orthopedist, which I declined.

A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 17Mar2021 13:50 (at 76-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. Medical history included hip replacement four years ago in 2017 (First right then 2 months later left) and knee replacement six years ago in 2015 (both 2 months apart). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6203), administered in Left Arm on 25Feb2021 (at 76-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced bad headaches. The patient received the second dose of vaccine on 17Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, she was not hurting and went to brunch with friends. Afterwards (on the same date, 29Mar2021), she was sitting and got the worst pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. She drove herself home but was in such misery. She went to the emergency room the next day, on 30Mar2021, wherein she had a CT (computerized tomography) scan that showed a blood clot in her lower abdominal area. She was taking pain medication every 6 hours, or she could hardly stand it. On 08Apr2021, she went back to the emergency room because she could hardly stand it. She was kept in observation status but was not admitted. She was scheduled to have another CT scan on 06May2021. She is not sure what they will do because the nerves are wrapped around it. She also mentioned that her doctor wants to do a biopsy. The pain was also running down to her ankle. She stated that she has had both of her hips replaced in the past. She added that her doctor will do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). He will put in a drain if it has not shrunk. The doctor can&#39;t do anything because the nerves are all tangled up (2021). As corrective treatment, the patient was taking pain medication for the blood clot and pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. Outcome of nerves are all tangled up was unknown, while outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscularly administered in the right deltoid on 30Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number: GR8732 or 6R8732 [as reported]; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure/hypertension; had breast cancer twice with the last time was in 2010 to unknown date which was 23 years later than the first time she had it (1987). She had infiltrating ductal cancer, stage one, that was HER-2 positive. She states that this is the most malignant breast cancer. She had to have extensive chemotherapy and also took Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. The overriding symptom from her cancer was extreme fatigue; has been in chronic fatigue syndrome and in bed for 7 years, she was getting over chemo and she can barely walk. She has trouble walking long distances; had a mastectomy from 2010 to an unknown date without lymph node dissection; had a central node dissection; took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine; ongoing anxiety, depression and nervousness which is not new to her. She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children&#39;s allergy medication. She took half of a children&#39;s dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother&#39;s sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother&#39;s sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn&#39;t feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn&#39;t do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn&#39;t want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after. The patient declined safety report, saying that she is stressed and anxious (2021), she just wants to be transferred for her question. The reporter considered the events fatigue aggravated serious and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as medically significant.

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL3249, expiration date: 31May2021) via unknown route of administration in right upper arm on 21Jan2021 at 11:00, at a dose of 0.3mL as a single dose for Covid-19 immunization in Hospital and received new refill of Mycophenolate mofetil, which is an immunosuppressant at a dose of 250mg, 2 capsules by mouth two times daily for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on the same day (21Jan2021). Medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic /chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity), kidney problem and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 30Jan2021, the patient experienced the dizziness, that started 10 days after the first dose of the vaccine and on the new refill of Mycophenolate mofetil and patient felt weird when she went for walk. On 01Feb2021, the patient was not feeling that great. Last Saturday (30Jan2021) and again today she felt some dizziness, felt weird, but did not think it can be blamed on the vaccine, or did that happen. She enquired whether that could also interact with the vaccine and had zero reactions until last Saturday. So, she wanted to check with Pfizer first and then with her kidney doctor. At that time, she was dizzy and could not shake it all that morning lone. Patient was on Mycophenolate mofetil for 2-3 years and it was a refill she just started on. With the timing right then with the dizziness wonders if related to the new batch she started that day. Unable to provide the NDC, Lot, or expiry for the Mycophenolate mofetil, but provided a discard date of 19Jan2022 from the white manufacture bottle and mentions (name) label over bottle. Mentioned that she does not take product as read on bottle it has been changed after discussion with the provider. Was using this prescription 2 in the morning and 1 at night and since she has been having the dizziness, she has switched to taking it 1 in the morning and 2 at night. Did read on the instructions that this can cause dizziness, but she had taken this stuff for over 3 years and was trying to figure out if it&#39;s a bad batch or not. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced headache and thinks she was shrunk and may have gained some weight. The outcome for the events dizziness, felt weird when went for walk, not feeling that great was not recovered and for headache, was shrunk and may have gained some weight was unknown.

As the day went on it got much worse and the nausea started to the point where my husband had to take me to the ER .  They gave me some pain medicine, nausea medicine and did a cat scan of my abdomen. Nothing was found and I was sent home. April 4th the pain got so severe and the dry heaving to the point where blood came out. Again I went into the ER this time by ambulance because I was so weak at that point where I couldn?t walk. Again they gave me pain medicine and nausea medicine along with prednisone. It took about a week to recuperate and now I have severe tinnitus.

No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Stated that she had a urinary tract infection and was put on antibiotics for 7 days. Two days after starting the medication, she came down with a rash. The patient husband, who was a family physician had never seen a rash like that in his 40 years of practice. In the newspaper, there was a woman who got the vaccination, but not sure if it was Pfizer, and had a rash; the article had a picture of the rash the woman had, after the vaccine. Patient stated that her rash looked worse than the woman in the newspaper. The rash happened after the second vaccine, several weeks later, but after the antibiotics. Patient was allergic to a lot of antibiotics. She stated she may have this problem, the rash because she was allergic to a lot of antibiotics.

She contacted the FDA and was told it would take 120 days for it to drop to a half dose in her system. She asked about contacting CDC to report it. She was so upset that this happened to her. The patient hair loss was almost gone now, her daughter said she had fuzzies instead of bald spots. She just had bloodwork a few weeks ago, and had regular meds she takes, but has been taking those for a couple years but they don&#39;t make a difference with the shot, she doesn&#39;t believe. Patient has psoriasis on legs and was taking a new drug her dermatologist provided and she called the FDA about this med and they said it could cause hair loss but probably not, her doctor said it was not the cause of it. Drug was Plaquenil, but she was taking the generic for that, she was taking hydroxychloroquine 200mg tablet by mouth once daily, she started, she believes 29Mar2021 for psoriasis on legs. She stopped it as soon as her hair was falling out, as she thought it was that originally, but her dermatologist said it was not, it was from the shot. Patient did not visit physician office but it was panic, she was crying for 2 weeks, her daughter informed there was nothing to do, it will just fall out. Patient informed that when she got the shots, she didn&#39;t have any kind of reaction, just the second, she had a little bit of muscle pain, but overnight it went away. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: unknown on an unspecified date. Outcome of the event hair loss was recovering and for muscle pain recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.  Follow up attempts are needed. Further information has been requested.

                                                She had high Blood pressure yesterday; Second dose administered on the Left Arm, her arm did hurt a little on 06Feb2021, the day she got this dose; started getting hungry; she was 127lbs, probably because of the swelling, but she is usually 119lbs or 118lbs; swelling under her eyes/eyes started getting swollen; face was swollen; Eye infection; face felt tight; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot: EM9810; NDC number: Not Provided Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 06Feb2021 at 8:31AM (at the age of 76 years), as a 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included disc protruding (diagnosed before the covid vaccine in Jun2020 or around that, she recalls having several months of MRI&#39;s in 2020) and high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included Epidural Shot (Verbatim) for Protruding Disc Patient on 27Jan2021 (she had to go to the doctor in the clinic and get epidural shot in the back at the disc thats protruding). Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot: EL3249; NDC number: Not Provided, Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 at 12 PM (noon) as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 76 years) for COVID-19 immunization. Clinical course: She took second dose of Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 06Feb2021, though she had no reaction initially. A week later from vaccination on Feb2021, she then began to notice her eyes started getting swollen couple days after, she then felt like her eyes felt like they were closing, then she saw her whole face was swelling, it looks like she had Chipmunk cheeks. She went to the doctor hoping it would go away, she was prescribed Benadryl and a decongestant as treatment. She takes Benadryl three times a day and the decongestant in the morning and her face is still swollen. It started with the eyes and the bag under the eyes, that was the first thing she noticed. She laughs and though she initially had an eye infection. She just wants to know if there is any other reports of this happening, or how to get rid of it, this has been there since she got her second dose on the 06Feb2021 since like 10Feb2021. After the second vaccine on 06Feb2021 around that time an hour later, she was on the way home and started getting hungry, she thought that was a symptom as well as her arm hurt a bit. She was starving till Monday got up 2AM, 6AM ate all day Sunday and Monday ate all day, as reported &#34;all she knows is she was craving a crab sandwich.&#34; Her Eyes swelling started a couple days later and the Face swelling was either the second week or same time, she just recalls looking at the eyes. She recalls telling her son her face felt tight in Feb2021. At the doctors appointment she was 127lbs, probably because of the swelling, but she is usually 119lbs or 118lbs, she is a small girl. The Appointment with the doctor was yesterday (15Mar2021), they prescribed Benadryl. Patient clarified that she was not Prescribed Zyrtec, it was a decongestant but she does not know the name of it. The Druggist however told her she could take another medication also. As reported &#34;The eye swelling and face swelling, at the moment she look like she been drunk, her face is plentiful, she is still swollen, her lids are not bad, but it is ongoing, it has gotten worse because prior she didnt even know it was there and its showing more now. She asked son if he thought she was swollen because she feels tight, over the weekend her face being swollen was noticeable, she is noticing people are pointing it out now.&#34; She adds her arm did not hurt with first dose. Second dose administered on the Left Arm, her arm did hurt a little on 06Feb2021, the day she got this dose and the next day (07Feb2021). She thought initially that she didn&#39;t have any side effects. She had High blood pressure yesterday (15Mar2021), but that usually goes up and down for her and nothing new. It was reported that, a week later, patient experienced swelling under her eyes, face was swollen, eye infection and face felt tight on Feb2021; hunger and vaccination site pain on 06Feb2021 (reported as the day she got this dose); hypertension on 15Mar2021 (reported as yesterday). Patient would like to know if swelling of the face is a reported side effect from the covid vaccine, how long her side effects from the covid vaccine will last and asking for suggestions on how to get rid of the side effects from the covid vaccine. The outcome of event vaccination site pain was recovered in Feb2021 (duration of event was 2 days), swelling under her eyes, face was swollen was not recovered while outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                Within a few days, I had some joint pain, headaches and fatigue. I was also disoriented. Those symptoms lasted 1 week to 10 days. I took Tylenol. This is long term issue (happening before the vaccine): Thyroid- I was going through a series of tests that the doctor was doing. My diet was changed and the medications were changing. I called the doctor most recently about Pinworm- went to see grandchildren and got that from them. They prescribed me Pinworm Medicine - the active ingredient is - Pyrantel Pamoate. I started taking that on June 10th. That&#39;s helping with my symptoms. I have to wash everything all the time. I have to repeat the Pinworm medication on the 24th of June.

No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As per the information provided in narrative, the events hernia repair, knee operation, Osteoarthritis is assessed as possibly related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 based on strong temporal association. The events hyperglycemia, joint range of motion decreased, peripheral swelling, and arthralgia is assessed as possibly unrelated to the suspect drug BNT162B2 since the reporter denies causality.

The patient stated, &#34;What are the side effects after the 2nd dose? I already have some muscle pain.&#34; The patient also denied having any problems or symptoms after yesterday&#39;s shot (as reported, pending clarification).

Could not warm up, had two down comforters on. The chills eventually stopped but the headaches Intensified, also I could. Or move my near and shoulders. Went to the ER, they did not believe it had anything to do with the shot, I was there for 12 hours, had head exrays, spinal taps to test for meningitis, they searched for anything else I might have...nothing else.. they would not say if I should have the second shot, called pfiser this morning, they could not tell me if I should have the second shot, that I should aske my doctor.......If Pfiser  doctor  does not know if it is safe how could  my country doctor.

E.g. turning my head to the left was very uncomfortable.   These symptoms lasted about two days -- by a week later they were gone   I used a hot pad and tylenol to become more comfortable.   Probably not a very significant issue, but it was uncomfortable,   I wondered if I perhaps had &#34;pulled a tendon&#34; or something like that.

A 77-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL3246, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 (around noon) at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetes, ongoing blood pressure high/blood pressure, ongoing heart problems; heart disease, kidney disease, history of itching, fluid (imbalance), stroke so taking for clotting, history of neck issues and she was allergic to a lot of medications. Ongoing concomitant medications included ubidecarenone (COQ-10), zinc, torsemide for fluid, clopidogrel for had a stroke so taking for clotting, insulin glargine (LANTUS) for diabetes and isosorbide mononitrate, carvedilol, irbesartan and amlodipine, all for blood pressure. Patient reported that she got the injection on Sunday and then later she started to get spasms on 12Jan2021. These spasms were like in her back where her shoulders were and it was bulging and it hurt from her neck and up into her head. She mentioned she was 77 years old and sometimes she has to think about a word before she gets it out, but yesterday (14Jan2021) it was different. It was like she went blank. She was looking around and she could not remember names she was trying to figure out name street on and this lasted 15 minutes and then it went away. She confirmed she does not have it right now. It did not last a long time, but it scared her so bad. Then yesterday evening (14Jan2021), she started to have funny chest pain. She told her husband if it did not go away she would go to the ER. However, after an 1 hour it went away. It was like a sticking pain. The chest pain lasted for an hour and started around 18:00. On an unspecified date, she started itching at night. She has a history of itching, but this was out the box. She had hives on the knee. It was crazy. She itched all over. She had to get out of bed and sit in a chair until 1:30AM. She was still itching, but it was not as bad. Patient reported that due to the kidney disease she has itching, but the itching she was having after this COVID Vaccine was different and more. It was out of the box. She confirmed this was the first injection and now she was scared to get the second injection. Patient reported that the itching started when she went to bed. She went to bed around 21:00 and around 21:30, she got out of bed because she was itching so bad. She stated there was not anything different on the bed. It was the same thing that was up there the night before. She did not change the sheets or anything. She had to get up and sit in a chair and she could not believe how bad her knee was itching. She was itching on her knee, leg, arm, neck, and ears. She stated she takes a lot of medications. She was very funny with medications and they have to work with her to get the right one for her. Due to having these other conditions was why she wanted to get the COVID Vaccine. She reported she will have her blood drawn next week. The two that had her most worried was the memory loss and chest pain. However, these passed and she did not go the ER or physician office. She was afraid if she gets the second injection this will happen again and she may not come out as well form it. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Outcome of events spasms/spasms were like in her back where her shoulders were and it was bulging and itching/itching on her knee, leg, arm, neck, and ears was recovering; chest pain was recovered on 14Jan2021 at 19:00; and outcome of the rest of events was unknown.

No breathing problems. 5th February 2021 Pfizer 1st dose CV19 vaccine.  Scary symptoms started in grocery store parking lot around 6PM (after vaccine at 8:35A) my legs felt like they were partially paralyzed and I would not be able to walk to the car.  I struggled to walk.  Got home and laid down.  Thought it was side effects to vaccine and it would pass if I went to sleep.  Woke up and felt totally paralyzed and it required a lot of effort to turn on my side to try to reach my phone.  All my muscles and joints ached.  I am never sick and not a complainer.

                                                This was my second vaccination at the same site.  I was fine with the first shot, and seemed fine with the second one until the next afternoon around 3:00 p.m.  All of a sudden I could feel some aching in the back of my neck and just a feeling of aching down my back.  Then I started to get the chills, chills that were so bad my body was almost convulsing with chills.  I ended up going to bed and I turned my electric mattress pad on to warm up.  I then slept very well and I don&#39;t think I moved all night.  I woke up sort of achy, but not much to be concerned with.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had anaphylactic shock in the past to a sulfur antibiotic. There were no concomitant medications. She stated she did not have an extreme reaction for the first 3-4 days, it was fine and went away. She had fatigue, joint pain, all the regular things and they were easing up. She had an appointment on the 20Jan2021 and thought things were going okay. On day 7, 20Jan2021, that night, she had an extreme reaction of blinding headache, the shakes, her whole body was shaking out of control for hours, her neck froze completely, and she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal (this is still occurring). The patient has had joint paint on 14Jan2021; extreme tiredness, weakness and muscle pain on 15Jan2021; chills, pain in her neck and muscles were so sore from 20Jan2021. She figured that was side effects, and she was handling, and then exactly a week after, she got the shakes so bad she shook for like 5 hours, she had to put nightguard in her mouth to stop from cracking, and severe headaches and her neck completely locked up, she couldn&#39;t move her head, and she still can&#39;t. She had extreme headache, and she went to the ER on 26Jan2021, since she was in really bad shape, they wouldn&#39;t believe her that it was a COVID reaction, she was there for 12 hours, they did every test, she had spinal taps, she had a head X-ray, everything, as they said she had meningitis, but then ruled that out, they wouldn&#39;t believe she was having a reaction to the COVID shot, she can&#39;t move her head, her joints and that are ok otherwise, but she can&#39;t move her head, she has pain in her neck, and she is taking Excedrin for that. She stated her doctor told her to go ahead and take the second dose of the vaccine and just take Tylenol after. She stated Tylenol has no effect whatsoever. If she takes Excedrin the headache will go away and Tylenol won&#39;t budge it. She stated she is taking Excedrin regardless of what the doctor says. When asked for age of onset, states she was on Valium and she was not thinking straight, and asked her husband her age. She was not sure why it was given, now provides name as Diazepam 5mg. Muscle pain is fine now, it went away. She went to the doctor on 20Jan2021, as she had a regular appointment for bloodwork to be done, and said she felt pretty good, she had some reaction but was fine, and that night is when she got shakes and shivers so bad, she had 3 quilts on and couldn&#39;t warm up, her body was out of control, she couldn&#39;t stop, now states for 3-4 hours. Severe headaches started the night of the 20Jan2021. Her neck pain started right after the shakes, so maybe she pulled muscles when she had the shakes, the muscles were so sore, and she couldn&#39;t move her head, like down or to the side, she couldn&#39;t move it, which is why she went to the hospital, to the ER. She was there for 12 hours. She started taking Excedrin, states she ignored what the doctor told her. She knows her body and she can take Tylenol and Ibuprofen like it is candy, and it does nothing, one Excedrin puts everything away, she swears by Excedrin. The outcome of the event shaking recovered on an unspecified date; Joint pain and Muscle pain recovered on 19Jan2021; Blinding headache/ severe headache, Fatigue/Extreme tiredness was recovering, chills/ shivers, couldn&#39;t warm up, Neck froze completely, pulled muscles, fatigue was unknown; she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal/ couldn&#39;t move her head, Pain in her neck, Muscles were so sore, Weakness was not recovered.

(injection given at 1452) The doctor suggested heat/cold, anti-inflammatory,  brace and finally an x-ray which indicated nothing.  Four days after the second injection I&#39;ve experienced mild pain in my opposite thigh and fatigue. The second injection was given in the opposite arm (left). While chatting with others  in recovery after second injection about knee pain, another woman said she was experiencing the same and thought it was her arthritis but it felt different.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthmatic, had double pneumonia years ago, has ongoing atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker to control it as the only problem she has in her heart. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient was hospitalized for 2.5 days after having symptoms of a massive heart attack two days after the vaccine. It was reported that two days post vaccination, the patient was rushed to the hospital by ambulance as they thought she was having a massive heart attack. She added her symptoms lasted for hours, she had pain so bad that she was bent over and had a little trouble breathing. She said the pain was in the heart and underneath the rib, on the left side. She later mentioned she did not feel like it was AFib. She said they did every test possible and listed the following ones: ultrasound, stress test, x-ray (unknown results), and blood work in Feb2021. She specified that her blood work indicated a blood clot. She mentioned she was told by her personal friend, who was a doctor, that by having the shot sometimes it indicated you have blood clots when you really don&#39;t. The patient also specified that she broke out in a sweat, the pain was so severe that she  could not bend over and could not get up; therefore, they treated her as if she was having a massive heart attack for 12 hours at the hospital. It was reported that they kept giving her stuff to stop the effect with her heart.  She mentioned her second dose was scheduled on 25Feb2021. She asked if her experience was reported as a side effect to the vaccine and should she get the second dose of the vaccine. She explained the doctors did not know what she had, and she needed to determine if she can receive the second dose. She also asked if we could notify her if a similar reaction is reported. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing low thyroid and mostly it&#39;s food allergies. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 125 ug, daily for low thyroid. The consumer stated, I took the vaccine on Monday (25Jan2021), three days ago and as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I came prepared because I do have some reactions sometimes. Mostly it&#39;s food allergies but I guess was being prepared, so I took Benadryl with me and I took it out of the packet. When probed for the treatment, consumer stated, &#34;I just took Benadryl as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I was prepared and I took my Benadryl with me and we stayed there I guess about 45 minutes until I felt better it would have been 12:15 and I was fine.&#34; The consumer stated, &#34;I have been trying for two days, that was in my arms hurting a little on an unspecified date in Jan2021 and then today (28Jan2021) around noon I was feeling a reaction again. I had the tightening in my neck and around my mouth area that&#39;s where I usually get the reactions from, but for two days I have been fine and I did not eat anything on an unspecified date in Jan2021 out of the way to give me a reaction to it. Now I took 2 Benadryl and it subsided but it&#39;s still tight around my neck and a little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness. What am I supposed to do? After I took this shot on Monday today is Thursday and I am having the same reactions that I had when I took (incomplete sentence) (pending clarification). The outcome of the events as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange was recovered on 25Jan2021, little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness and tightening in my neck and around my mouth area was not recovered and other events was unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Jan2021 (vaccination age 77 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

She &#34;cannot get more than 2-3 hours of sleep other than 1-2 exceptions&#34;.  Also, her &#34;BP wakes her from a dead sleep&#34;.  When she wakes up, she usually &#34;takes a rice [pad] and applies hot and cold to her neck, and she sometimes takes some Tylenol&#34;. &#34;Every time [she] wakes up, her BP [readings] are around 152/101 and 160/97. She has been in and out of the hospital for her high BP.  After the hospital, she called (Number) because her BP &#34;was off the chart&#34;. Her cardiologist ruled out heart issues. She did an &#34;echo, a stress test and EKG&#34;.  On 01Feb2021 she was admitted to hospital with 200/103 blood pressure. Ruled out cardiovascular &amp; placed on Amlodipine. Now 37 Days later with many visits to doctors, blood pressure remains high. Cardiologist ran stress test &amp; echo with no heart issues. Placed on many Blood Pressure Medications that also created side-affects (urination, flushing, dizziness, extreme headaches); Amlodipine 5 mg, Metoprolol 25 mg, Alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed, Propranol 20 mg. Today, picking up yet another (Hydralazine?) as last-ditch effort. BP daily spikes remain high (160/99 and 175/100). Racing Pulse &amp; BP wakes me out of a dead sleep within 1-2 hours. So weak &amp; constant neck pain that feels like someone is placing pressure around my neck. The blood pressure medication received are the following: Amlodipine from 1Feb2021 until 9Feb2021. She explained it work well to manage her BP but she &#34;could not urinate and had red flashes in [her] face&#34;; therefore, it was stopped by her cardiologist.

She woke up around 1:30am/2am&#34; her heartrate was at &#34;93&#34; and she put heat and cold on her neck to settle the pain. She specified the headache and pain were so bad it lasted for 1.5 hours, and her BP was 150/93 at 3 am .She added she had a &#34;red and flushed face&#34; and therefore took a &#34;Benadryl at 4am&#34;. She explained her BP was down to &#34;125/78&#34;, after taking the Benadryl, but got up to &#34;147/90&#34; at 7 am when she attempted to call Pfizer. She explained she has &#34;done [her] due diligence: she consulted HCP, did all the test, she attempted to go for walks and do activities she can tolerate, but her symptoms persist. She added she use to golf and cannot anymore. She explained her symptoms are persisting until this day and her body won&#39;t handle it further.

She struggled to raise her arms, reach her arms out, or grasp objects. She lacked energy, she would sleep for 10 hours every night, and she had difficulty concentrating and remembering what she was reading,

This time it quickly turned into tremendous pain; no energy; I slept most of the time; tired; chills; fever; headache; flu-like ache; muscle pain; queasiness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Feb2021 at 13:15 (at the age of 77-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient took the first dose of BNT162b2 (lot number E13246) on 27Jan2021 at right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included High blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol, all managed. The patient had also history of sciatica nerve pain in in early Jan2021, resolved with 5 days of meloxicam. Concomitant medication included atenolol, hydralazine, pravastatin and budesonide/formoterol fumarate (SYMBICORT). The patient reported that 2 hours after vaccination, at home, she felt tired, quickly turned to chills and fever. Body temperature was 99.9 F. She never run temps. This was followed by headache, flu-like ache, muscle pain, queasiness, and just terrible in general. She spoke with nurse who gave her shot to see if I should take any fever reducers. She said try to hold off, but if bad, take Tylenol or Ibuprofen. On 20Feb2021 sciatic nerve just blew up. She had an episode in early January, but Meloxicam worked in 5 days and she was fine. This time it quickly turned into tremendous pain-could not walk without help, trouble getting in or out of bed and to the bathroom. She was screaming out in pain. She started taking Tylenol and then Ibuprofen. Nothing helped. She had a few Meloxicam pills left and took one 22feb2021. Temps were rising daily (101.5) chilled, no energy. She slept most of the time straight chair. Sciatica was better, but not gone. Day 9, she walked outside, temp was normal. She was sent for flu &amp; Covid tests (nasal swab), both negative.  The outcome of events was recovering.    No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 77-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EN6201, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 (at the age of 77-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included DILTIAZEM. Patient stated I take Tiadylt and it is, I think maybe to dilate blood vessels and rest of the stuff is over the counter. The patient received the vaccine on 06Feb2021 and experienced some muscle soreness. Patient stated, I just wanted to report that I received a Pfizer Covid vaccine on February 6th and experienced some muscle soreness. But on the 12Feb2021, I started feeling like kind of small lumps in that muscle or little below and some redness and by Saturday, redness was about three and a half inches in length and two inches wide and lumps are still there, you could see the lumps. Also, I could feel that knot, it is probably like an inch and a half big knot. I am just thinking if it was reaction. It itched a lot but I didn&#39;t really have any pain or discomfort with it, it just was red and little warmer to touch. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of redness and vaccination site lump was reported as recovering, while the outcome of itching and muscle soreness was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                Had a stroke from blood clot; she lost weight; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (mother) that: A 77-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8272) via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021, as a single for COVID-19 immunization. Previously patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (covid-19 vaccine, Batch/Lot Number: not clear) via an unspecified route of administration on 10Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Reporter stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know so I just was try to find out or who I report or ask about. I convinced my mother to get her Covid vaccine, so she got her second shot on 31Mar we got it together. Yesterday (17May2021 ) my mom had a stroke from blood clot, and I was just asking myself if it could have had anything to do with from Pfizer shot as she never had any problem like that and now, she was in the hospital from the stroke, and I was just wondering if me talking her and getting her vaccine could possibly had to do with this. Reporter further stated, Absolutely, I have question as far as if that was the cause, was there any special treatment that she should be getting maybe I can at least inform the doctor about that anything. I am out of my mind right now because I felt that I talk to her getting the vaccine because I want to her to be safe, she was 77 yrs. old (Not clarified) she never had any medical problem I feel guilty. Height and weight: Reporter stated, She was approximately 5&#39;6. I don&#39;t know the weight as she lost weight, she was not obese or anything like that, but I honestly don&#39;t know her weight. The outcome for the events was unknown.

MRI normal. They talked about Gabapentin and said he did not believe it was that. Caller says she told him that she had gone back on it. She was getting more muscle control.

PRIVACY confirmed that all of the problems were from the second dose. Caller stated that her friend knew a scientist that said that if it was from vaccine, it would take at least 3 months to get normal. It is getting more normal, her eyes. She is driving. Once in awhile it gets a little blurry but mostly pretty clear. It is nothing like before. She could only read one line and texting she knew where it was. She mainly sat around with her eyes closed resting them. Her biggest fear was they would close and not open.

She had fungus from the pneumonia. It took 3 months to heal the fungus. Cancer was back up higher than the first time. When it was down low enough, she had the transplant. Caller stated that day or two after blood test for Myasthenia Gravis, she had difficulty swallowing. She looked at internet. She thinks it was just nerves and trying to keep her eyes open.

                                                she had 5 days of exhaustion where she felt like she couldn&#39;t get out of her chair; she was also very aware of her stomach; two twinges in her arm; she couldn&#39;t even stand clothes on her legs; skin on her left leg started to hurt so much that it reminded of her of having a neuralgia; She had stinging on the top and behind her knee and it traveled down towards her ankle and up towards her upper thigh/stinging in certain parts of her leg; skin on her left leg feels burning; left leg felt like it needed cold and not heat; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0178; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25May2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 77-year-old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation at Clinic. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure, high cholesterol and it runs in her family (She has tried all the different &#34;statin&#34; medications and she couldn&#39;t tolerate any of them. Her cardiologist told her there was an injection she could take for her cholesterol every two weeks and it was supposed to be like a &#34;liquid plumber&#34; for your veins. She is so sensitive to medications including all these &#34;statin&#34; medications, there is no way she can take the bi-weekly injection. It might have a much more profound negative affect on her. She was so leery of taking medications, even over the counter medications), gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 4 cardiac stent placements in 2015, blood pressure abnormal, allergies (unspecified), sinus are swollen, neuralgia, cataract surgery (a year and half ago), retina had swelled and sensitivity to heat. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRINE) chewable tablets at a dose of 81 mg daily for sinuses are swollen (her sinuses are not swollen at this time), loteprednol etabonate (LOTREL) for blood pressure abnormal. The Lotrel keeps her blood pressure around 120/70mmHg, famotidine (PEPCID) for gastrooesophageal reflux disease. The patient previously took tylenol and experienced allergy and giant hives. Aspirin give her hives but usually a hive here or there, not real big hives, ilevro for retina swelling and affected her skin on her face (She did have a problem while she was taking the steroid eye drops. They made her feel very unwell. She does not take Prednisone for the same reason. She had tried many different steroid eye drops and so many of them gave her a problem. She ended up taking Ilevro. She had no choice but to take it. The Ilevro affected the skin on her face. Her retinas had to stop swelling. Everything is fine now. She has no glaucoma or macular degeneration. This occurred a year and half ago when she had her cataract surgery). She had given the nurse who gave her the injection a list of all her allergies and sensitivities and the nurse reviewed the list and didn&#39;t see anything in the Covid 19 vaccine that would cause the caller harm based on her list of allergies and sensitivities. The caller took a deep breath and prayed while she received the Covid 19 vaccine. After the vaccine she waited at the facility and she was fine and then she left to go home. She ever had an adverse event with any other vaccines she reports she has not been vaccinated with anything since she was a child. She didn&#39;t even have the Polio vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the suspect vaccine. After getting the Covid 19 vaccine, on an unspecified date, the patient had 5 days of exhaustion where she felt like she couldn&#39;t get out of her chair and she was also very aware of her stomach. Her stomach wasn&#39;t upset but she was aware of it. That slowly passed and she started doing the things she needed to do. She needs to walk because of her heart stents. She had been fine after the Covid 19 vaccine until last night on 10Jun2021 at 21:30 the patient skin on her left leg started to hurt so much that it reminded of her of having a neuralgia. She provides an example of her sometimes feeling a draft and she can develop a neuralgia from the draft for a day or two. That&#39;s what her leg felt like initially. As the night wore on, around 22:00, she realized she couldn&#39;t even stand clothes on her legs. She wears nightgowns, not pajamas and she had to take her nightgown off her leg. The sensation in her leg started changing, she could feel that she not only had the skin hurting sensation but now she had stinging in certain parts of her leg. She had stinging on the top and behind her knee and it traveled down towards her ankle and up towards her upper thigh. It was bizarre. She thought about it this morning, 11Jun2021, what it felt like. She remembered way back, long ago, and she was not a sun person, but it felt like how a sunburn would feel. The skin on her left leg feels burning. She used Aspercreme on her leg thinking it will help with the pain. She wiped all the Aspercreme off her leg. She could not cover her left leg. Her left leg felt like it needed cold and not heat. She does have a history of sensitivity to heat. She runs her air conditioner, and she had a ceiling fan above her bed. She had her left leg exposed and out of her bed covers to try and get the cold air on her hot leg. Finally, around 23:30, her leg still bothered her, but she was able to go to sleep. She twisted and turned at night but was finally able to put her bed cover back on her leg but lightly. The sensation was still there in her leg. She was so sensitive. On an unspecified date, the patient had two twinges in her arm and then her arm never hurt again. The events did not result in emergency room or Physician Office. She is due for her second Covid 19 vaccine on 15Jun2021. The outcome of the events she had 5 days of exhaustion where she felt like she couldn&#39;t get out of her chair, she was also very aware of her stomach, two twinges in her arm was unknown and the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on lot/batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Flare of her RA/ rheumatoid arthritis really got bad and painful in joints; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- EM9809) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Feb2021 at 12:30 as dose 1 single (at the age of 77-year-old) and also received second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Feb2021 at 14:00 as dose 2 single (at the age of 77-year-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included illness at time of vaccination, rheumatoid arthritis, blood pressure, cholesterol, occasional spastic bowel, blood type: Rh-Negative. No investigation assessment was reported. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks), adverse events following prior vaccinations, family medical history relevant to adverse event were reported as none. Concomitant medications included methotrexate 2.5 mg, weekly (2.5 mg tablets orally. Takes 9 tablets by mouth once a week) for Rheumatoid arthritis from 23 years, atorvastatin 40 mg, daily for Cholesterol (had been taking 10-15 years), atenolol 25 mg, daily for Blood pressure (Had been taking 10-15 years), hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene (TRIAMTERENE &amp; HCTZ) daily (37.5/25 mg) for fluid retention and blood pressure (Had been taking 10-15 years). The patient experienced flare of rheumatoid arthritis, it really got bad and pain in joints lasted about 5 weeks before she contacted the rheumatologist, started around 17Feb2021 or 18Feb2021 and had subsided. She had flares on occasions and when agent asked her about documenting the experience, she added that there was no way to be proven whether it was due to the shot or that she came off her medication. Patient stated it subsided within a couple days of going on the prednisone, some time in Apr2021. Patient stated it took about six weeks to get back.  Patient stated she had both vaccine shots from Pfizer back in Feb2021 and a couple weeks ago, she heard on the news, and some friends have told her about it since, and she did check it out online, that a study was done at the same time, on the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine on patients who had been on methotrexate. Patient stated the findings were that those patients, in four control groups, were 62% covered on the vaccine versus the 95%. Patient added that means some were above 62%, and some were below. Patient stated she was curious because she&#39;s been on methotrexate for 23 years, she did stop it the week before and after each shot. Patient asked was there any way of finding out her own personal protection. Patient stated she did call her doctor about antibody testing, and the doctor told her she was not sure what it would show her, since she&#39;s not under a controlled situation, with exact dates that she stopped taking and retook it, also she had a flare at that time, about two weeks after the shot, where her rheumatoid arthritis really got bad and painful in joints. Patient stated it took about six weeks to get back. Patient stated she would have the flares on occasions anyway. Patient clarified this was not why she called and adds that when she mentioned it to her rheumatologist, she was told insurance would not cover it because she was not classified under any research program. Patient stated she did not go to the doctor, she suffered with it until her primary said call your doctor, call you rheumatologist for the pain. Did not go to the doctor, only called because it was covid time and everything was either via phone or video. Stated her rheumatologist has known her long enough to feel safe diagnosing. Not required to visit Emergency Room and Physician Office. Patient again stated she was not sure the event reported was from the vaccine. Patient reported an AE/PC for Methotrexate reports she&#39;s been on methotrexate for 23 years, she did stop it the week before and after each shot. Patient stated she would have the flares on occasions anyway. Relevant tests were reported as none. Product strength and count size dispensed: 2.5 mg tablets. Treatment medication included Prednisone: 5 mg tablets, started with four tablets once a day for two days, then three tablets for two days, then two tablets once a day for two days, then one tablet once a day for two days. Took a total of eight days. The outcome of the event was recovered in Apr2021.   Information on the lot/batch was available, Additional information has been requested.

                                                I first lost my nail. It was unusual because there was no trauma to the nail. I was reaching for something across my bed, and I started experiencing radiating pain across my chest as well as pressure. I stayed very still and then it spread through my left arm and up into my shoulder, neck ear and jaw. I remained still and tried breathing the best I could. This lasted a minute or two and then it released and was over. About a month later, I was diagnosed with RSV which ran down into my lungs and soon my blood pressure was going up because my heart was working so hard to breathe. It was over 200/175 which is abnormal for me. I had to end up calling an ambulance because I was having trouble breathing. I was prescribed blood pressure medication, steroids, antibiotics, prednisone and oxygen. I was not allowed to get out of bed, I couldn&#39;t walk. They told me it would take baby steps.

A 78-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization, ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at an unknown dose and frequency for an unspecified indication and pirfenidone (ESBRIET), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at an unknown dose and frequency for an unspecified indication. Medical history included pulmonary fibrosis (diagnosed between 2007-2010), Lymphoma type B, blood pressure (abnormal), cholesterol (abnormal), vertigo, biopsy, tightening of legs and feet, drip (nasal) and pain. Concomitant medication included gabapentin for tightening of her legs and feet, diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) for drip (nasal) and meloxicam for pain. It was reported that the patient took the vaccine and had two sleepless nights on 05Jan2021, her body turned very hot but she have some conditions. Sleepless nights: they have been really rough nights. Scary. Coughing and choking. She thinks the vaccine kicked in and started beating the hell out of it. The patient clarified that she is having sleepless nights because of the coughing, choking, and burning and she feels that it is related to the vaccine kicking in. She slept last night, 14Jan2021. The cough is starting again today (as reported). She hopes it calms down. When she said her body was hot, like burning she was describing her sleepless nights. She is afraid. She is keeping in contact with her doctor. She figured she better call because more people are on this medication. The patient also experienced congestion on 06Jan2021. It was reported that the patient has shrunk and weighed less. Maybe 154 pounds. She was 170. The action taken for ciprofloxacin and pirfenidone was unknown. The outcome of the event congestion was not recovered, while unknown for the rest of the events.

I literally slept all of the next day only getting up occasionally and most of the day after that.  I started to become more normal feeling the late afternoon of 1/28/21. I also felt very stiff and uncomfortable.  Sore neck and joint pain and a slight headache.  I had a sore area across my arm (felt like a bruise although there was no discoloration) about 1 inch inch below the injection sight which was on my upper left arm.  That persisted for several days. I slept and took 1 800 mg Ibuprofen (on   1/27/2021). Am feeling better but still not feeling 100 %.  That may be due to increased allergies due to time of year of etc a

A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) second dose, lot number: EL9262, via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at a single dose in the upper part of left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EJ1686, expiry Mar2021, on 07Jan2021, she had no reaction or anything. The patient had no medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was calling about the second shot, Pfizer asked if there were side effects on the second one, and there were, she can&#39;t say what went on yesterday, it was that bad. She was a volunteer at the hospital. She lost 3 pounds in the last few days from this. She was in no condition to talk to anyone yesterday, and in fact, she was getting hot now. Yesterday (26Jan2021) was the worst, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe, but her sheets were soaking wet, she kept having to urinate, and she&#39;s ashamed, she almost couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom, her aide said to not be ashamed, and she had a lot of diarrhea. It was around 2am she noted her sheets were soaking wet, and it started going away at 5AM. She was still having effects from the shot: she was still getting very hot and cold. Getting very hot and cold started 12:00PM Monday (25Jan2021) night. Getting hot and cold was like the chills. She has 27 chronic illnesses but doesn&#39;t think they have anything to do with the shot. She was grateful she got the shot and hopes everyone at Pfizer was able to get the shot. The outcome of the event &#39;sheets were soaking wet, she kept having to urinate&#39; was recovered on 27Jan2021, diarrhea and getting very hot and cold was recovering, lost 3 pounds and chills was unknown.

                                                Neurology consult 2/13/21:  This is a 78-year-old female we were consulted by Dr. for possible guillian barre s/p COVID vaccine.  The patient tells me that she was in her normal state of health, and she received her 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccineseen 7 days ago.  Subsequent to that, the next day she developed chills, fatigue that continued for approximately 2 days.  She states that 3 days ago, she woke up and was unable to lift her legs or get herself out of bed on her own.  She felt weak in her proximal lower extremities and her trunk.  She denied any bandlike sensations or paresthesias.  She cannot tell me that she developed any distal lower extremity weakness initially but felt that it was the acute onset.  She needed some help her out of bed when she was upright, she was able to use her walker to slowly get to the factor.  She may have had some urinary incontinence, she does complain of diarrhea now.   Denies any tingling sensation, no bulbar symptoms.  This is a 78-year-old female who we were asked to evaluate for possible Guillain-Barre syndrome.  She had acute onset of lower much greater than upper extremity weakness without any definite ascending features, of relevance, is that she received the COVID-19 vaccine 3 days prior to the onset of her symptoms.  She did exhibit flu-like symptoms prior to this.  Given that she does not have any specific area of intrathecal enhancement to suggest Guillain-Barre or other areas of radiculitis, I think it is reasonable to proceed with lumbar puncture to look for any other source.   --Given the findings on the MRI cervical and lumbar spine including enhancement of the bilateral sacral S1 region, I would like Neurosurgery to further evaluate. -- would likely benefit from CT chest abdomen pelvis to rule out any underlying occult malignancy particularly if workup remains unremarkable. -- continue supportive care, monitor for shortness of breath, new vital capacities  Patient remains admitted to the hospital with continued weakness at the time of this report

The patient had no family medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had her first dose yesterday (31Jan2021), and she had some reactions to it last night 31Jan2021, had fever, headache and pains in knee and muscle above knee. She knows some of the side effect was normal. She was wondering more so, when is it ok to take a pain reliever for it, like aspirin or Ibuprofen. She went online and it said not to take anything, so she did not. She imagined her fever went away sometime during the night, she took it (unspecified) twice last night. This morning when she woke up, she had the headache, and it&#39;s gone now. Her pain in the knee started 4 hours after the injection, it was still sore but much better. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The outcome of the event fever was recovered on 31Jan2021, headache recovered on 01Feb2021 and for events pains in knee and muscle above knee was recovering.

Also beginning Friday, March  5th woke up with right arm swollen just below the elbow.  Not sure if any of this is related to the Covid shot or having other problems. Just noticed that my vaccine card shows Lot #EN6202 but the letter sent says Lot #EL9263, for the 2nd dose.

                                                I was vaccinated with Pfizer for the first time 11 days ago. Within a few minutes of being vaccinated, I felt nauseated but I did NOT throw up. I have been sick ever since with one thing and another. For the first several days after being vaccinated, I had a sore arm, which I expected. I have also experienced extreme fatigue, chills, nausea, muscle and joint aches, a sore throat (briefly), an occasional headache, tenderness in my left armpit and along the left side of my rib cage, stomach pain and diarrhea and at times, a low-grade fever and sweating. My memory and ability to focus on my work have been affected. Yesterday (March 13), I felt OK all day and thought I was better at last, but after I ate dinner, I vomited and had diarrhea. I told my primary care physician about all of this in an email and she replied that my symptoms were &#34;normal.&#34; I&#39;m not so sure. I haven&#39;t read of anyone else feeling so sick for so long after the first dose of Pfizer.

                                                The injection was given high up on my arm and was very painful.  About an hour after receiving the shot my arm felt weak and my hand and fingers felt numb.  I could not raise my arm.  This lasted into the next day, when my shoulder began to hurt. The feeling returned to my hand but I started getting drawing pains in my arm, and increasing pain in my arm when raising it.

The patient experienced moderate to severe bilateral wrist pain on 21Feb2021 15:00 and, moderate to severe bilateral hand pain on 21Feb2021 15:00 and Day 5 of Moderate to severe bilateral hand and wrist pain following Pfizer 1st COVID-19 injection 0n 21Feb2021. Unable to prepare meals, wash dishes, do laundry or other daily chores. My son is typing this message for me. At this time I do not plan to get the second injection.

This nurse (patient) reported that a 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6204) at the age of 78-years, via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 at single dose; first single dose of BNT162B2 (lot: EM9810) on 11Feb2021; both for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoarthritis (having aches and pains) had for 20 years; large sliding hiatal hernia was diagnosed from an EGD six months before, didn&#39;t want surgery to fix it; heartburn (last five years); fatty liver, was not from drinking alcohol; generalized anxiety; was tuberculosis positive only because she was exposed years ago. Concomitant medications included pantoprazole started four to five years before at 40 mg twice a day for heartburn; escitalopram (tablet) been on for 15 years or longer at 10 mg 1 DF every day for generalized anxiety; clonazepam 0.5 mg nightly at bedtime for anxiety (been taking for last ten years or more, stops her from worrying about her kids and stuff like that). The patient experienced on 07Mar2021, low grade fever, weakness, chronically dehydrated and cough; on 15Mar2021, rash, acute pain and with deep breaths; on an unspecified date, no desire to eat or drink. Seriousness criteria of these events were reported as disabling. Patient reported that was having major problems, a delayed immune response. Told everybody if this keeps up she was not going to make it. It was wearing her down and she was not going to survive. Occurred after second COVID vaccine. She is active, goes to pool, and does different things. Had vaccine on Thursday and was ok until Sunday. Started Sunday with low grade fever. Kept being low grade and never got to 101, 102, or 103. She didn&#39;t take ibuprofen. Usually takes ibuprofen once a day for routine aches and pains. Having weakness. Had no desire to eat or drink. She waited a couple days, but then called her doctor. Doctor&#39;s office wouldn&#39;t give her an appointment. Stated this wasn&#39;t the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller&#39;s daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn&#39;t feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn&#39;t her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn&#39;t order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn&#39;t itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn&#39;t take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn&#39;t want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn&#39;t right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn&#39;t nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn&#39;t help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn&#39;t make her sick, just didn&#39;t want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren&#39;t really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn&#39;t feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn&#39;t itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn&#39;t think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn&#39;t working and her body couldn&#39;t get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn&#39;t think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like &#34;oh that second shot.&#34; If she didn&#39;t get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn&#39;t know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn&#39;t take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn&#39;t want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn&#39;t think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn&#39;t know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn&#39;t say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn&#39;t feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

A 78-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE)), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 17Mar2021 12:10 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 31May2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID19 vaccine on 23Feb2021 (lot number: EN6198 with expiry date 31May2021) for Covid-19 immunization.

It was further reported that the patient got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine that day on 17Mar2021 and about 12:45am or 1:30am the next morning she was awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking; the shaking has resolved completely but she is not sure when it resolved but she was shaking for a good while because she can remember being so uncomfortable with her body moving so much which went on for maybe 20 minutes or so when her husband woke up.Patient&#39;s husband then woke up and got Ibuprofen and gave it to her and that stopped the shaking which surprised her and she did not know the Ibuprofen would work to stop the shaking that well and the Ibuprofen did work in stopping the shaking. The Ibuprofen stopped the shaking and she can remember to touch her body felt warm but then she was freezing and she does not know what this means but this was not ongoing and resolved when her husband gave her the ibuprofen and she stopped shaking right away which always amazed her that the Ibuprofen worked. She stated fortunately the Ibuprofen stopped her from shaking and she was able to sleep until early morning when she woke up and knew she was sick and was different and very weak; states the weakness was not ongoing and the approximate time the weakness resolved was unknown but she was down the rest of the day and after that she passed out for a very short period of  time and held her head up and stood up and thought wow something was going on and asked where was this coming from and it was not nausea but she was just weak. She has not passed out for a huge amount of time but fortunately she had some towels laying close by and was able to use a towel; states after that she stopped for the rest of the day and only got up to go to the potty and was just so weak and heard that from many people that they just slept afterwards.Caller states her muscles were sore and she realized that was just normal and after the 2nd dose of the vaccine she knew her muscles would probably be sore and this was resolved. She came downstairs and was sitting on a chair and then stood and no longer sat in the chair and her husband knew things were not right with her and her eyes looked funny and she passed out and that never happened to her before and she was passed out for a few moments. Other than the Ibuprofen she did not have treatment and did not go to the emergency room or the HCP office. Patient only took one Ibuprofen and she has a very small body and her husband sometimes takes 2-3 Ibuprofen and she thinks wow that is so many but she herself does not have any medication and she just took one Ibuprofen and it worked; She took the Ibuprofen on 18Mar2021 in the early morning. Fortunately she was in good health. Outcome of the event passed out for a very short period of  time, was awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking and muscles were sore was recovered in Mar2021, and unknown outcome for the remaining events.

The patient reported side effects from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Her arm was still bothering her. There was a lump down from where the injection site was and that she kept rubbing it but it won&#39;t go away and that she still had pain.

The patient stated the lump felt like it was the size of a nickel, she was pushing to try to feel it and that maybe the lump was a little larger than a nickel. Her shoulder aches and the feeling went into the arm and it started the same week she had the shot but that she didn&#39;t pay any attention so is not sure exactly when it started. It was best to check it out with her doctor. The outcome for event pain and vaccination site lump was not recovered, while for remains event was unknown.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID- 19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 78-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL1283) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypo thyroiditis (does not have it anymore, it was 30 years ago when she was a teacher), knee that was broken twice and allergic to antibiotics from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down/something clicks in body, heart beats really fast, really bad pain in her right knee, muscles really tight, didn&#39;t feel so good, she was scared to death, her nerves, anxiety and very frightened. The reporter stated that feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down, was happened after she got her first covid shot. The patient asked to know if it was safe for her to get the second dose of the vaccine. The patient wondered if anyone else, she had the first Pfizer vaccine, later clarified as the COVID vaccine, a week ago last day before the time of this report, and she used to have a really fast heartbeat, but it slowed down, and once in a while, it was fast and stuff, now she had this happened twice, where she felt something click in her body, her heart beats really fast, and she drank water immediately, it slows down, has anyone said this after getting the vaccine. She has been on the phone for two hours. She never had a little click, she had thyroid hypo thyroiditis and every evening she would have a fast heartbeat, her blood pressure would go, but she never had when she would feel this little click, like a little, and her heart was really fast in morning of the report, it was really fast, and the minute she drinks water, it slows it down, it does not make sense. Also, her muscles are really tight, she was 78 and having a hard time with this pandemic, her nerves not good, she was nervous about the vaccine. She stated she was a teacher, and her weight was 106-107 pounds. About the event feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down/something clicks in body, heart beats really fast, the patient stated, unknown when this started, exact date unknown, this has happened twice, this morning was the second one, and the minute she drank water, it slows it down, but it was very very fast, and she did not feel so good after, she was scared to death, her nerves are shot, she has trouble with anxiety, she was feeling ok now. She was nervous about what was going on and would feel better if someone else said they experienced the same. About the event muscles being really tight, the patient stated she has knots, her muscles are tight in her shoulders and neck lots, last night she was writing recipes, she does recipes boxes for her grandkids, and she was using her right arm a lot, she does not get to go to spa since the pandemic, she has not gotten to go to her for over a year. Her husband rubbed it out, and she did heat. Her muscles were tight right after she did it, so it could be something, it said if you think you had a symptom and also the second night after, she had a really bad pain in her right knee, it lasted one night, it was a knee that was broken twice, which may be why it was that leg. She was very very frightened to take it, she reacts to things strangely, when she has any procedure, they always say they never had that happen to anyone, she was allergic to antibiotics, different things happen when she takes different things, she was nervous about the whole thing, which may have to do with it. The second dose is on 12Feb2021. The outcome of the event muscles really tight was recovering and unknown for other events.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 11Jan2021 10:50 (Batch/Lot Number: EJ1686; Expiration Date: 20Mar2021) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE, vaccinated at the age of 78 years old for covid-19 immunisation. Patient received the first dose on 21Dec2020. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism Diagnosed 20 years ago, ongoing colitis, ongoing proctitis, ongoing diverticulum, ongoing gastrointestinal pain, and breast cancer. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism, start and stop date were not reported. Caller states she was told by a couple of doctors that she needed to report this. Caller states her first vaccine was 21Dec2021 and then her second dose was on 11Jan2021. Caller states four days after the second dose, she wound up in the ER with severe headache, abdominal pain, dry heaves and she had a morbid feeling. Caller states after that, she saw her doctor and for two months she had problems with nausea, severe nausea, where she couldn&#39;t eat, lost 13 pounds, hypothyroid went to hyperthyroid, very serious extreme anxiety, which she is still battling. Caller states the Endocrinologist felt it could&#39;ve been associated with the vaccine. Caller states the ER ran tests and abdominal scans and all they showed were the usual things she knew she had, nothing new. Caller states she asked the ER doctors, and they said they didn&#39;t know if it was related and when she asked Endocrinology, they said they don&#39;t know for sure. Caller states her Primary doctor said it could be related, anytime a person has a vaccination, if they are immunocompromised or have inflammation, it can possibly trigger this and events occur. Caller states she had dry heaves, an aversion to food, lost weight, and had terrible anxiety, all four days after vaccine. Caller states after the first vaccine, she was fine. Caller states after the second vaccine, she woke up that morning four days after, it was acute, this had never happened before and she had a feeling of doom and dry heaving. Caller states it took her two months, before she started to eat and put the weight back on. Caller states the nausea is gone and she is able to eat and put weight back on. Caller states she still has extreme anxiety and she is seeing a doctor for that and is being medicated so it is persisting by improved with medicaiton. Caller repeats, this all happened four days after her second injection. Caller states no one knows that much about the vaccine but they said something that this reaction should be reported. Caller states the nausea and other GI issues lasted for about two months, but she can&#39;t give actual dates of when it recovered. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know dates of when the other side effects recovered, but they only thing she still has is the anxiety. Seriousness: Caller states the Nausea was disabling, she couldn&#39;t eat at all, she had to drink ensure and boost. Caller states the rest were medically significant. She was worked on by her PCP and Endocrinologist, and they adjusted her thyroid medication to bring back down her levels, and she is sure that is part of the reason for her anxiety and anorexia. Caller states before she had hypothyroid. Treatment: Suppositories, Zofran, Reglan, Anxiety Medication, Adjustment of the thyroid medication Synthroid. States when she lost an extreme amount of weight, her thyroxin increased, so they dropped her dose to the normal range. Causality: Caller states she feels it is related because it was an acute onset and rare for her, even though she is older, she is healthy. Caller states she has had breast cancer but nothing that stopped her from working. Caller states it is hard to know, but she thinks it is related. Caller states her one son was home and called and said mom looks like she is going to pass out and she is not an alarmist and usually would say no, but she said yes, he better make sure that she gets to the ER, she felt impending doom, with abrupt onset. Tests: Caller states they did an Endoscopy and Colonoscopy because of her abdominal pain and they found colitis and proctitis and every, itis, a person can think of along with diverticulosis and inflamed gut, but she already had those, they were not caused by the vaccine, she had them in the past. Outcome of anxiety was recovering, of others was recovered in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship between events anxiety, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, retching, malaise, weight decreased, hyperthyroidism, decreased appetite, eating disorder and company suspect BNT162B2, the causal relationship cannot be denied.

Very weak, my legs felt as though they couldn&#39;t hold me up.  I was so exhausted.  I am still having issues.  I thought I was feeling better, I thought, but I am still experiencing  the issue with the weak legs, being so tired. I also feel light headed lately.  I did see my family doctor 2x and spoke with him on the phone a couple times.  He did blood work, all came back good.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID- 19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 26Jan2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, Single Dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Von willebrand&#39;s disease Von Willebrand syndrome and Glanzmann&#39;s disease and allergies. Family history included bleeding disorder. She was poisoned by pesticides and formaldehyde years ago and they burned her entire respiratory system. There were no concomitant medications. The patient never had a reaction to a vaccine. No vaccines administered on same Date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations were given within 4 weeks and no adverse events following prior vaccinations. On an unspecified date of Feb2021, the patient experienced lips tingling, face red which felt like swollen, tongue started to tingle, her face felt tight. The events lasted about 1- 2 hours. Patient wanted to know; can she take a Benadryl before the vaccine. The second dose is due on 16Feb2021 so the first dose was 3 weeks before that one was due. After getting the shot, her lips started to tingle, tongue started to tingle, and her face felt real tight. When the nurse came out to check on her, she was told by the nurse her face was really red. The nurse was going to get an EpiPen and wanted to call EMS. The reporter states she told her to just give her a Benadryl, she normally has them in her car but had run out. Patient stated she was allergic to everything. Anything coming in contact with her respiratory system such as hair spray, scents, any chemical causes her problems. The patient explained that she was re-reading the information about telling the vaccination provider about medication conditions including allergies and bleeding disorder, both of which she has. She was concerned about getting the second dose. She wants to know if the first dose will offer any protection. She had the first dose of the covid shot on 26Jan2021. She started feeling funny. The patient called the nurse and reports her lips were tingling and her tongue was starting to tingle. Her face was really red. Her face felt like it had pressure like it was blowing up but it did not feel swollen, it was tomato red. The patient queried if she does not get the second dose what will that do. She knows there needs to be given a certain amount of time between the doses. She heard on the tv that it can be given up to 45 days and still be effective. She heard all kinds of information, she heard that someone should get the second dose within 28 days and the paperwork states something different. Asked if her reaction will be worse with second shot. She was supposed to go back on 16Feb2021 for the second dose. Patient stated she took Benadryl after her reaction from the vaccine. She wanted to know if this affects the vaccine. Patient mentioned the fact sheet states that patients should tell the vaccination provider if they have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner. She states she has a bleeding disorder. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. She took a Benadryl for treatment. The outcome of the event was resolved on an unspecified date of Feb2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up attempts completed. No further information expected.

The outcome of events flare, cataracts, nausea, flu like symptoms, was recovered; everything started hurting, back pain, swelling of fingers was not recovered; other events was unknown. The report was considered involved or prolonged inpatient hospitalization and other medically important condition.  Causality for humira (adalimumab): the reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of flare, body aches, nausea, flu like symptoms, depression, vomiting, lack of effect and urinary tract infection with humira(adalimumab) was a reasonable possibility. the reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of cataracts on both eyes, heart condition, fatigue, osteoarthritis affected knees and hands, two fingers on left hand and thumb would not bend was straight as a board, lump on left knee, one finger was bruised looking/burning and swollen finger on left hand after covid vaccine/hand swelling onset 02Mar2021, diabetes, another urinary tract infection, after taking covid vaccines and developed body aches and a flare with hands and achiness/sitting for long times everything started hurting, back pain, foot pain, shoulder pain, one finger was bruised looking/burning and swollen finger on left hand after covid vaccine/hand swelling onset 02Mar2021, redness in the hand and swelling in hand was not provided.

Abbvie&#39;s opinion is that there is a reasonable possibility that the events of body aches, nausea, flu like symptoms, urinary tract infection and another urinary tract infection are related to humira(adalimumab). Abbvie&#39;s opinion is that the event of heart condition is not assessable.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Reported events nausea, flu like symptoms, and vomiting are assessed as related to the suspect drug based on drug safety profile and temporal association. Other events are probably associated to patients underlying condition and are not related to BNT162B2. Case to be re-assessed upon receipt of new information.

Pt has had a cough as well. Pt has had a previous colonoscopy, but was told by GI that it was &#34;too soon to have another.&#34; Pt denies any recent antibiotics, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Pt states she is diabetic and her sugars have been 112 in the morning and 150 in the evening. Pt denies any abdominal surgery.

Pt denies a bowel movement today. Pt admits to both Covid-19 vaccine doses in March. Pt received the Pfizer vaccine.. The onset was chronic.  The course/duration of symptoms is worsening.  The character is not bloody.  Risk factors consist of not recent antibiotic use, not infectious exposure and no recent travel.  Associated symptoms: abdominal pain, nausea, cough, denies vomiting, denies fever, denies chest pain and denies shortness of breath. Patient seen examined emergency department for chief complaint of diarrhea that has been present for several weeks.  Patient has seen her GI doctor.  She states that stool cultures were obtained.  Stool cultures reviewed, which demonstrated all negative stool cultures.  Due to patient&#39;s persistent diarrhea, workup was obtained to rule out acute dehydration verses AKI verses electrolyte abnormality.  Workup obtained demonstrates no acute findings.  Patient was updated results.  On reexamination, patient states he has had no episodes of diarrhea in the ED.  This juncture, I believe patient is stable for discharge home with close follow-up with GI.  Patient is agreeable.  Return precautions are discussed, including change in mental status, decreased urinary output, or any other concerns..

She exercises regularly and has become so weak that she cannot climb stairs.  Neurological exam revealed hyperreflexia, subtle proximal muscle weakness, the presence of a startle reflex and rooting reflex, clonus, and a positive Babinski.  Infectious work up has been negative, autoimmune evaluation is underway.  Inpatient neurology consultation has been obtained, she was given a trial of diazepam for stiff person syndrome and started on daily IVIG on 2/3/2021 for a 5 day course. She continues to have an elevated CRP, a mild transaminitis, and mild thrombocytopenia.  The ESR dropped from 44 to 20 with hydration.  She has had no cognitive changes. No headache, visual changes, jaw pain. We are unable to obtain MRI given the presence of these coils which are not MRI compatible.  Encephalitis immune antibodies are pending, myositis panel, MOG antibodies ADEM are pending, GAD65 antibody pending.

                                                I received my vaccine on Sunday, work up Monday with sore arm which I expected. Monday night around 9pm I had a fever 101.3, my normal pain lever increased bad, and my balance of worse than normal, to walk 20 yards I had to stop at least 5 times because my back was hurting so bad. The next day, I woke up with normal fever but there was redness on the injection site a little larger than a silver dollar, around 8 my fever went up to 100. The next night, Wednesday night my fever was at 99.6, the next day my temp was normal and continued to be the rest of the time. The redness on my arm started fading and has continued to fade but I can still see where it is.

This morning the ache was still a little achy and tired, but that had cleared up by noon.

A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number A3249 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 21Jan2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included other medications. The patient had the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 21Jan2021 and the following day (22Jan2021), she experienced pain in the injection site and arm. The patient informed that it felt like someone stuck a knife in her muscle. The patient informed that the pain was improving and not sure if she wanted to get the second dose. The patient informed that she had a dental procedure done and was taking pain medication to help with that but it didn&#39;t help with her pain in her arm from the shot. The patient has been having pain at injection site all the way to her elbow. The patient informed that the first day they it was like she had a shot. The patient informed that it felt like a knife was being stuck in her muscle the second day (22Jan2021). The patient informed that today it felt like pressure.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection lot number: EN6201), intramuscular at upper left arm on 17Feb2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis in right shoulder and arm gets inflamed and sore; rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm. It sometimes flares up and gets sore) diagnosed in late 2019, ongoing Autoimmune deficiency disease diagnosed in late 2019 and lower left eyelid which was inverted. There were no concomitant medications. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient previously took Shingrix vaccine (Shingles vaccine) at left arm last year-2020 and she felt soreness and achiness in right shoulder and arm. The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine yesterday on 17Feb2021 at her left arm. A few hours later her right shoulder and right arm felt sore and achy. On 18Feb2021, the patient&#39;s right arm and shoulder were aching. The patient mentioned that this has also happened last year when she had a Shingrix vaccine. She was also injected in her left arm but her right arm got sore and achy. She felt soreness and achiness in right shoulder and arm. She wanted to know if this is a normal reaction from the vaccine. The patient stated that it was weird. On unspecified date, when she lifts her arm up high it hurts, she stated that she does have an inflamed shoulder. She did have an inflamed shoulder prior, it has been pretty good lately but flared up after the vaccine. During the night it was very bad. She does have rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm. It sometimes flares up and gets sore. She was wondering if there is a relationship with the COVID 19 vaccine because she felt like she got the COVID 19 vaccine in the right arm, she asked if she&#39;s reacting to the medication. No treatment was administered for right shoulder. Routine lab work done on 02Feb2021 but it has nothing to do with this. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The patient is also scheduled to have Botox in her lower eyelid for her left eye to release the nerve muscle. She asked if it is ok since she just had the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She is scheduled to get botox injection next week for lower left eyelid which is inverted, it was bothering her. They have to release the muscle by getting an injection of botox. She was receiving conflicting information from her PCP, who says wait a month and her ophthalmologist who says its ok to get the COVID 19 vaccine. She thought she heard something about not mixing botox with the vaccine. The outcome of the event &#34;She did have an inflamed shoulder prior, it has been pretty good lately but flared up after the vaccine/She does have rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm&#34; was unknown; and other events was recovering.

                                                Three days after second vaccine, I started to get sore in left shoulder, two hours later the pain had moved up my neck. By nighttime I could barely move my head to the left and pain was severe.  i was very chilled and could hardly stop shivering until I took a heating pad and dressed warmly and went to bed.  Sunday, still have a lot of pain and taking aspirin for the pain.  Also will use SalonPas for the painful areas to see if that helps.  Still cannot move my head to the left without pain.

A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 18Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included family history of glaucoma from 2019 (Her mother has Glaucoma); memory ain&#39;t that good (she puts everything on her calendar because her memory ain&#39;t that good); ongoing irregular heart beat since 2006 (periodically when she goes to the doctor they have her walk the treadmill and stuff like that); ongoing diabetes since 2011; and was allergic to Penicillin (as a kid she was bitten by a dog, she must have been about 12 years old, went to hospital they gave her a shot of penicillin, her head blew up, she looked like a monster, she went back they gave her Streptomycin). Concomitant medication(s) included brimonidine taken for glaucoma from 21Feb2021 to 01Mar2021; latanoprost taken for glaucoma; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for arrhythmia, and dyspnoea from 2019 and ongoing; and metoprolol taken for arrhythmia. The patient was administered with her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021. It went beautiful, she did not have any aftereffects or anything initially. On 01Mar2021, while in her own apartment she stood up to go to the bathroom and could not put her right leg down; she thought she was having a heart attack or a stroke or something and she fell on her right side. She went to the hospital where she was hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. MRI performed during that hospitalization had result of Cerebrovascular Accident-CVA. She also reported onset of diarrhea and nose running around 01Mar2021. When she went to the hospital on 01Mar2021 she was laying down, and when the doctor moved the blanket to test her legs her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt. The events were reported to have required a visit to the emergency room. They did not find anything else during hospitalization with testing. The only thing she can think of related to these events was the COVID-19 vaccine. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled for 11Mar2021 relative to these events. She was scheduled for second dose on 11Mar2021, but she is scared because of events that occurred 01Mar2021. The outcome of the events diarrhea, &#34;Nose running&#34;, &#34;Her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34;, &#34;her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder on 11Feb2021 at age of 79-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization; methylprednisolone (MEDROL, Tablet), orally from 20Feb2021  to 26Feb2021, at 4 mg, by mouth, frequency was different based on the day, from 27Feb2021  to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose for swelling, the back. Medical history included thyroid and pericarditis fluid. Family history included brother had heart disease. There was no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) ongoing for thyroid for 20 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 in left shoulder on 21Jan2021 (Batch/lot number: EN6201) for COVID-19 immunization with no side effects.  The patient had her 2nd Pfizer vaccine dose on 11Feb2021 and received a &#34;medrol pack&#34; on 20Feb2021 for &#34;shoulder, back and neck pain. She have felt lousy for 4 weeks. She went to the hospital with palpitations and it probably was from the 2nd pack of methylprednisolone, she was prescribed after the 1st pack did not really help her pain. She haven&#39;t been sick or had a cold for 25 years and the 2nd dose through her for a loop. She stated her daughter called her and she said that her doctor told her that her vaccine may not be effective and she may not be protected because she took methylprednisolone. The patient received the second vaccine on 11Feb2021 and she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling. The patient mentioned she went to her doctor because after calling the COVID hotline they said they had cases where some of the vaccine had seeped into the lymph nodes. She was told to have her lymph nodes. No patient demographic details provided regarding those other patients who had the vaccine seep into lymph nodes. She went on to explain she went to the doctor, but the doctor said there were no problems with the lymph nodes. On 13Feb2021, she felt achy and fatigued, back discomfort. The lightheadedness occurred on 18Feb2021. The doctor gave her a high dose of the methylprednisolone 4mg pack for a week. 16 days later on 27Feb2021 it had not touched the discomfort in back, fatigue and lightheadedness and gave her another pack of methylprednisolone.  She also had heart palpitation, was sweaty and went to the Emergency Room. The patient mentioned she took a low dose of levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). She asked the doctor about the methylprednisolone being taken after the shot. The patient heard it diminished the effect of the shot, that she may not have as much protection. She had called the COVID hotline to address this issue and they said people who were on chronic steroid therapy had no problem as far as they know. The patient asked if she was protected because she had the methylprednisolone pack the first one within 9 days after shot and a second pack 16 days later. She took a low dose of generic levothyroxine sodium every day. She commented she was concerned with the drug interaction and wanted to make sure still protected. She was informed by individual who answered COVID hotline she felt like she was still protected because others have been on chronic steroid therapy. Shoulder swelling started a couple day after the second shot, explained it was there or about around 13Feb2021. Her shoulder blade was puffy and tender. The swelling went into the arm and breast. Her breast felt like it weighed 60 pounds and ached. That took a while to go away. The patient explained initially it was also there or about around 13Feb2021 when she noticed she was so fatigue and had the worse headache (Feb2021), she never got nauseous. Her shoulder was still swollen a week ago as of 09Apr2021. She went to a chiropractor for an adjustment and the chiropractor said shoulder was still a little swollen. She had terrible back pain in center of back on 18Feb2021. It was so much that she was afraid something else was going on. The patient stated the swelling it was ongoing up until a few days ago as of 09Apr2021. She still had puffiness around that area when went to chiropractor. For the back discomfort she went to chiropractor for adjustment. She was unsure when that discomfort went away. The achy feeling was ongoing with her muscles and legs until last week as of 09Apr2021 when she started to feel better. Her legs felt rubbery. Her muscles felt achy. She felt better as of 09Apr2021. It had gotten better within the last week as of 09Apr2021. The fatigue was ongoing until last week as of 09Apr2021. The patient felt so bad for month and had no idea what was going on. Her lightheadedness went away last week as of 09Apr2021. She commented she did not want to blame all of this on the shot because she did not know what methylprednisolone did to her. The patient confirmed she had back discomfort. She still had some back discomfort. She started to fell short winded a week before the heart palpitations appeared really bad on 21Mar2021. She did not feel short winded anymore, but she was unsure when that stopped. With her heart palpitation she felt clammy and hot. Therefore, she wen to the ER. The heart palpitations gradually got better, and probably stopped totally last week as of 09Apr2021. She mentioned she had a headache for a good month after the second shot. It started either the 13Feb2021 or 14Feb2021. She stated all her symptoms were getting much better since last week as of 09Apr2021. There was no other treatment beside the methylprednisolone for her symptoms.

The patient confirmed all had been discarded and no lot/exp/NDC to provide. When she was in Emergency room, they did two EKG, drew blood work for the heart, chest x-ray back and front, and verified vital signs which were all good. She went home that same night on 21Mar2021. She went back to doctor on 05Apr2021 and did another chest x-ray and another echocardiogram and everything was fine. The event heart palpitation required a visit to emergency room, the patient was not sure if from the vaccine or methylprednisolone. The patient&#39;s heart rate got to 120, her normal was 80.

She has had to change her diet and cut out vegetables because it made the diarrhea worse. Patient was very depressed. Patient wanted to know if It was reported earlier and why would it cause the ongoing diarrhea. Patient had seen that that it causes sometimes severe diarrhea, but it didn&#39;t say how long it will last. Patient was concerning about if someone need to take an immunosuppressive medication to stop the diarrhea. She was afraid her doctor is going to tell her she needs to take an immunosuppressant medication. It also had stated like, if the Pfizer aware that people have to take medications that shut down the immune system. Upon follow up on 27May2021, reporter stated that, patient was very depressed (on unspecified date) about it.

Bell peppers produce an immune reaction, because they contain a chemical called solanine. patient was eating a lot of bell peppers because the internet said they were healthy and contained a lot of vitamin A. she got an immune reaction to the bell peppers, and the immune reaction produced sores under her sister&#39;s tongue, very painful sores. Patient had side effects happen three or four days later after the vaccine- it started as diarrhea and she thought it would stop.

Patient&#39;s sores were treated with a steroid once and then the sore returned so she went back to the same doctor, and the doctor treated her again with steroids. The second time, the sores went away. At that point, this condition was called burning mouth syndrome, which is on the internet, it was a known condition that is very painful. The doctor diagnosed it as burning mouth syndrome. The diarrhea her sister is experiencing was causing a psychological effect. Reporter stated that, there was no warnings of if a person who has an overactive immune system shouldn&#39;t take the COVID vaccine, there was no kind of warning. Reporter seriousness for all the events were Unspecified. Outcome of all the events were unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Medical history included first pulmonary embolism in 2007; second in 2017 Went to hospital 23Jan2017, left hospital 5 days later. Patient has allergy to aspirin from Dec1982 to ongoing. (Patient Had headache, took Aspirin in 20 minutes had severe reaction-like never seen. Did not go to hospital, never felt throat closing off, coughing, trouble breathing. Skin felt on fire inside and out, took everything off, ice cold shower, skin beet red felt on fire all over, skin looked like elephant skin, wavy; Neighbor nurse gave her liquid Benadryl she drank. Within 15 minutes everything started to clear up, never been near Aspirin again). Patient has allergy to Advil from 1985 To Ongoing. (Had Severe reaction.

On her right hand the numbness was still there. Patient underwent EMG test and a couple weeks later he told her he thought she has carpel tunnel. The concomitant medications include Eliquis taken for pulmonary embolisms (2.5 mg, 2x/day) from unspecified date of Jan2017 to ongoing. Synthroid taken for thyroid problem from unspecified date to unspecified date. Eliquis has to be a pretty powerful drug; don&#39;t know about Pfizer Covid Vaccines, wondered if something interacted because excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand and couldn&#39;t move her fingers took a little over 4 days after Pfizer Covid Vaccine for onset. The patient previously took (years ago) hepatitis vaccine, shingles vaccine, pneumonia vaccine, no reactions to those; she was very cautious did not leave the office too soon after vaccines. She never got flu shot; when she was first in nurses training, she had a reaction to the flu vaccine in like 1960 and was in the emergency room. This retired Registered Nurse was the patient who called regarding her first dose of Pfizer Covid Vaccine. She reported tiredness; eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see; excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand; She couldn&#39;t move her fingers. She also mentioned red mark about the size of a quarter at injection site. She reported she had absolutely no symptoms, nothing after the Pfizer Covid Vaccine other than tiredness, feeling kind of tired, that&#39;s about it. On27May2021 in the afternoon she had onset of her eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see for a few minutes. She washed her eyes out, and the burning and watering went away after she washed them. She had no make-up on, no eye make-up on for a few days at that time. Otherwise, everything was ok. She went to bed last night and during the night she woke up with excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand. She couldn&#39;t move her fingers for maybe a minute or two. Eventually she was able to move her fingers a little, then more and more and the event stopped, she kind of went back to normal and fell asleep. A couple of hours later she had the same event reoccur, just down to the hand, all 10 fingers, couldn&#39;t move them for a few minutes and then after that she could, they seemed to be ok, and she fell asleep again. Whether event started 27May2021 or 28May2021 is unknown, unknown onset times. She has been fined all day. She has written checks out, made meals, coffee, washed and dressed herself, had no other problems. At her age it was hard to tell when the tiredness started regarding time of onset. Thinks in the evening of 24May2021 she felt onset, tired and the next day on 25May2021 she had a couple episodes where her arms felt really heavy just for a short time maybe 30 seconds and then the episodes went away and she just felt tired. 26May2021 she noticed she was not as tired, and yesterday and today improved, feeling pretty good. Seriousness of all the events was not specified by reporter. The outcome of the events eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see for a few minutes was recovered on 27May2021. Time of onset: late morning, probably about 11:00-11:30 really burned, then eyes started to really, really water. She was familiar with her house so she held onto furniture to get to the bathroom and as soon as she rinsed her eyes out event never happened again. Her eyes are not bothering her.The outcome of excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand and couldn&#39;t move her fingers was resolved on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the event tiredness and red mark about the size of a quarter at injection site was recovering.  Follow up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on close temporal association the causal association between the reported event she almost could not see for a few minutes with the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The contributory effect of the patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications also need to be considered. The case will be reassessed should the additional information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 79-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0153) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 03Jun2021 13:00 (at the age of 79-years-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included her first cataract surgery on her right eye, and they found out she had glaucoma. She got a slight infection which is unusual after cataract surgery. She weighs around 188. She is trying to be healthier in general. She had so much going on in 2020, like everybody else. Her sister was really ill and she passed away She and her daughter were planning to fly in August and wanted to be fully vaccinated before they fly. She had been through this before as a child when she had the polio vaccine and there are people she knows got polio who are still affect by it as adults. She is also on blood thinners. She got good reports from her eye doctor. She had no eye pressure. A couple days later she saw her primary doctor and everything was good there. She sees her cardiologist on 17Jun2021. The main thing is she had been on blood thinners since Apr2017. She hopes she doesn&#39;t have to be on them for the rest of her life, but it&#39;s a possibility. She has to take that twice a day. She also takes a high blood pressure medicine and thyroid medication. She was told to tell the nurse to use a smaller needle. She has arthritis in both of her knees which is kind of hereditary. She had a fall after the campfire. They evacuated, and when they came back and fell in a store. She is getting physical therapy. The Pradaxa is quite expensive. She takes it twice a day. She keeps a log. This medication can&#39;t have air reach it, so she can&#39;t use a pill box with that. She keeps a journal and logs her medicines. She takes eye drops for her glaucoma. She takes a drop in both eyes before bedtime. It gives it a chance to rest and for the drops to absorb. She stated that diabetes runs in her family. On 20Mar2021 she had her first cataract surgery, so they gave her anesthesia for that. Glaucoma, cataract, arthritis, fall. Concomitant medication(s) included dabigatran etexilate mesilate (PRADAXA) taken for anticoagulant therapy from Apr2017 and ongoing, unspecified high blood pressure medication, thyroid medication and eye drops for glaucoma in both eyes before bedtime which would give a chance to rest and for the drops to absorb. Historical vaccination included polio vaccine.  On 03Jun2021, It started that day she had the vaccine. Her vaccine was at 13:00. It was 104 that day so she stayed hydrated and drank a lot of water. She came home and had a little soreness. She was surprised she didn&#39;t have any big noticeable difference. With her arm soreness she was surprised it hurt in her shoulder. If she touches the site she can feel that, but she was okay and was well. On 04Jun2021 she had a headache the next day, and she did take Tylenol. She tried to prolong taking the Tylenol because she heard not to take Tylenol before the vaccine or too soon afterwards to give the vaccine a chance to do its thing. She went ahead and took Tylenol and it worked. It kicked in, and her headache went away the same day. She heard from other people that is was a classic symptom. Her symptoms weren&#39;t something she had to stay in bed for. She had a little anxiety before she had the vaccine. She read up as much as she could and decided on Pfizer because she had spoken with other people who had Pfizer. She will continue to wear a mask, she is really good at that. Outcome of the event headache was recovered on 04Jun2021. Outcome of other events it was recovering.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: unknown) via unspecified route of administration in arm left on 06Mar2021at 11:00 (at the age of 79-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history of the patient included high blood pressure, sinus issues. Family Medical History included that her daughter has had reaction to medications, she had flu vaccine and she ended up in the emergency department, she had trouble breathing. Concomitant medications included atenolol started a long time ago taken for high blood pressure. Patient previously used clindamycin as in her age she occasionally breaks. Patient previously received flu vaccine in 2009 for immunization and had a reaction. She had the Flu vaccine for many years and the one she had trouble with was a vaccine without preservatives. On 06Mar2021, seven hours after receiving first dose of vaccination, in the evening patient noticed that her mouth started to burn, accidentally pinched her arm and the pain was more than expected and it left a bruise. On 12Mar2021, patient experienced sinus issues. On 20Mar2021, patient experienced that her legs were heavy and felt like they were weighted, which made it difficult for her to walk. On 22Mar2021, patient experienced burning pain on her lower lips, specifically in the space between the lip and the teeth. There was also burning pain in the face, in the arm and her neck-chest area, which caused great mental distress, a huge emotional toll, specifically being upset and devastated, lack of sleep, and weight lost due to lost of appetite with 5 pounds being lost within 2 weeks of these side effects. On an unspecified date in 2021, patient experienced hypersensitivity reaction. Patient stated that when she was changing her outfit she accidentally pinched her arm and the pain was more than expected and it left a bruise. About 7 hours after, she noticed that her mouth started to burn. She mentioned that she also had pineapple that day and was not sure if it was caused by the vaccine. On the 09Mar2021, she consulted a nurse practitioner who said that the burning may have been caused by the Pineapple. On 10Mar2021, she consulted her allergologist and got tested for a pineapple allergy. The results came in on 15Mar2021 and they came back negative for the allergy, but her allergologist mentioned that pineapple can still irritate the mouth. On 18Mar2021, she consulted with her Primary in which she was given magic mouthwash that made it worse. She was made to continue her benadryl and aspirin spray. On 20Mar2021, that Saturday night, as she was walking, she felt that her legs were heavy and felt like they were weighted, which made it difficult for her to walk. It lasted for about 20-30 minutes before subsiding. Last Monday, 22Mar2021 she really started to notice the burning pain on her lower lips, specifically in the space between the lip and the teeth. There was also burning pain in the face, in the arm and her neck-chest area. She described it as not constant but comes and goes. On 25Mar2021, she consulted with her primary again in which she was recommended not to get the 2nd dose of the vaccine and her side effects lean to a more neurologic cause. The doctor mentioned that the vaccine was still too new. These side effects has caused great mental distress, a huge emotional toll, specifically being upset and devastated, lack of sleep, and weight lost due to lost of appetite with 5 pounds being lost within 2 weeks of these side effects. She said that has not been fun. it has been horrible, and she would choose dying over this burning sensation in the mouth. Patient visited physician Office, 3 times and allergist did it virtually. Reportedly, after eating dinner she was eating pineapple from a can. She had the can and tried it. She had not had pineapple in a long time. While sitting in her recliner, she experienced her mouth burning. She added that began about an hour and a half after eating the pineapple and it has lasted for approximately 2 weeks. It was not constant all the time. She did not know at the time if the burning in the mouth was related to the pineapple. Caller added they thought it was the pineapple causing this. Last Sunday, the caller indicated that it was leaving and going away. Caller saw her new primary medical doctor on 09Mar2021. The Nurse Practitioner said it was probably the pineapple, She started her on Benadryl. Manufacturer was unknown to caller. Caller took 2 tablets on 09Mar2021 and stopped taking it on 10Mar2021. She restarted taking the Benadryl on about 14Mar2021. Caller stated she was primarily calling and asking because on Monday, 22Mar2021 she started having burning in her face and had burning in her arm.  Caller reported the burning in her arm was not from the vaccine and she thought it was caused by her blood pressure cuff.  Caller took her own blood pressure. Burning was better today, she still had burning in her arm. She took Zyrtec as instructed by her physician twice a day. She took a half tablet on 10Mar2021 through 13Mar2021. She was taking half a tablet in the morning and a half tablet at bedtime. Caller added that the Zyrtec made her feel unsteady and it made her sleepy. She did not tolerate it. Dose was 10mg. She has recovered completely from unsteady and being sleepy with Zyrtec. Caller took Tylenol because she was having sinus issues. She did not have the manufacturer, she took it on 12 and 20, two times. Its 325mg, by mouth, the regular strength. Caller saw an allergist on 10Mar2021 who tested her for pineapple allergy. The Allergist called on 15Mar2021 and reported she was not allergic to pineapple. Allergy was also tested for egg white, milk, wheat, corn, peanut, soybean, potato, yeast, and tomato. All resulted as negative. Benadryl: took 2 times in 09Mar2021. Caller restarted Benadryl and took it on 14Mar2021-17Mar2021. These days she only took it in the evening. She took 25 mg at night. Then she took Flonase, twice, on the 17th and 18th. Its over the counter. Lot number: TE8G, caller doesnt have box to provide UPC, stated there was another number of 0140592, expiry Mar2021. Dose was 27.5mcg per spray, spray into each nostril. When providing strength, states writing was so small for her to see. Gets a magnifying glass to confirm strength, states it&#39;s with her age. The doctor also suggested for the caller to try Afrin spray on 18Mar2021.  Caller started it on 20Mar2021 and used it only once. She didnt like it. Caller said at her age she occasionally breaks out and uses Clindamycin for that. Dermatologist has her using Clindamycin 1 per cent pledgets. Applied twice to face once daily, She stopped 20Mar2021. Given Magic Mouthwash, which was in a pharmacy bottle, she took it once on 18Mar2021, but stopped. It was 5-10ml swish and spit. It made things worse and did not improve it. The doctor forgot to give her a measuring cup, and caller thought she told her a teaspoon. Caller added she tried using a warm cloth on her sinus area and her skin felt like a sunburn. The cloth left a red area around her cheek. Then this Sunday, after using the pledgets, went for a walk, next day noticed her face was really burned, not just face, her neck, arms, but she was not exposed, but had a burning pain, and she still continued to have it.  She asked the dermatologist if this could be caused from the Clindamycin. The dermatologist told her no. She took a walk on Saturday and did not know if she was dehydrated.  She felt like there were weights on her feet as she walked. It lasted 30 minutes. The burning in mouth started 7 hours after the first dose and it had improved. Therapeutic measures taken in response to the events included Benadryl, Zyrtec, Tylenol, Flonase, Afrin spray, clindamycin, magic mouthwash. Outcome of the events &#34;mouth started to burn/burning in mouth&#34; and &#34;sinus issues&#34; were ongoing-not recovered and for all other events were unknown at the time of report.

                                                Well like I said, I woke up and my arm after the shot was sore. The joint was bothering me, and I thought that it was a side effect of the shot and after about a week I had a little bit of movement but still pain. So later in May I finally called the orthopedic doctor. I got an MRI and he said it was a significant tear to the rotator cuff. I did not do anything so I do not know what or how it happened. I just figured it was the COVID vaccine, although the doctor thought it was highly unlikely. I had surgery to repair it on May the 20th 2021, at local hospital. I came home that night after the surgery. The doctor gave me tramadol for the pain as well. I will have another MRI next week, in mid-July 2021.

Also , I developed an itchy pimply rash on my lower back that is  troublesome and for which I am using benedryl.  The asprin  nor the aleve seem to help the neck.  The itchy is driving me nuts--benedryl helps a little.  SHOULD I GET MY SECOND DOSE WHICH IS DUE FEBRUARY 10?

AN 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: 30Jun2021) intramuscularly in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at 13:00 (at the age of 80-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included highly sensitive and highly allergic to everything from food to medicine; had been through near death with allergies; allergic to penicillin, iodine and shellfish; high blood pressure, eye disorder (unspecified), allergies with her sinuses. Concomitant medications were not reported, but the patient took unspecified high blood pressure and eye medication. The patient previously took dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride (DARVON), ether and castor oil and experienced allergies; sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) for severe acute sinusitis on Jan2021 (about a month ago). On 11Feb2021 at 13:20, the patient start feeling dizzy and faint like, and felt a little tired. She came home and went to bed and on 11Feb2021, had itching on the right shoulder (where she had the vaccine) and on the right side of the arm near the elbow, the middle part of the stomach and the neck (itching came and went) and later, her sinuses started to drain. On 12Feb2021, the patient&#39;s feet felt stiff and the bone in the right leg felt strange. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient had pain in the shoulder. The patient queried if she can take aspirin for the pain in the shoulder and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) if the itching comes back. The clinical outcome of pain in the shoulder was unknown, of &#34;itching on right side of arm near elbow, middle part of stomach and neck&#34;, &#34;feeling dizzy and faint like&#34;, tired, sinuses started to drain, &#34;feet felt stiff and bone in right leg felt strange&#34; and &#34;itching on the right shoulder (where she had the vaccine)&#34; was resolving.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

The patient stated that the main thing was the neuropathy thing, it felt like she was sitting on her hand and that persisted, but it was 90 percent better and she thinks it will go away. The neuropathy feeling was ongoing but much less, it was improved it happens only if she squeezes her hand so it was much less and she hoped it just dissipates. The patient&#39;s main concern was the neuropathy and it has improved a great deal. The patient mentioned with the arm the pain and movement in that arm has worsened since the injection (Feb2021). The worsened pain and movement has persisted about the same since she noticed it. The patient informed that was the joint she guessed, because she broke the elbow.

The patient basically is maintained in the nursing home in this state of being bed-bound and nonverbal.  She was recently transferred to Rehab after she developed a stage IV sacral ulcer at a previous nursing home.  The patient had been seeing wound care and doing very well.  Her stage IV sacral ulcer had been healed to a stage II.  She had been gaining weight.  Unfortunately, at her wound care appointment yesterday the wound had decompensated a little bit and had started to drain some purulent material.  It also enlarged in size a little bit.  I was called yesterday afternoon and the nursing home reported the patient was not wanting to eat or drink.  Lab work showed a sodium of 170 and creatinine consistent with acute kidney injury.  She also appeared to have a urinary tract infection.  Because of her critical labs she was sent to the nursing home.  The patient was evaluated in the nursing home and then admitted to the floor.  She was given Zosyn and vancomycin and started on IV fluids.  The emergency room physician did counsel the family that the prognosis was very grim.  The patient has done reasonably well overnight.  She has been grimacing quite a bit and the family has decided they just want her kept comfortable    comfort care during admission

This 80-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Covid shot, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3246; NDC number: Unknown; Expiry Date: Unknown) from an intramuscular route of administration via left arm on 02Feb2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history included ear ache in right ear and cold. She explained she did have an ear ache in right ear, she figured she must have had a cold. She was using ear drops and it just sort of went away. She clarified this was prior to the vaccine. It started over a week or 10 days ago, she guesses. She doesn&#39;t recall. She believes the ear ache was cleared by Tuesday before receiving the vaccine. The patient was received unknown concomitant medications. No other vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient experienced pain in the neck that makes it hard for her to move it from side to side and pain down her neck on her right side on 04Feb2021. The patient had the first COVID-19 shot last Tuesday evening and everything was fine. Probably on Thursday she started getting pain down her back, clarified as her neck, on her right side. Like, she can&#39;t hardly turn her head left or right without turning her whole body. Patient declined to include a healthcare professional for the report. She confirms she started having pain in her neck on the right side. She clarifies she had an ultrasound last Friday because they were concerned with her liver. They called that night and that was fine. However, Friday morning when she went in for that appointment, she really didn&#39;t have any pain in her neck. Therefore, it had to have been after. It must have actually started either Friday night or Saturday. Caller explains she paid no attention to the pain until yesterday so she thought she would call today. She was not sure about vaccination time stated had a 7 o&#39;clock appointment, so maybe by 7:30-7:45PM. The outcome of events was reported as not recovered.

The test came back &#39;negative&#39; -- I did not have an active case of Covid.  The symptoms I was experiencing finally calmed down about Friday - the 26th and by Sunday, they were over.  It was almost like a further delayed adverse reaction to my final March 6th 2nd dosage shot although the muscle &amp; joint aches and fatigue were worse than just after the 2nd shot?

This has continued for six weeks though there were also periods when I was symptom free. I hope that my immune system has returned to normal. I have not heard of these symptoms reported previously.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown. Date of second shot was 17Mar2021, it was reported patient had got the both shot of covid vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021404239 similar report from same reporter

Medical history included Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (states she was diagnosed about 40 years ago), Allergies, lung collapses (due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), preemie, no fusion in her eyes (States she sees out of one eye most of the time), does not retain sodium and potassium (related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), egg allergy.

Concomitant medication included potassium as does not retain potassium; spironolactone; a list of medications. Her mom got her 2nd dose on Sunday and is in the process of needing to report that. She ended up with severe gut, lower abdominal, intestinal pain and bloating along with other normal things. States she saw her doctor yesterday and he believes it could be caused by the Propylene Glycol in the vaccine. Her mother received her shot at 3pm on 4Apr2021 and does not know which arm. Her symptoms started around 8:30 with body aches everywhere, a severe headache, her bones and joints were hurting so bad she couldn&#39;t barely walk much, she made it to the bathroom and that was it, and nausea. Caller states by 10 her mom had hard cramping, that it started at 8:30 with cramping in her abdomen and severe bloating. States her mom could still void but it was pressure tying to go and caused severe pain and abdominal pain was causing pain to void. Caller provides that her mom continues the same until Tuesday morning and then the intestinal cramping and bloating is still continuing now and it&#39;s more primarily her lower left area as of Wednesday. She has a big history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and her doctor that she met with yesterday feels this is probably from the propylene glycol component that caused the flare up, as she usually doesn&#39;t have this and he is hoping it will calm down in about a week. Her mom also couldn&#39;t eat or anything until Tuesday. She was down all of Sunday night and Monday for about 36 hours. Stated the voiding is somewhat better but not much better and the rest of the symptoms are consolidated and persisting. Reporter stated her mom can&#39;t go without her medications. Her mom did a virtual doctor visit and will follow up later this week. Her mother got the second dose of the vaccine and had severe intestinal pain, headache, joint pain, nausea, abdominal pain.

Three days after that, on 1/29/2021, I became quite ill.  I had sudden onset of total body weakness, I was unable to sleep for 4 days, I developed a constant frontal headache, I felt like my body was electrified, my eyes started twitching and feeling like my eyelids were being pulled, my face felt like it was being pulled on one side, my nose became runny and hasn&#39;t stopped.   To this day I have no energy and am not like my old self before the shot.  I have gone downhill incredibly fast.  My doctors don&#39;t know what to do with me and I don&#39;t think things are going to get better.  My day to day life is a struggle.  I have no energy to do things.    One of the only things I have not had is a fever.    My eye doctor told me he thinks I had a GROSS IMMUNE SYSTEM REACTION to the vaccine.   0 I would appreciate it if there is anything you can do to help me.    Thank you,

An 80-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in deltoid right on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) as unknown, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter stated that since then (having both doses of the vaccine), she has been to the emergency room 4 different times experiencing side effects. She has a metallic taste and horrible smell that she experienced in which it made her not want to eat or drink. She has minor hallucinations, chills, joint pain, and her tissue is tender. Her joint pain has improved. Then stated, &#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to die from it.&#34; She asked if anyone has reported these reactions previously and what should she do about them. Her family physician&#39;s nurse looked up a study in which 11% of the patients were experiencing a metallic taste. Also stated, &#34;This is very discouraging and depressing.&#34; The outcome of the event joint pain was recovering while of the rest was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of minor hallucinations cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient is an 80 y/o right handed female who is totally independent at baseline who received her Pfizer vaccine out of the country (1st dose 2/19/21, 2nd dose 3/12/21).  She was reactive to both shots, reporting arthralgias, headache, low grade fever, chills. She had a rise in blood pressure later during the day of her shot as well as the next day (up to 180/70, from baseline of 130/70). She also had an episode of epistaxis several days after her first shot.  She traveled independently out of the country on 3/31/21 to visit her son on a leisure trip. On 4/5/21 she had headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, and did not feel well, and her systolic BP was 198, after which she took additional 40 mg of lisinopril.   Her BP subsequently decreased to systolic BP of 130 mm Hg on 4/5/21, but over the next few days she had labile BP with a range of BP of 125 to 171/ 58 - 68.  She was meticulous in checking and recording her BP several times a day, and she increased her lisinopril dose to 40 mg po qd from 20 mg po qd given the higher than usual blood pressure range.  On 4/10/21 her BP was as follows: 6:30 am, 148/60 (she took her daily lisinopril 20 mg po); 11:30 am:  132/52; 3 pm: 171/69 (she took additional lisinopril 20 mg po) after which her systolic BP decreased to 130. Then around 6:20 pm the same day (4/10/21), she had acute onset of headache, vomiting, left sided weakness, SBP 220, and was witnessed to have rapid change in mental status. There was no antecedent trauma to the head. EMTs were called immediately and she had loss of consciousness during the ambulance ride to the ED, after about 20 minutes of symptom onset, with agonal breathing and bradycardia to the 40s, but never lost her pulse. Upon arrival to the ED out of the country, her Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, she was rapidly intubated and stabilized. Head CT demonstrated massive intraparenchymal hemorrhage (140 cc) within the R temporal parietal and occipital lobes, with cerebral edema and 14 mm midline shift, associated with small subdural hematoma and small intraventricular hemorrhage within the temporal horn and body of the R lateral ventricle. They reported hyperdense &#34;spot sign&#34; within the intraparenchymal hematoma compatible with active hemorrhage, no evidence of venous thrombosis, no masses, no arteriovenous malformations. She had 2.5 mm aneurysm right  that was thought to be incidental finding unrelated to her event. She was taken emergently to the OR on 4/10/2021 for decompressive R hemicraniectomy, which she underwent successfully with minimal blood loss.  She had no coagulopathy and her platelets and hemoglobin were normal. She remained in the Neuro ICU for 3 weeks. She received a tracheostomy two weeks after her presentation, and was weaned off the ventilator. She is breathing spontaneously after 5 weeks from presentation. She remains in coma or minimally conscious state, with GCS score of 5-6 as of 5/13/2021.

                                                She is shrinking.; left shoulder was causing her trouble; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 80-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6199), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) as, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure (she has had it for years), ongoing diabetes (she has had it for years), ongoing uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (she has only used it for the last 3 years), pain in her shoulder and glenohumeral arthritis. Concomitant medication was not reported. Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 11Feb2021 as, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced left shoulder was causing her trouble and Received Cortisone shot 2 days before receiving the Covid vaccine. The patient previously took cortisone on 02Mar2021, received at doctor&#39;s office administration in the right arm for shoulder pain. The patient had she is shrinking and left shoulder was causing her trouble on an unspecified date in Mar2021. It was reported that the patient had both doses in her right arm because her left shoulder was causing her trouble. It was reported that the patient tooks a lot of medications but nothing she thought it was relevant. On 02Mar2021, the patient received cortisone shot to the right arm for shoulder arm. The patient was considered high risk and she did not worry as much about that as she did about the Cortisone. The patient wanted to know if she would negated her second dose by agreeing to the cortisone shot. she stated her physician assured that her there would be no problem. On an unknown date, before vaccination the patient underwent lab tests which included X-ray and resulted with glenohumeral arthritis in her shoulder. The physician stated that because of glenohumeral arthritis, the patient was having shoulder pain and it was started about 8 or 9 months ago. On an unknown date in Mar2021, the patient experienced freezing up. The patient also would like to know if booster doses of the Pfizer-Biontech Covid19 vaccine are recommended. She wanted to know if it was safe for her to go to a party with other fully vaccinated people, without masks. When the Patient took the Covid vaccination, the whole thing turned into a big circus. It was snowing and she had postponed her appointment with her physician for terrible pain in her shoulder. She had to cancel the appointment 4 times because of snow but she finally went on 02Mar2021 and got a Cortisone shot. She thought she should wait and come back to get the Cortisone shot because she was going to get her second Pfizer vaccine in 2 days, but her physician assured her that nothing would happen. After he gave her the Cortisone shot, she did research and it said she shouldn&#39;t do it. The patient called Pfizer and a woman said to take the shot anyway because it was better to take it on time than to wait. The patient question was how good was her immunity and she asked how good her protection would be. She called when she did not know whether to postpone or take the vaccination and the woman suggested to take the shot. The woman said the scheduling of the shot was more important since they had no research on how the Cortisone affected the shot. She was wondering in order to research if Pfizer would want to take a test to see her coverage. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 80-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for Injection, Batch/Lot number: EP1533 and Expiration date Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Mar2021 (at the age of 80-year-old) and first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for Injection, Batch/Lot number: EN6205 and Expiration date Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 09Mar2021 (at the age of 80-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient received enoxolone, glycol salicylate, levomenthol, tocopheryl acetate (SALONPAS 30) from Jun2021 and permanently discontinued for pain, ibuprofen (IBUPROFEN) from an unknown date and ongoing for pain, codeine (CODEINE), from and unknown date and ongoing for pain and nerve ending blocking medication for an unknown indication from Jun2021 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect If applicable, list of all vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect were reported as none. The patient has been having severe pain that was increasingly getting worse. Has been to the emergency room twice and seen multiple doctors and various specialists and given multiple drugs for relief that have not helped. They have scheduled to see a pain specialist in next week. At that time they really had not tried it to the vaccine at all. Costochondritis has been suggested and various other related spine issues and stuff. Stated her pain was getting severely and progressively worse and she could not sleep at night and stayed up all night. The pain pill given, it was just not lasting long enough and she only took it once a day and gets a little relief, but no sleep and up all night. Has been alternating heat and ice and it did not do it. They have not been able to sleep 80-90% of the nights and was up if not part but all night. It became worse as time gone on and they were desperate. They used the Salonpas and one burned her skin so they quit those about 2 weeks ago, sometime early June. The area has improved when she quit using those, but the skin was still sensitive and rough feeling. They had one medication prescribed when went to the emergency room, but she ran out of them and another medication. Was told she did not need to use the prescription ones and to used the over the counter ones and so they bought the Salonpas and it burned her. She was given anti-inflammatories and used Tylenol in the early stages and it helped a little bit, but not doing it now since given a pain medication. Unable to provide the name of anti-inflammatories or the Tylenol UPC, Lot, and expiries. Believes one of the anti-inflammatories may have been a supped up Ibuprofen, but could not recall, but it did not help. They believed the pain medication may have Codeine in it because it was only prescribed for a little bit at a time. It&#39;s one of those addicting type things. Has tried taking this pain medication in the evening to sleep, but that didn&#39;t work and she had so much pain in the morning. Has now been taking them in the morning and that lasts for 8 hours, but she was not allowed to take anymore until the next morning. The relevant tests were reported as none.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is requested.

By Sunday afternoon, less discomfort, but still a headache. During this discomfort time, I would take 2 Tylenol (500 mg), which relieved it. Before I settled down for the night, I took 1 Tylenol and when I woke up at 3:00 a.m., the ache was not there (the Tylenol would have worn off by then). Monday a.m. ... could walk much better. The headache and the constant muscle ache are gone.  Nurse called; I am to keep watch, and if there are any changes for the worse, I will go into the Dr.&#39;s office.

I had never felt pain in my hips and was alarmed by it. I didn&#39;t associate the pain with the COVID-19 vaccination until Jan. 22, when I heard a doctor in a video from the Health Department talking about the vaccinations. The city communication system had sent the link to me, unrequested, in an email. The doctor listed possible side effects, including hip pain. I searched the internet for lists of side effects, although I had read them in newspaper reports and had heard them in coverage of the pandemic and vaccines. I was unaware of hip pain specifically or joint pain being on the list.

Medical history included knee pain from an unknown date. The patient clarified she had been dealing with this knee pain prior to receiving her first dose of the vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the vaccine on Friday (15Jan2021) and she had a knee that was giving her a fit. She was not sure if she had twisted it or if it was arthritis. She just wanted to know if there were any over the counter medications she can take such as Tylenol or Ibuprofen that she could take for knee pain that will not interfere with vaccine. She confirmed it was her knee, she thought its arthritis, it had swelled up before but it was very painful, and she was wondering if there was any medications that might be in fair with this vaccine such as Tylenol or Ibuprofen or anything like that. She said this morning it was a little better after being off it last night, it was not as painful this morning. She said previously she had been taking Tylenol or Ibuprofen and it would help it a great deal but she wanted to check since she had the first shot Friday to see if taking that would interfere with anything. The action taken in response to the events for ibuprofen and paracetamol was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation diagnosed about 25 years ago, Canker sore on 18Jan2021 (she did go the doctor for that and the doctor urged her to rinse it with salt water to she&#39;s been doing that), some soreness in her month on 18Jan2021, gout reaction. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. No Pfizer vaccine was administered on the same date. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. The patient got a reaction that she thought should be noted. She has had a very slight history of gout. She woke up this morning on 21Jan2021 and her big toes hurt. She knew that this was a symptom of what she had had in the past which was gout. The patient confirmed her big toes hurting was pretty much staying the same. It&#39;s not that uncomfortable. She knew from past experience that this was what happens, like when she ate certain foods like seafood or whatever, she would have this kind of gout reaction.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 21Jan2021 08:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included lymphoma from 2018. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer. The patient previously took rituxan for lymphoma (Reported she had been in remission for a little over a year. She said she had received only 4 Rituxan infusions for the lymphoma before she went into remission). 12 hours post injection: she &#34;experienced significant rigors and shaking, muscle and joint aches, her equilibrium was off at some point, she was tired, had generalized pain, and chills&#34;. She also confirmed feeling better.  She stated she heard the the second dose of the vaccine caused more reaction than the first dose and would like to validate the information. She explained the first instance she experienced rigors was after a lymphoma treatment. She believed the rigors lasted &#34;12 hours&#34; but was not certain because she &#34;fell asleep and got warmed&#34;. The patient felt great all day on 21Jan2021 after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said almost exactly 12 hours later, she started to have rigors. She was shaking so hard that her hands and body were jerking. Her muscles and joints were hurting, her equilibrium was off, she ached all over, she had pain, felt tired, and she had chills. The rigors started first. She said she felt really cold at the same time, so she went to bed and covered up, trying to get warmed. She fell asleep for awhile, and then woke up and went to the bathroom. When she went to get out of bed to go to the bathroom, she stood up, and every bone and muscle in her body hurt. She said she was aching all over, and her equilibrium was off. She didn&#39;t feel like getting up, and finally went to sleep to get the rigors to stop. She felt cold all the time now, but the rest of her symptoms had improved. She said it seemed like the muscle in her right leg was still pretty sore. She said she recovered from the rigors completely. She had rigors once before when she had an infusion. She clarified the infusion was Rituxan. She said she had a reaction to her first treatment of Rituxan. She said she had rigors when the Rituxan infusion was first started. She was given a couple things (but she didn&#39;t know what those things were), and she stopped shaking. She said the infusion staff waited a few minutes and tried to restart the Rituxan infusion, but she would have rigors again. She said the infusion staff tried slowing down the Rituxan infusion rate, as well. She said the Rituxan infusion normally takes 2 hours, but after 8 hours, she had only got about 20% of the Rituxan infusion, before the Rituxan infusion was stopped. She stated she had 3 subsequent Rituxan infusions at later dates, and did not have any problems with those infusions. Her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine was administered high up in the muscle of her left arm, close to the shoulder joint. She said the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection didn&#39;t hurt, and her left arm never got sore. She said on 30Dec2020 she had lab work done for her oncologist. She went about every other month for blood work to make sure she was still in remission. She saw her oncologist on 06Jan2021, and her oncologist said her blood work looked pretty good and was better. She asked her oncologist about the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her oncologist said she definitely wanted her to get the COVID-19 Vaccine. Her next appointment with her oncologist was in Mar2021. She said she had been seeing her oncologist every month, but her oncologist this time, wanted to try seeing her after 2 months. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of events rigors, shaking was recovered in Jan2021. The outcome of events muscle and joint aches/her muscles hurt, equilibrium was off, aching all over, tired, bone and muscle in her body hurt, hands and body were jerking was recovering. The outcome of event feels cold was not recovered.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

As I examined the area several times during the next couple of hours I noticed a lump.  The lump was moveable, but seemed about the size of a nickle.  It scared me even though it was not actually in my breast.  The doctor told me since it was moveable and felt smooth he thought it to be a reaction to the Covid vaccine, but ordered a mammogram.  I called for the mammogram and was told I could not have one until 4 weeks after the 2nd shot.  I have a mammogram scheduled 3/26/2021.

I returned home and within the hour I began to feel &#34;very tired&#39; and lay down in my bed.  Within minutes, my left thump had spasms and painful cramping and &#34;froze&#34; I massaged my thump for about 5 minutes and the pain subsided.  I then had painful cramping in my left calf and then the entire leg which then followed by Muscle pain and cramping in both legs.  I was told that I should exercise, so I went for a long walk.  When I returned home, i felt even worse so I went back to bed. Headaches began. I had flu-like symptoms (chills and discomfort) I covered my self with two blankets and drank lots of water and took an Aleve.which upset my stomach.  3/03 (the next morning), my usual sinus stuffiness was Gone! and I could breathe better than i have in a long time (by days end my sinusitis had returned) and so had my headache. Today 3/04 I still feel exhausted and I have swelling, puffs under my eyes (not usual) and occasional headaches.  My Left Arm (area of the inoculation) Has Never Been Painful!!!!!!

Patient had an allergic reaction to the swine flu vaccine in 1979-1980. Patient had muscular problems that resulted from the Swine Flu shot. She had weakened muscle. Most of the time she was okay, but she was more prone to getting back pain and stuff, not pain on her side and on the front side like she has now. Patient wanted to know if the swine flu shot and the covid 19 vaccine had similar ingredients. The Swine Flu shot was back in 1979 or 1980. This is the only type of flu vaccination she has ever had. She did not take more after that. She does not have a lot number to provide. She does know though, that a lot of people at that time came down with (Name) from that vaccine. With this vaccine, nobody seems to be getting strong side effects from it. No Other Products. Patient History reported as No. No Investigation Assessment. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced pain in her arm statin she could not raise her arm for a day. Her arm bothered her: she could not lift her arm on 30Jan2021and recovered on 31Jan2021. The patient experienced a day later pain and inflammation on her right side of waist and in the back down in to pelvis, ovary and groin area muscle with not recovered (reported as worsened). Caller stated that it was quite painful describing the pain as muscle pain and inflammation. Caller stated that this pain had not gone away. Caller stated she was due for her second dose and wanted to know if she should get the second dose based on her side effects to the first dose. The patient was having to take anti-inflammatory medications for the pain associated with her side effects to the covid 19 vaccine. Patient thought she had a reaction to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. The day after she had the usual side effect of her arm bothering her. Then she started to experience pain and inflammation around her right side from the waist area down to the front of her pelvis to her groin muscle. It seems like pain and inflammation. It has not gone away. If patient stays home and did nothing she felt a little better. If she took an anti inflammatory she also felt a little better. If she was going out and doing something it flares up. That was why she felt it was muscular, it felt inflamed. Caller stated that it overall had gotten worse in the last few days. She was doing more things than the first couple of days. Treatment: The anti inflammatory was Diclofenac 25mg. She had also been taking Tylenol at night. She said that it does not make the pain completely go away, but it helps keep the pain tolerable. Did not have either of these medications on hand to provide the lot numbers. The outcome of event Her arm bothered her: she could not lift her arm was recovered on 31Jan2021, of other events was not recovered.

An 81-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration, on 27Jan2021 at 11:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization; and rosuvastatin, via an unspecified route of administration, in Feb2021 for 3 days, at an unspecified dose and frequency, for blood cholesterol. The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included ongoing amlodipine for high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s husband was calling about the COVID-19 vaccine and he is not sure if what the patient was experiencing was because of the vaccine or a prescription drug (rosuvastatin) she took but her arm and legs are shaking like jerking and joints are painful on 04Feb2021. The medication the patient&#39;s husband was referring to is rosuvastatin which the patient takes for cholesterol. The patient took this for 3 days and she started feeling weird in Feb2021, so she stopped taking. The patient&#39;s husband not sure what to do since the patient went to the doctor and the doctor did not find anything, she went to the emergency room. The patient was hospitalized for two days. The patient also saw a specialist neurologist who recommended to take more tests, but the patient is waiting for the tests. In 2021, the patient had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). The patient was experiencing joint pain especially in the finger at night still (the joint pain is not in the arm and legs but in her finger). This started a few days later and was still going on. It has stayed the same and some days are better and then some days are worse. The patient was admitted to the hospital in 2021 for 2 days due to events. No treatment was received for the events. The action taken in response to the events for rosuvastatin was permanently withdrawn in Feb2021. The outcome of &#34;Feeling weird&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Joints are painful; joint pain especially in the finger&#34;. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.

                                                After the first vaccine she experienced pain in arm and pain between the eyes. She also had flu like symptoms for approximately 3 days, and unusual bowel movements not diarrhea, not constipated, but not normal and painful.  After second dose had similar reaction bowel issues are still bad and very painful (to the point of vomiting during bowel movements  due to pain). She saw her primary care doctor and was Rx&#39;d a cream.  This has caused her to decrease her eating.  This did not help and she was having loss of visual acuity and started not being able to speak properly so went to the ED  for concern over Strokes.     had 2 MRIs, and determined not to be having a stroke so was released to home.  Sxs seemed to resolve ( like a spell) .   Was still having bowel issues and she also developed a rash from the neck to the groin. So she went to a specialist.   The Rash cleared after about 3 days.   Specialist advised that the sxs were all due to the COVID Vaccine.  Flank pain under the right ribs has also been present, this is not improving,  it is a dull pain that seems to be worsening  ( the bowel seems to be about back to normal now) She is planning on speaking with her PCP about the right flank pain.

                                                She got the vaccine, and had no reactions at all other than perhaps a chill.  About  2-3 weeks later on 3/7/21 she started experiencing what they are calling muscle confusions.  She feels a tapping sensation on her biceps and triceps and then starts with muscle cramps running down her right arm creating her fingers to cringe or come together or contract.  This then travels down to her right leg to her quadriceps which cramps and convulse and travels to her calves which tighten up like a Charlie Horse and down her toes to where they contract as well.  They are intermittent, scattered and sporadic.  Sometimes she will get 2-3 a day, and then none at all and then a few days later a couple more.   These contractions last 3-5 minutes.  She had COVID back in April of 2020 and was hospitalized until August of 2020 with that.  During that time she was on a ventilator for 60 days and on a breathing tube and coded and was out for about 30 minutes.  She had an EEG of her brain in September and told that she was fine.  her neurologist felt she should have another one due to these symptoms, and she had that and everything was normal.  The doctor prescribed 500 mg twice a day of Levetiracetam.   The seizures kind of regress a little and then they came back and he upped that medication to 1000 mg twice a day.  The seizures still continue and have continued but is still taking the medication.  He felt that she should know see an epileptic specialist and they have an APT for 5/27/21.   These episodes are exhausting and wear her out.   She was going to PT due to the weakness from being in the hospital for so long, and now she is fearful if she is going to fall and uses a walker and is having a setback in that progress.  She is to continue therapy at home for now and to follow up with the Epilepsy specialist.

                                                shingles; burning bumps; rash/breaking out spot; back ache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) and additional consumer (patient&#39;s daughter). An 81-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in right arm on 26Feb2021 13:45 (lot number: EN6198) at the age of 81 years old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoporosis and macular degeneration in both eyes. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccination included shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) on an unspecified date (about 5 years ago) for immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine four weeks prior to COVID vaccine. Patient mentioned she received her first COVID-19 vaccine on 26Feb2021. Then on 02Mar2021, she started having a back ache. Then by Friday, 05Mar2021 she started breaking out on her right side. She thought at first it was due to her using a heating pad for her back which was sore. Then on Sunday morning on 07Mar2021 she noticed a new breaking out area on her stomach. She thought she might have shingles. She was seen at her primary care doctor on 08Mar2021 and was told it was shingles. She was prescribed an antiviral drug now. She wanted to know if she should get the second COVID-19 shot and if the antiviral drug affect her getting the second shot. Patient noticed the breaking out on her right side towards her stomach and it may have started a day earlier. If it started on her back, she wasn&#39;t aware and she didn&#39;t feel it until Friday 05Mar2021. The breaking out started on her right side around towards her torso and a little backwards towards her back. On her waistline, lower than her waistline, a little bit lower. Right where her thigh meets her torso. Like her hip kind of like a crack there. The backache she can&#39;t feel any more, she wondered if the backache was a precursor to shingles or not. Referring to the backache, maybe she didn&#39;t notice it, maybe it was on 08Mar2021 that she didn&#39;t notice the backache anymore. Patient&#39;s daughter mentioned her mom was still on 07Mar2021. On Friday 05Mar2021 at bedtime she noticed the breaking out area, and it still burns, the bumps. The rash/breaking out spot is still there and hurts. They are bumps not blisters. When she looked at it this morning 09Mar2021 after taking three of the anti-viral pills the breaking out area is not as bright, maybe a little duller red color. She uses a magnifying glass when probed for details from the Patient Vaccination Card. She has low vision in both eyes due to macular degeneration. She went to the doctor on 08Mar2021. She was prescribed antiviral, Valacyclovir 1 gram tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily. She started taking this on 08Mar2021, was prescribed 21 pills for 7 days. NDC/Lot#/Expiry unknown, discard after Mar2022. Did not see on bottle to provide. When asked about if print was small it was clarified this was a blue bottle filled by the pharmacy. It is not a manufacturer bottle. She first saw the breaking out area on Friday 05Mar2021 night and didn&#39;t think anything about it until Sunday 07Mar2021 when she had a new break out. Her second COVID-19 injection is scheduled for 19Mar2021. She did have shingles shot about 5 years ago. And she knows they have a new one, but she has not taken the new one. Her doctor told her yesterday 08Mar2021 to get the shingles vaccine. She hasn&#39;t decided if she&#39;s getting the shingles vaccine or not. The event shingles required visit to Physician office. The patient recovered from backache on 08Mar2021; recovering from shingles; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                A whole-body rash was evident 2-3 weeks after the first vaccine dose. Subject was unsure at the time if it was vaccine related. Severe swelling of hands and legs began the same day after the second vaccine dose with general malaise and concerns about fainting. Oral steroids were prescribed for 2 weeks, and progression of the symptoms seem to stabilize during steroid treatment. After steroid treatment, the symptoms resumed at full strength with swelling in the hands and legs causing the superficial skin to peel off and split down into the dermis with bleeding and pain. Joints in the hands and legs were painful. Severe swelling and pain in the hands and legs persisted for at least 6 weeks after the second vaccine dose. A diuretic was prescribed at about 4-5 weeks after the second vaccine dose. The subject is currently reporting improved symptoms.

An 81-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6205) (at the age of 81 years) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. Medical history included low back pain, overactive bladder urgency, allergies: dye in CT scan, type 2 diabetes mellitus, flu, been achy, hip replaced about 2 years ago in 2019. Concomitant medications included metformin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; atorvastatin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; glimepiride (GLIMIPRIME) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; omeprazole taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient previously took modafinil (PROVIGIL). Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 08Feb2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9264) (at the age of 81 years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, was the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that patient experienced intense pain in upper thigh, both legs, sometimes unable to walk, general muscle weakness, began 48 hrs post-2nd vaccine (also reported as occurring on 10Mar2021 22:00). Became less in 24 hrs, became intense again in another 24 hrs, and has continued ever since. Patient cannot sleep at night. Patient clarified she had it ever since 48 hours after second dose on 01Mar2021 and it&#39;s very unpleasant and does not know what to do about it and wanted to report it. These did not happen immediately and after second vaccine, patient did not have any problem till 48 hours, 10 o&#39;clock, she had it on Monday at 12:00 and at 10 o&#39;clock in the evening on Wednesday, she started to get intense pain on right side, she could barely walk and she have never had pain there before and she tried to walk and she was 81, she goes to the bathroom frequently with bladder issues and that was hard and it went on all night. In the morning, she had it not only in right leg but upper side like above the knees but in the front not in the back of the leg and then the next day, when she woke up and then, she had it in the upper side in left leg and closer to the groin and more like around and didn&#39;t know what to do and she wasn&#39;t going to go to an emergency ward as she was 81 and she doesn&#39;t go around that easily. Patient called her doctor, and patient had pain pretty much all day and he said how was it now and told him that it was slightly better. He said more than likely it will go away but he kept saying these are the kind of side effects that they were reporting though flu like achiness was nothing like what she had, she have had the flu (history) and been achy (history) but this wasn&#39;t like that. This was intense pain and it kind of changed a little bit during the day but it was still there. Her doctor said, if it doesn&#39;t go away by tomorrow morning which was Friday, then make an appointment and come in to see her, she will do blood work or whatever. So, she got an appointment for 2:30, by noon, it was just gone totally gone like if it never had been there. She cancelled the appointment then yesterday she got it back again and she could hardly walk but it wasn&#39;t as intense, it was really painful and hard for her to walk and it was around both legs and she doesn&#39;t know what to make of that, she went to rheumatologist because she thought she might be having muscle pain in arms from something else, he did some blood work (unknown results), he couldn&#39;t make anything out of it and he said he will look at the blood work and he gave her kind of a steroid cream to rub on arm (treatment) which she thought she had a problem but months ago (consumer was not sure). Now she couldn&#39;t sleep last night, it was so uncomfortable, and she had to go to the bathroom several times and again it really hurts to walk. So, that was what happened to her and she would not call that achiness of the flu at all. Regarding treatment, patient took Tylenol, do take other medications but nothing unusual and take the same that she always have and by the way the intense pain was only in one leg for twelve to twenty hours and then all of a sudden it began in the left leg as well and slightly with different pace but still on. The one in the right leg was most intense, she could barely stand. For laboratory test, the &#39;BUN&#39; test was outside of the parameters and after getting several tests he did, she wanted to see if she had some sort of rheumatoid thing and they are all in her record. This was not one of the typically adverse reactions that people reported at least according to what she read and according to aspects of it. The outcome of events pain, muscle pain in arms, and BUN abnormal was unknown while for other events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable nurse (patient). A 81-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EN6201; expiration date: 30Jun2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in deltoid left on 02Mar2021 11:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Neuropathy, Diabetes, AFib, Anemia, bleeding ulcer, Rectal bleeding, Hypertension, knee bleed, osteoarthritis in hands, Bursitis, Cataracts, arthritis in knees, Stroke, hearing impairment, Diverticulitis, Internal hemorrhoids, Bunionectomy, Fall, broke her ankle, device implant, Transfusion, retinal surgery, Cataract surgery, had a positive COVID test, Cholesterol, Weak and cracked fingernails and keep blood thin, to prevent clots. Concomitant medications included Onglyza for diabetes mellitus, Pantoprazole for ulcer. Fish oil for blood cholesterol abnormal, Atorvastatin for blood cholesterol abnormal, Zocor, Colecalciferol (VITAMIN D 3), Biotin, Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) for hypoaesthesia, ubidecarenone (COQ-10), macrogol 3350 (Miralax), acetylsalicylic acid (Baby Aspirin) for anticoagulant therapy, fexofenadine hydrochloride (Allegra). On an unspecified date, the patient experienced had sore arm and on 02Mar2021 had strong headache, stiffness/neck stiffness, chills, weakness, soreness all over the body, moderate soreness at the injection site after covid 19, joint pain, felt cold, tiny red spot at injection site about the size of a dime, back pain. The events were considered as non-serious by the reporter. Reporter stated that she was a Retired RN, and she had her first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 02Mar2021 at 11am, and she was scheduled for her second covid immunization on 23Mar2021. Caller has questions about side effects she experienced after the first dose and whether or not she should get the second immunization. Caller states she had a pretty strong reaction to the first injection. Caller states that she had the COVID disease in 22Oct2020, the caller went to the ER and had a positive COVID test because she had a fever, but she was sent home because her lungs were clear. She reported that both her son and her husband also got COVID around that time, but none of them had to be hospitalized. Stated that about an hour after her first injection, some soreness developed at the injection site. Later that afternoon she started to get a strong headache and her arm was getting sorer; in the evening, she started developing more joint pain in multiple joints, all over including, and especially, on her toes and feet; and her left arm was getting more sore, she got the chills, and she felt cold all the time, her temperature was 96.4; caller states that she also developed a tiny dime sized red spot at the injection site. Caller states that she also was thirsty, but she was a diabetic and that might have something to do with it. By the time it was time for her to go to sleep she was stiff and weak all over. She had neck stiffness, the feeling of being kind of stooped over. Caller was worried she would be unable to straighten up. The next morning, she still had weakness, stiffness and soreness, could hardly take a shower. She had to sit on side of tub and had to have her husband help her to get dressed. By about 10am the next day, everything started going away and by noon everything had pretty much cleared up completely and was gone. The pain in caller&#39;s feet and joints was gone by lunch and she did not have a fever. Caller states that at dinner that night, she was still weak though, and at the evening meal, she was so weak that she couldn&#39;t get up from the chair at the kitchen table alone. Once she was on her feet, she was okay, she could walk, but she uses a cane, especially when she was sick. About an hour or two later, she had a temperature of 99.4. But the next day, she didn&#39;t have a fever, and she could use that same chair without help. Caller states that she was fine by Friday and her blood sugar was 95, which was good. Caller states that she had a backache a few days following, but she has had backache before. Caller states that this was her history, she had the COVID, and she had a bleeding ulcer over a year ago now. Caller also saw a Cardiologist and had the watchman device implanted at the end of Sep2020, caller had this procedure to try and help get her off the Eliquis, which she had been on since having the stroke. Caller reports that she also had a Rectal bleed when she was put back on the Eliquis, and her doctors kept her on it because of the stroke. Caller states that she has silent A. Fib and that can throw little clots, so the doctors wanted her on a low dose of Eliquis but apparently that was too much for the caller too. Caller thinks the heart procedure is doing great and doing its job, but she was unable to go in for her follow up to the procedure, because she needed an esophageal echocardiogram to see if the device was sealed over by the heart muscle, and she couldn&#39;t have that until Jan2020, because she had to test negative for COVID twice. Caller states that her hemoglobin never really recovered more than 10 since her bleeding ulcer. But her hemoglobin went down to 7.4 and she was sent to the ER at the end of Jan2021, and she had two transfusions, and the next morning her hemoglobin went down to 7, the hospital staff thought that she must be bleeding. So the caller saw a GI doctor who said that the caller needed an endoscopy and colonoscopy to see where this was coming from, to make sure she was not bleeding from the ulcer. They saw the ulcer was healed but irritated, and the colonoscopy removed a couple polyps. The polyps were negative for cancer cells. After the caller had the COVID injection, she had blood in her stool. Caller went to the ER in the evening of 08Mar2021, and she stayed in the ER until the next morning. Caller states that the stool sample did show that there was some blood in her urine (captured as provided by the caller), and the ER did a CT of her abdomen, and they didn&#39;t see blood or diverticulitis. Caller does have a history of diverticulosis or internal hemorrhoids. Because things were going on last Fall, and things were rescheduled with the COVID disease, and things, the caller did not get her regular flu shot until 12Jan2021, because she needed two negative COVID tests prior to being able to get the Flu shot. She got two negative COVID tests on 24Dec2020 and 06Jan2021. Caller does not know if having had her flu shot in Jan2021, could have affected it. Caller was concerned and was wondering if she should take the second dose of the COVID vaccine or not. HCP Details: Caller hasn&#39;t spoken to her PCP since she was last in the hospital. She tried to call her HCP, but that office was getting a new computer system and they were having a high call volume for COVID stuff, so caller could not get through to them. Caller plans to email her doctor today. Everything has been overwhelming with all these things and people for doctors to juggle. Event Details: Caller reports that the soreness at her injection site, by the next morning, was up into her shoulder. Caller states that her niece, who was not a nurse, called the caller and told her to get the injection three fingers below the shoulder joint, because there were some instances of people getting injected into the shoulder joint. So, caller had soreness at the injection site, but within 24 hours, states that she was just sore all over, but it all went away by the afternoon the next day. Caller states that, she was told that she would have reactions more to the second injection than the first, so that was her concern, was she does not want to get the second injection and then it be worse than what she experienced. Caller had a lot of pain in her toes following the COVID injection, but she has diabetes that was well controlled, and she has neuropathy, and probably arthritis. But caller states that the pain in her toes was worse than normal, following receiving the COVID vaccine. Caller has had a bunionectomy, so she always has some numbness in the toe, and she fell and broke her ankle a few years later. But caller states that the very concerning thing was, following the COVID injection, the joint pain and soreness all over and weakness that she experienced. Caller had the stiffness together with some of the other things from her low hemoglobin anyway, as she has not fully recovered from the blood loss, but she was much better, and after the transfusions she had a hemoglobin of 10. And when caller went to the hospital lately, her hemoglobin was 9.4, and she was having it tested Tuesday morning again. Caller states that it was hard to say that everything she experienced was from the COVID vaccine, as she has a history of some of these things, including weakness. Caller finally got off the Eliquis when the hemoglobin went so low, she stopped the Eliquis maybe on 29Jan2021. Caller states that she was told by her Cardiologist that her symptoms at the time were from low Hemoglobin. Caller states that she was probably walking around with that low hemoglobin for a few days. Weakness: Caller states that at times she gets very fatigued, but she was not so weak right now. But caller states that weakness has been an up and down thing for her for the past few months, even before the COVID vaccine. Treatment: Caller took her normal Aspirin, but she did not take Tylenol even though she was told she could, and she did not take Allegra. She just took her normal medicines. History: When caller had her rectal bleed, she went into the ER on 08Mar2021, and she was sent home the next morning. Caller states that the ER was busy that evening and did not see the doctor until 10 or 11 that evening. But when the tests were finished up around 3am, the caller was told that she could go home or be admitted. Caller asked to go home but not until a little later in the morning, so she could call her family. Knee Bleed: Caller confirms it was aspirated and treated in the ER; she did not have to stay overnight. Caller saw orthopedic doctor a day or two later, and he did not order anything else. Caller walks with a cane now most the time because she is trying to avoid falling. Eliquis: Caller reports that the Eliquis was held for a few days after her GI bleed. She was taking 5mg twice a day from April or May2018. Caller had the GI bleed and the Eliquis was held for a few days and then she went back on it, then had rectal bleeding again. So, after that, caller&#39;s dose was reduced to 2.5mg twice day. The doctors did not want to take her off the Eliquis because of her prior stroke, so they just reduced her dose. The Eliquis had been preventing little TIAs and stuff in her hand and mouth and stuff. And that reduced dose was okay for a while. But caller states that she started getting those symptoms back, and several times a day she was getting the numbness, and she was scared she was going to have a stroke, so she said maybe because she was previously on mg twice a day, maybe she should up her dose to 7.5mg, and that worked well. So, caller took 5mg in the morning and 2.5mg in the evening. This was over a weekend, and on Monday the caller wrote her cardiologist, who said this dosing was not normally recommended, but if it was working for the caller, then that is okay. But then in July, the caller got the knee bleed. So, the doctors thought the caller&#39;s knee bleed was from the 2.5mg knee bleed but caller thinks she started to get that earlier because she had an episode that was similar before that, caller thought that episode in May or so was just arthritis. But, in Jul2020 her knee became swollen, very painful, and she could not get out of bed. Caller states that her son who was a weightlifter could not get her out of bed. She went to hospital via ambulance where her knee was aspirated. Caller reports that the Eliquis was not stopped due to the knee bleed, she was just told to go back to 2.5mg twice daily. Caller states that her heart doctor said that because she has had a stroke, she has to take the Eliquis to prevent stroke. Caller reports that she initially was not interested in the Watchman implant, but after all this, she decided to get that procedure so she could stop the Eliquis because she was a bleeder. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included colonoscopy: the ulcer was healed but irritated, endoscopy: the ulcer was healed but irritated, haemoglobin: 7.4 on Jan2021, haemoglobin: 7 on Jan2021. The outcome of sore arm and weakness was unknown, headache, stiffness/Neck stiffness, chills, soreness all over the body, moderate soreness at the injection site, Joint pain, felt cold, tiny red spot at injection site about the size of a dime were recovered on 03Mar2021 and back pain recovered on 09Mar2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of pain in arm,toe,headache,stiffness,chills,weakness,pain,joint pain,feeling cold,vaccination site erythema,pain and pain in toe.

During day some little ones mostly arms or hands, once in a while legs,  Monday 1/23 around 9:00 PM a hard jerk on left shoulder and at night kind of a hard one on left arm.   Seemed to have seattled down to mostly subtle ones in hands or arms on and off.  Legs feel kind of stiff or tight.    Once in awhile felt pulsating through out, but that seems to have gone away.  Mild pain feeling around shoulder blades on and mostly off.  Never had before.

I was beginning to get slight pain in my back by late afternoon the same day.  By bedtime, it was much worse.  I woke up around 2:am to go to the bathroom.  I couldn&#39;t even stand up.  My husband was able to help me and get me back to bed.  I had excruciating pain with every step.  I couldn&#39;t bend, turn, etc.  I spend all of the next 2 days in bed.  Yesterday, on the 3rd day, I was able to sit in a chair for a short time.  Today I am better and can get along without assistance.

She states she maybe a little tired today, but nothing else. She is fine. Her daughter had a question that she wanted the caller to ask. These symptoms do not mean she should not get the second shot?

Vaccination Facility Type: there is a special area roped off just giving shots to public. The outcome of events was recovered on 08Feb2021 and for event (tired) was unknown.

                                                Severe nausea; weight loss; stomach pain; bladder infection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient). An 82-year-old female patient not pregnant received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Mar2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose (at the age of 82-years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included tachycardia, hypothyroidism and Covid prior vaccination (date unknown). Concomitant medications in two weeks prior to the vaccination included metoprolol succinate (TOPROL), levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL). The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (BACTRIUM DS) and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  Patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 30Mar2021 patient experienced severe nausea, weight loss, stomach pain and bladder infection. Patient had three visits to primary care doctor (dr), one clinic visit for intravenous (iv) fluids, emergency room (ER) Visit and hospital admission. Patient was admitted for three days in response to the events (dates were not provided). Events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), Disability or permanent damage. The patient underwent laboratory tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test (Nasal Swab) negative on 14Apr2021 and sars-cov-2 test (Nasal Swab) negative on 16Apr2021. Patient had not recovered from the events, at the time of the report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information it is unlikely that BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) contributed to events occurrence. The reported events more likely represent intercurrent medical conditions unrelated to Covid-19 vaccination. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (at the age 82-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient states that about a week and a half to two weeks after, her left knee started to swell and reports that it is painful. She states that it is not an &#34;excruciating&#34; pain but does report that it is really bothering her and that it is stiff. She is concerned that this may be an autoimmune response to the vaccine. She also mentions that she received her second dose of the vaccine the day before yesterday. The patient states that when she took Tylenol and placed ice on it, the swelling seemed to go down a little bit and does not know if she should continue with icing it and resting it, or if she should see her doctor. Outcome of the event was not reported.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 82-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8737; Expiration Date: Jul2021, NDC number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Apr2021 (at the age of 82-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included had headaches most of her life, she knew it was her cervical spine because of bone spurs, arthritis, and bulging disc; she has also had change in vision, she was coming down the road from seeing her cardiologist and was looking down the road, out of right eye the road continued straight, but out of her left eye it looked like the road was turning off to the left, it was actually going straight, her eye doctor had told her that her eyes were no longer compatible, she was having five prisms put in her glasses, the neurologist was concerned, the eye thing started four or five months ago; she had shrunk to 4 foot 10 inches or 4 foot 11 inches, she used to be 5 foot 2 inches and shrunk because she had osteoporosis. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient reported that she had diarrhea one day in Apr2021. She started coughing some yesterday (14Apr2021). Then she was coughing more a little later. That was not what she would normally do. 14Apr2021, she was moving her winter clothes out to her summer clothes. She worked for three to four hours. Then she got so sore and was hurting all over. She felt the same this morning (15Apr2021). She was wondering if muscle aches could be a part of it. She was really hurting last night (14Apr2021) all over. She woke up this morning and felt sore. She was better now. It was from the waist up to the rib cage and all the way around. It was general, all over. She felt so badly last night (14Apr2021) and didn&#39;t feel great this morning. Another reason she was calling was because she saw her neurologist three days before and he scheduled her for an MRI of her head and brain. She had the appointment for the MRI on the 21Apr2021. She had been told that particular test was a magnet test and not radiation. She wanted to make sure there was nothing in the vaccine. They were not sure what the vaccine was going to do. They were not sure what was dealing with. Diarrhea started a couple of days before in Apr2021 when she was out of town, just for one day. It had stopped, she had recovered completely from the diarrhea. Coughing started on 14Apr2021. It was kind of a deeper cough. She had a little coughing 15Apr2021, but mainly body aches that started late 14Apr2021. She hobbled around and went to bed and got up to go to the bathroom and was having a hard time walking because she was so sore on 14Apr2021. The soreness was all over the body. She was having the MRI on her brain and head because she had been having headaches in Apr2021. She has had headaches most of her life. She had seen him (neurologist) several years before. She knew it was her cervical spine because of bone spurs, arthritis, and bulging disc. The doctor said that was the reason for a headache, but this was a different headache. It extended from behind her eye on the left side to the back of her head. It came on suddenly and she would have it for two to three days. Then that side of the head when she was turning in the left direction was sore and hurts. The headaches that felt different had been on and off for the past several months. She would have them for 3 days running and then maybe get a reprieve. She didn&#39;t want to take the second vaccine and had that on top of each other with the MRI. She wondered if she could take the second vaccine a little later. She was not comfortable getting it around the same time of the MRI. The outcome of the event diarrhea was recovered in Apr2021, sore was recovering, outcome of the other events was unknown. No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

It&#39;s more in my right arm and I cannot lift my arm when it&#39;s happening and it leaves me weak, trembling and in a cold sweat and sometimes I&#39;m real hot. In February I went to the hospital and 4 doctors looked at me, I stayed there one day overnight .  I kind of think that I was given the whole vial of the vaccine and want to know how long will it take for it to wear off, I watched them draw up the vaccine and they gave me everything in the vial. I think I got the whole vial.

She saw her Primary Care Dr on  5/10/2021 after experiencing dizziness, fatigue, confusion.  She had lost a considerable amount of weight during this time and I was concerned and accompanied her to the doctor visit.  Dr prescribed cyanocobalamin B-12 as she had been defficient in her latest blood analysis on 3/15/2021.  She also added Donepezil 5mg tablet daily and trazodone 50 mg nightly to help with sleep.  She gave referral to get Neuroligical evaluation.  My mother had a driving episode on 4/30/2021 where she was taken to Medical Center and some Scans were taken of her brain that were apparently normal they contacted me to pick her up around 2:30 AM 5/01/2021.  The number on her release folder to obtain medical Records.  My mother was residing with me my home until her appointment for evaluation .  She passed away on 6/02/2021 in my home.. Dr  was contacted to sign off on her Death Certificate .  I have not received Death Certificate as of today but I believe the cause she was putting was Natural Causes due to age.

An 82-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization (age at the time of vaccination was 82-year-old). The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure and arthritis. Concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) taken at 12.5 mg for blood pressure. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization vaccination. On an unspecified date in 2021, the patient stated after the second shot I got some side effects and a few days after it began, and it was my left hip was very sore and it got worse. The patient made an appointment with the orthopaedist but before she could get to see him, she had to go to the Hospital in the ambulance because the pain was so bad she could not move and she also had a lot of pain in my right shoulder which went on a couple of weeks, just beginning to light up a little bit that day. So, she thought it was a side effect because I thought it was exacerbated, it kicked in my immune system so that was what I was thinking it was and I just reported it. The patient stated regarding outcome as yes but it has alleviated quite a bit I mean it was very bad , quite a lot actually today anyways it&#39;s pretty good and I have been on Prednisone (treatment), I am in the middle of taking that. I started taking it (Prednisone) 10 days ago. I have another week to go on it&#39;s a reduce dose you know you take 2 a day to 5 days, when you take you take two twice a day for five days then you take one twice a day for five days and you take one a day for five days.&#34; When probed if consumer is taking any medication other than Prednisone, consumer stated, &#34;Not for the pain, I mean I do have other medications beside Prednisone. I am taking Hydrochlorothiazide (Clarified as concomitant medication) and nothing else. &#34;Regarding start date of event the patient stated, &#34;I can only give you an approximation it was about maybe four or five days later approximately. I started felling sore on my hip and then it gone worse. From 02Mar would be a good guess. She was guessing that the Pfizer shot affected her immune system and started but this is my guess, I am not a doctor. Treatment medication included Prednisone for all the events expect I thought it exacerbated, it kicked in my immune system. Outcome of all the events was reported as recovering and unknown for the event I thought it exacerbated, it kicked in my immune system.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Medical history included sulfa drug reaction, high blood pressure diagnosed in 1970s or 1980s (States she was in the hospital in the 70s or 80s. She has high blood pressure which has been difficult to control, she is seeing a cardiologist and he is content with her blood pressure readings, her diastolic is normal), incontinence, thyroid nodule surgery a year ago (2020), thyroid nodule, ten operations in the last 3 years, tightening in her neck repeatedly since her thyroid nodule surgery, scratchy throat problems since a week prior to getting the vaccine (from Jan2021) and post nasal drip and she has had that for years and when they operated nothing worked. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took cipro where she could not breathe. She does not have lot, ndc or expiration date to provide for any of the medications mentioned that she had a reaction to. She took the Asiatic flu shot in 1958 (as reported), she had a reaction and high fever, weak and pale. This occurred when she was 19 years old. She took the Pfizer covid 19 shot last Wednesday. She stated that it could be her but she got a few of the reported side effects. What she found most important was that she had swollen lips that started about an hour after receiving the vaccine. Last night (13Jan2021) she got the chills and was shaking during the night. She had mild chills in the last few days, during the night she was shaking from the chills but it may have been cold at night, reporting the chills have subsided but she can feel it a little bit. In Jan2021, she felt a burning sensation in her left arm which lasted about two minutes. She got a piercing earache in her left ear for about two minutes and then it went away. She experienced nausea within two minutes, but she ate the ginger candy she had in her purse and her nausea went away. She could have something else too since she has a red dot on the inside of her throat. She did not see it was red before last night (13Jan2021). She took Benadryl on Wednesday afternoon after she called the doctor&#39;s office, she took the Benadryl thinking it was an allergic reaction, her swollen lips seemed like it was improved but now it was minor. She has had the tightening in her neck repeatedly since her thyroid nodule surgery but she felt the tightening of her neck was more intense after receiving the vaccine, it felt like the left half of her throat was tightening, it is sort of still ongoing but states it has sort of improved. Patient also mentioned swelling on left side where the nodule was removed. She was asking if she should get the second dose. She has an appointment for her second dose. She has never had much problems till she was 80. Her husband tested negative for covid and she tested negative in Aug2020 prior to one of her surgeries. Patient stated that she is 83 but she is biologically younger. She felt pretty good normally. The events did not require emergency room visit or physician office visit.

                                                My mom received the Covid 19 vaccine on Jan 5, 2021 and became very about a week later. I was informed that she tested positive for Covid 19 on January 14th. One January 17th she became very tired and weak and would not eat. Hospice called me and told me that she was in a decline state. I saw her on January 25 and 26 and she was just sleeping and could not open her eyes. Her vitals were good and she seemed to understand when I talked to her - she would squeeze my hand and moan but she could not talk or open her eyes. My mom passed away on January 27, 2021 just 22 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She was very think to begin with and being to weak and tired  to eat resulted in her losing even more weight. Some of the other residents were given fluids to help and they recovered. My mom was not given fluids. I believe there were 20 deaths in her care home for the month of January when they vaccinated. This was an alarming number of deaths for the home. The facility had very few Covid deaths in 2019 and 2020. I asked every week if they had any Covid and or Covid deaths and this amount was shocking to me and the workers there.

An 83-year-old female consumer received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 13Jan2021 at 12:30-13:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (over the age, senior citizen). Lot number was EL8982. Medical history included diagnosed allergies, Compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity), high blood pressure, cholesterol. Concomitant medications included medicines for high blood pressure and cholesterol. Patient reported that she took suspect vaccine and for 4 days she felt fine but then in Jan2021 she developed a backache (just below the shoulder; it was really bad and very uncomfortable, on 17Jan or 18Jan, as reported), pain under arm, ache under arm pit (reportedly as worsening) and a rash from her elbow up. Patient thought after a couple days pain would be gone; it was just as bad as when it started. The patient received TYLENOL in Jan2021 and ongoing for pain, but it did not work. The patient did not visit emergency room or physician due to the events. The outcome of rash was unknown, the patient did not recover from other events.

                                                Sharp pain behind right knee.  Subsided by evening.  Went to The ER  Sunday morning, Feb. 21.  They x-rayed leg and found nothing  unusual for a woman my age.  Then they conducted a scan and discovered a blood clot behind my knee.  Since then, I have had intermittent pain. The Doctor referred me to a hematologist which I will see this week.  Prior to the vaccination have never had a blood clot.  It occurred three days after the vaccination.  Coincidence?  I think not.

At that time, she had feeling of malaise but did not check for fever.   She went to bed and fell asleep. Upon arising on Saturday, February 27, 2021, she felt feverish and had a backache.  Her fever was first checked about 11:30AM by her son and it was 101 degrees.  During the afternoon, about 3PM, she ran a higher fever (102 degrees).  The family consulted her primary care physician, who advised hydration and a Tylenol.  After talking with the physician, about 4pm,  the family gave her a 500 mg Tylenol, which brought the fever down to just under 100 degrees by 8pm Saturday night.  She also had aching legs at that time. but no longer had a backache. She slept Saturday night and awakened on Sunday, Feb 28, with a fever of 99 degrees.  Around Noon another Tylenol 500 mg tablet was administered.   During Sunday afternoon, the fever dropped to around 98.2 (Patient has a normal temperature of 97.3 or 97.4, well documented).   On Monday, March 1, 2021, at 11:00am, her temperature was normal, 97.4.  She said she still felt tired and her legs &#34;don&#39;t feel quite right&#34;.  However, our family feels she is doing much better and she has enough energy to do some of her normal activities and participate in conversation.

The patient called about the vaccine as she was having some effects. She stated she got the first shot on 08Jan2021 and, last 28Jan2021 she got the second shot. She informed she was given a &#34;paper&#34; to tell her of the effects that one might possibly have when getting the shot, and then she checked all of those. On 30Jan2021, 2 days after the shot, she was not feeling well. She stated her injection site did have a little pain on Jan2021, but it was okay, it went away the next day. She also had on Jan2021 some tiredness and muscle pain which was on there; other than that, she just has not felt good, just have felt blah. She informed that her lymph nodes were not swollen, and she has not been nauseated or have had any of these things written on the paper. She also informed having read on the paper that &#34;the people with Covid-19 and it gave the symptoms of people with COVID 19 and one of them was loss of taste, and smell was okay&#34;. She then added that after she got her first shot, she noticed once in a while she couldn&#39;t taste anything but that wasn&#39;t all the time. But now, since she got the second shot, it seemed like all day yesterday, 30Jan2021, and this morning also, that she just can&#39;t taste anything. Then she stated &#34;So, my problem is, would that be a result of the shot?&#34; She stated she was feeling a little bit better today other than that, her mouth - she can&#39;t taste anything. Also, yesterday, she took an extra strength Tylenol every 4 hours to try to help with the pain in her arm on Jan2021; but she has not taken any today. She was just trying to help her arm feel better. The outcome of the event injection site did have a little pain was recovered on Jan2021. The outcome of the event she was not feeling well/she just has not felt good, just have felt blah was recovering. The outcome of the event just can&#39;t taste anything was not recovered. While the outcome of all other remaining events was unknown.

Timing of these episodes are random, but seem to occur when she first gets up in the morning or after she takes a shower or has been active.  They lasts between 3 and 7 minutes and then completely resolve.  She has never had any similar symptoms.  She reports that these episodes occur between 4-6 times during the course of 24 hours.

An 83 years old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 at age of 83 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hip surgery a few months ago and she was still kind of stiff and sore. Concomitant medications included lisinopril at low dose 10 mg once daily taken for blood pressure abnormal about 10 years ago; clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) taken for transient ischaemic attack from 2012 (she believed it was a around that time); acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN LOW) at low dose (she began taking this before the Lisinopril so it has been several years).The patient mentioned that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021 and everything was fine that day and the day after. At late in the day on 04Mar2021, she experienced a lot of problems which she mentioned was the worst experience in her life. She was 99% sure it was from the vaccine because she didn&#39;t experience anything like that before getting the vaccine. She mentioned that she experienced side effects all night like her heart beating really fast, a headache, a stiff neck, her nerves pounding all throughout her body, and a blood pressure of 174/78. She mentioned that it was the worst she&#39;s felt so far as compared to going to the ER, as she&#39;s experienced before. She did not go to the ER as she could not drive herself and she was living alone. She mentioned that she better the next day although it was not totally gone, she was a little shake and kind of weak. As of calling, she said that she was feeling okay and better than yesterday (07Mar2021) in which the effects were still present. She mentioned that it was horrible, very scary, she was very ill, very uncomfortable, really bad, and didn&#39;t want to go through that again. She didn&#39;t know if she would make it through the night. She was asking for what to do and asking if there needed to be an adjustment for her dose because she was a very small person. She didn&#39;t want to have the 2nd shot if she went through that again. It was the worst experience of her life. She was not sure what to do now about her second shot. She had the first shot 02Mar2021 and everything was fine, 03Mar2021 she was okay but on 04Mar2021 she had, by night time, she had a lot of scary things that had never happened to her before. Her heart was pounding she could hear it in her ears. Her head, her neck felt stiff and her head felt heavy, her whole body felt heavy and like the nerves in her whole body were just aggravated, it was hard to explain. She had ringing in her ears. Her blood pressure was 174/78 and she was just afraid to have the second shot, it was scary, it was really bad. She was wondering if the amount of the vaccine was too much for her.  She confirmed it was the evening 04Mar2021 when all this began. She said all of this was pretty well recovered at this point. She said the day after that happened, she was shaky but today (08Mar2021) she was fine. She did not know what it would be medications they are looking for but she was on normal medicine for old people she guesses. This was so bad that she really was not going to take the second dose unless they can tell her if she should or that they should give her less or something like that. The outcome of events was recovered in Mar2021.

An 83-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot umber ad expiration date were not reported) as a single dose, with route of administration and therapy date unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine. The patient previously took morphine, and had allergies; and the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number and expiration date were not reported) on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization, and had polymyalgia rheumatica, RS3PE, elevated ESR and elevated CRP. On an unspecified date in 2021, after the second dose of vaccination, the patient&#39;s developed symptoms consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica and RS3PE including elevated ESR and CRP have significantly worsened. The reported events have resulted into doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was hospitalized on an unspecified date in 2021 for two days due to the reported events. The patient had received methylprednisolone (MEDROL) and prednisone as treatment for the reported events. The outcome of the events, &#39;developed symptoms consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica and RS3PE including elevated ESR and CRP have significantly worsened&#39;, was recovering. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination; and had a nasal swab test in Mar2021 that was negative post-vaccination.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible temporal association, a causal association between the reported &#39;polymyalgia rheumatica and RS3PE including elevated ESR and CRP &#39; (aggravated, already reported after the first dose of vaccine) and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A few days prior to second shot i developed irritation on 2 days of left foot.  Following second shot, I had sore arm for a day and a half, joint pain at left hip that extended all the way down my leg which caused difficulty walking.  That pain lasted for 2 full days.  The toe irritation developed into painful blisters and extended to 3 toes on my left foot.  I am currently using Hydro cortisone cream on them.

A visit to a Now Care facility on that Sunday morning confirmed a diagnosis of shingles, and Valacyclovir was prescribed, 1 gm. tablet every 8 hours for 7 days.  In the following 4 days, as the medication was taken, the rash gradually spread around the side of the thorax from front to back and under the left arm.  The pain remains as of 4/22/21.

An 83-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 28Mar2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported: did not get a card that lists NDC, Lot, Expiration) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. It was also reported that no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. The patient did not require visit to Emergency Room and stated that she was desperate and would&#39;ve gone but she didn&#39;t have a ride and added she is worried about the second. Also, the patient did not required visit to the physician&#39;s office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine and 5 days later she got a terrible reaction. She did not expect it. She had a terrible reaction and thought she was going to die. She stated she wanted to report this because the TV says you should expect some kind of reaction after the second dose but does not say after the first and she said that Pfizer needs to know about this reaction. She stated she heard the second dose is worse. The patient asked if she has to get her second dose and if she needs to report this anywhere else? The patient added &#34;what should I do about side effects?&#34; It was reported that the patient (reported as is almost 84) had the first shot on Sunday 28MAR2021 and everything was fine by Friday she was in terrible trouble really really bad. States she has never heard of this, they say the first is easy and everything was terrible. States every bone and every part of her body hurt on 02Apr2021. She states after 24 hours (03Apr2021) it did go away. The patient asks does this happen to other people? It was stated that her symptoms came on suddenly and she had a severe sore throat, stiff neck, back ache, pain under her ribs, very very weak and shaky, shortness of breath, biceps ached, fatigue, and a tremendous headache. It was stated that started on Friday 02Apr2021 12:00 like a hurricane and after 24 hours they subsided on Saturday 03Apr2021. The patient added that she doesn&#39;t remember getting a card and didn&#39;t know that she should have a card until she saw something about it on TV, and thought well she didn&#39;t get a card. The patient also asked what does she do about that?  The patient states she takes medication but not that affects this. The outcome of the events recovered on 03Apr2021.

                                                Six days after the second dose of Pfizer I started experiencing shortness of breath so I went to the ER and took a chest x-ray and had fluid in my lungs. Doctors discovered I had Atrial Fibrillation. In January I had an Echo Cardiogram and none of the previous described diagnoses were present then. I was admitted; doctors attempted to shock my heart back into rhythm several times but were unsuccessful. Therefore, I was put on Eliquis (5mg) and a water pill to get rid of the fluid in my lungs (and swollen ankles). I was hospitalized for 9 days where I was evaluated through numerous tests. Eventually it was suggested that I undergo the Watchman&#39;s Procedure to get off blood thinners. Everything went well with that surgery on Thursday May 20th; complications arose after the surgery: heart rate and blood pressure spike, lungs started filling up with fluid. Ended up in ICU for four days. I still have a problem with my lungs despite having no history of lung problems and I am now dealing with AFIB. This all started 6 days after my second shot.

                                                left arm was blue from her shoulder to her elbow almost whole circumference going under arm /left arm discoloration is what she calls &#34;puce&#34;, clarifying hers is a purple, black, and blue color; slight left arm swelling; left arm discomfort; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). An 84-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiration date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 12Jan2021 14:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On Jan2021, her left arm was blue from her shoulder to her elbow and almost the whole circumference going under her arm. On Jan2021, she has a slight left arm swelling and left arm discomfort. The discomfort was bearable. The discoloration of her left arm has become bad. She was at the COVID-19 vaccine clinic, some nurses looked at her arm, and insisted she contact Pfizer and her doctor to report what happened to her arm. She has an appointment with her doctor the afternoon of 20Jan2021. Her second COVID-19 vaccine dose is scheduled on 02Feb2021. Her left arm swelling and discomfort is the same now, but her left arm discoloration is awful. Her left arm discoloration is the only change she has experienced since her first report. Her left arm discoloration is what she calls &#34;puce&#34;, clarifying hers is a purple, black, and blue color. The discoloration of her left arm is uncanny. The discoloration stops before her left elbow like a completely straight line drawn by a ruler. The discoloration continues from her left elbow up to her left shoulder for which the discoloration spreads out unevenly. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported events based on the known safety profile and temporal association   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

Patient was treated for severe sepsis and acute kidney injury.  Patient was given fluid resuscitation, but unresponsive to treatment; NE&#43; vasopressin, hydrocortisone IV, along with empiric antibiotic regimen were initiated. Patient later on developed pulmonary edema, Non-ST elevation MI with no chest pain and new onset of cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45% and clean coronary arteries shown on cardiac catheterization. Physician suspected cytokine release syndrome related to the COVID vaccine and congestive heart failure. Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.  MD indicated vaccine reaction unlikely.

The second shot had a little stronger symptoms. I had covid in early November, 2020 in case that matters.    Also, I had a flu shot late October and had a severe reaction which led to my being diagnosed with covid.

Patient approximately 1 week ago was bending over to pick something up and fell to the floor landing on her coccyx, and has had increased low back pain since that time.  Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.  Patient also had a urinalysis performed which shows negative for leukocytes, nitrate negative.  Patient was admitted to medical inpatient as it is deemed that she will need longer than a 2 midnight stay for cardiac monitoring and will work with physical therapy and occupational therapy for gait training and strengthening with relation to the compression fracture of her L2 fracture, and pain control.

The vaccination was given in the morning at 9:20 AM and she did not have any symptoms until 6:00 PM that evening. Her arm started to ache like hell. That one showed up then, but cleared up in a couple of days. The arm got better and better. The other set of side effects started yesterday which was tiredness, muscle pain, nausea, and feeling horribly ill. She felt awful and did not want to go to a hospital if it was not necessary. HCP information included she had only seen him a couple of times. She had a long term doctor that retired and she got shifted over to him. They did not have a good relationship she must say. His whole group was associated with where she got the vaccine. They were all virtual now. She had been on lock down for a year. She did not have the doctor&#39;s address, phone number, or email. Tiredness, muscle pain, nausea, and feeling horribly ill: started yesterday morning when she got up between 4:30 AM and 5:00 AM. She was so woozy and thought it was left over sleep. She felt unwell all day. She had felt unwell today, but not as bad as yesterday. She had to get vaccination card out of hand bag and needs her glasses to read the small numbers. First dose was given on 04Feb2021. She had appointment on 25Feb2021 for second dose. Healthcare Provider who gave the vaccine was Hospital. They called her on the third at 5:00 PM to see if she could come the next day for the vaccine. They did a good job. Her brother was a retired anesthesiology and she called him this morning and he said to go to the hospital or testing center. Then he agreed that she should call Pfizer. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect and additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect were none. She did not get her flu shot in anticipation of getting the COVID vaccine. Her brother and his granddaughter were both anesthesiologist. They get work up about not being able to breathe and ventilators. They gave advice. She was glad her brother approved for her to call Pfizer to find out. She wanted to believe it was side effects. She had been on lock down. Her brother said she could have been exposed at the vaccine site. Caller stated everyone had on a mask. She was not obese. She was not sure if it is relevant, but she would tell it anyway. She fractured her skull 5 years ago and was in Hospital because it was bleeding. That had resolved. She was in ICU and then six weeks of acute rehab. She had a bad case of shingles two years ago which led to bleeding ulcers. Again she went to the hospital, but she was scoped they found ulcers and treated. She went back for scope again and it had all healed up&#34;. Outcome of the event have achy arm was recovering whereas other events was unknown.

The patient states she was unable to pick up her right leg and put it over her left leg. She states she is not getting better. The patient is asking if this is a side effect of the Covid vaccine, or is it from something else? She states she was healthy, she walked and was active, before the vaccine.

I went to the doctor and had whole panel of test and they ruled everything out  I don&#39;t have Lyme, they took me of  my cholesterol medication, I bought a new mattress, I am not sleeping in new mattress. I only take one medication cholesterol medication which I stopped and I am in agony and I wanted to know, if this is possibly connected to the COVID vaccine because I was really really healthy individual before they started.&#34; There is no additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect, no prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks), no AE following prior vaccinations, no patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination).

The patient didn&#39;t know if that&#39;s related to the injection. It was not her right knee also, it was only her left knee and it looked like it&#39;s inflamed a little bit in the areas to the interior of my knee toward her upper leg. It was very painful to stand on or walk on. The patient did not have any pain at the injection site. She did not have any fever that she was aware of, she had no nausea, she was not dizzy.

                                                left arm swelling, appeared within one hour of second vaccine dose. Swelling progressed with soreness of arm. Swelling worse day after. Started abating by Thursday 2/25/21 evening. Advised ice pack on arm, but pt. said it was too sore on day after dose given (Wednesday) to apply. Pt. took one aspirin on Wednesday morning. Advised her she could take a second later in the day. (Yesterday pt. stated she had taken a Tylenol. Today upon review she realized that she took an aspirin. Ibuprofen is also available. Advised pt. take an ibuprofen now over the phone as I waited. Taken at 8:13pm EST. No further medication taken on Wednesday. (Also encouraged ice pack on neck Wednesday for ongoing strong headache / neck pain yesterday. Pt. does not remember if she tried that. Head/neck pain resolved today.) Pt. states swelling today (Thursday) is mild-to-moderate, less than yesterday, but still noticeable. Doesn&#39;t hurt as much as it did yesterday, she says. She can now lift her arm without pain.

An 85-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021, 11:00 am as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension, stroke, heart attack, COVID-19 in Aug2020 (actually had COVID this summer in August, had the mild case), and emergency surgery in Aug2020. Concomitant medications included ajmaline (CARDIA), isosorbide, and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for cardiac disorder; and losartan. The patient her first dose on 04Feb2021 and experienced headaches, muscle aches and pains, chills, other flu-like symptoms, heart conditions, and sensitivity to eggs. She mentioned that this was normal and nothing unusual. She received her second dose on 25Feb2021 at 11:00 am. She was still kind of stiff but was okay. The next day on 26Feb2021 at 11:00 am, she noticed bright red bleeding in her urine when she emptied her bladder. After a few hours it faded. On the next day on 27Feb2021, she experienced the bright red bleeding in the urine again. The red blood did not hurt and patient was achy and headachy, &#34;you know muscles.&#34; So, that kind of happened and it just kind of eased off. She slept a lot because she felt tired and so rotten from Friday, Saturday, Sunday after getting the shot. She also had a mild low-grade fever, headaches, and body aches and pains which she considered normal. Patient was hard of hearing and did not have a bright red bleeding, just had a taint little bit till the day when she got it and then the next day, she went to the bathroom to empty her bladder again and had bright red bleeding again with some blood clots in it. Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry. She have never had that experience before so she was just not sure was that connected with that shot? She wanted to know if there were any other patients that have had that. Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs. Her urine seems to be clear as of the time of report. She wants to know if the bright red bleeding in the urine has been reported. Patient stated, &#34;I used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but now I am 5&#39;4&#34;. I think I am weighing about 158 now. I am sorry like I said because of my hearing and with a language difference a little bit. I was having a trouble hearing you.&#34; The patient did not have treatment for the events.

No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patients medical history includes ongoing Arthritis for approximately 3-5 years (saying the arthritis has come on gradually) and Total Right Knee Replacement about 14 months ago. The patients concomitant medication included Zinc Chewable from Jan2021 and ongoing as Supplementation therapy and acetaminophen/paracetamol (Tylenol 8 Hour, 650mg, Extended-Release Tablets, UPC Number was not listed on the Tylenol Arthritis product bottle, Lot Number: FMA062, UPC Number was not listed on the Tylenol Arthritis product bottle, Expiration Date: Aug2023) at 650 mg (one tablet) dose on 04Feb2021 for arthritis/arthritis pain prior to receiving both doses of COVID-19 Vaccine..

She did not realize Pfizer recommends not to take Tylenol before the COVID-19 Vaccine shot then she read through the COVID-19 Vaccine information that was given to her and saw Pfizer recommends not to take Tylenol. She was worried because she took the Tylenol Arthritis before her COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Her friends daughter who is a nurse told her to take a Tylenol before she took the COVID-19 Vaccine shot. That is why she took the Tylenol and asked if taking Tylenol will affect the COVID-19 Vaccine. Also, her height is about 5&#39;7&#34;, she used to be 5&#39;8&#34;, but her arthritis has taken her down to 5&#39;7&#34;. She did not feel anything after taking her first dose. She said she had no reaction to the second COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she may have slept on her neck wrong, but her neck and left arm discomfort are not bad at all.

She had a follow-up appointment with her GP on April 27 and was  diagnosed with shingles.  She continued to get more uncomfortable and confused, and late on April 29,  a neighbor took her to the other local hospital where she was admitted.  A lumbar puncture test confirmed that she had herpes zoster virus in the spinal fluid.  She was treated in the hospital with acyclovir by IV and was released from the hospital on May 4 to a skilled nursing facility where she rehabilitated until May 14, when she was sent home.

An 86-year-old female patient (mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 12Jan2021 10:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for years; COVID-19 Virus from 23Apr2020 to an unknown date, patient was not on a vent or in the ICU but did receive plasma as part of her COVID-19 Virus treatment; ongoing cough. Caller&#39;s grandmother had Multiple Sclerosis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and had significant side effects. Patient weight was 175 lbs as provided by caller, who stated her mother recently moved into an independent living facility, and gained weight because the facility has a really good pastry chef. Patient height, reported her mother shrunk, and was 5&#39;5-1/2&#34;. Reported her mother couldn&#39;t walk after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was not able to walk the next morning, 13Jan2021. The caller stated she had to spend 3 days with her mother, after her mother received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021. Reported she thought initially what her mother was experiencing was either neurological or muscular. She said it was like her mother&#39;s brain wanted her to move, but her mother&#39;s legs wouldn&#39;t move. She said her mother needed to use a walker and have someone hold her from behind. She said now, at a week later, her mother still was not back to normal. She clarified her mother needed a walker to maneuver around, but didn&#39;t need someone holding her from behind. Reported she assumed her mother may have had tiredness, weakness, severe muscle weakness from receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She clarified if her mother wasn&#39;t able to walk after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, then what her mother had was the epitome of weakness, and the weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body. She said her mother had tremendous fatigue on days 2, 3, and 4 after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was able to function as of 19Jan2021, but her mother couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open during that time period. Reported her mother developed a congestive cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not continual, but persisting. She stated her mother said the cough was there before she had her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. The caller stated she disagreed with her mother. She said her mother has COPD, but her mother was not a cougher. She said her mother&#39;s cough now, reminded her of the cough her mother had when her mother had the COVID-19 Virus in 2020. She clarified her mother was tested on 23Apr2020 for the COVID-19 Virus, and diagnosed positive for the virus on 24Apr2020. The caller said she was perplexed by her mother&#39;s cough, and her mother will be seeing her doctor this Thursday, 21Jan2021. She said she gave her mother some Robitussin for the cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not persistent, but the cough was still there. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not constant, but her mother&#39;s cough was congested. She said she didn&#39;t know when her mother&#39;s cough started. She said she thought giving her mother the Robitussin doses was kind of insignificant, because her mother did not have a constant cough, where she needed to take the Robitussin. She said her mother didn&#39;t even use half of a normal sized Robitussin bottle. Caller stated she did not have the Robitussin UPC, Lot, and Expiration Date. Reported her mother has an annual lung x-ray and MRI, clarifying she believed her mother had both within the past 3 months. Reported her mother was concerned about receiving the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she told her mother that it was better to get the second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine than to get the COVID-19 Virus again. Reported her mother had asked her primary care doctor if she should get the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her doctor told her absolutely. She said her doctor told her she needed to take the COVID-19 Vaccine even if she had the plasma treatment with the COVID-19 Virus in Apr2020. Reported she planned to stay with her mother after her mother received the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t anticipate her mother having a reaction after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose because people said most reactions are happening after getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said now people are reporting having reactions after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported she thought her mother&#39;s side effect after having the COVID-19 Vaccine to be unusual, since most people say it feels like they have the flu, or they are tired, or they have a headache. Reported her mother not to be able to walk wasn&#39;t that her mother was not walking, but that her mother&#39;s foot wouldn&#39;t move. She said mother not walking was either neurologic or muscular, unless that is what extreme weakness is. She said she wondered if others have experienced what her mother has. She said if her mother was experiencing just extreme weakness, the extreme weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body, not in her upper body. She said her mother didn&#39;t have an appetite, but her mother was not too weak to put a spoon to her mouth. She said her mother couldn&#39;t move her legs, and her mother said her legs felt stiff, or almost frozen. She said if her mother had extreme weakness, and couldn&#39;t walk, what did that mean. She said if a person is really tired, the person can still move and get out of bed. She said her mother said she was really, really tired, and couldn&#39;t move. The caller said her mother said she couldn&#39;t move, and it took her mother 20 minutes to get her legs over the side of the bed. She said her mother not being able to move her legs could be extreme weakness, but observing her mother first hand, she said it looked like her mother not being able to move her legs was neurologic. She said her mother was strong in character and body, and her mother would do everything she could in her body to move, but it was like her mother&#39;s brain said &#34;go&#34;, and her body said &#34;not now&#34;. The outcome of the event Congestive cough was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient explained she got the vaccine 5 days ago (from the time of report) and reported she had muscle tightness around her whole face, she had a slight droop on the left lip, a slight headache right across the eye brows, her legs feel a little numb off and on, she got feeling of tiredness but that passes, she had the need to go eat suddenly or she will get very weak. The reason for the call was she was wondering if she should she go for the second vaccine when 5 days after having the vaccine she was experiencing numbness. Slight droop on the left lip started but never looked close until the time of report, not a lot but the lower lip on the left side it is slightly droopy, with slight headache right across the eye brows. Her legs felt a little numb off and on, and she stated that about 3 days after the vaccine, she was afraid to take a shower because her legs weren&#39;t steady enough. They are still that way at the time of report, but this did go away for a while on a day and she was able to take a shower. She also didn&#39;t feel well after the vaccine. On the day of the vaccine, she had a good dinner and felt good; but the next morning she was very weak and could only stay awake for very short amounts of time. She was in bed and couldn&#39;t stay up and this is not like her, she did not like to be in the bed. She got the feeling of tiredness but that passes and she can stay up for longer periods of time. She had to go eat or she gets very weak, she didn&#39;t feel like eating in the beginning. It was on the 4th day after the vaccine she would have to get a bowl of cereal all of a sudden or she would feel like she was going to pass out. She never had trouble with her stomach like this before where she felt the need to have to go and eat. She explained she never had trouble with stomach, she never had headaches, and never had a vaccine before. Muscle tightness around her whole face started 2 days after getting the vaccine and was getting worse. Her face felt really tight almost numb feeling. The outcome of the events was unknown.

We placed her in a wheelchair and she then said that her throat was closing up.  She said that it felt like someone was choking her.  A moment later, she felt like her jaws felt huge.  We quickly gave her about four or five large glasses of water  (one right after the other) and quickly took her blood pressure which went up to 170/80.  We then gave her one of her blood pressure pills.  After this, she started to finally feel better.

                                                Same day as when patient received the 2nd vaccine, she was overcome with generalized fatigue and nausea.  By the 4th day, her legs would not hold her when she tried to stand getting out of bed.  She was nauseous to the point of not being able to eat or drink.  Infact, she did not have the strength or desire to eat or drink.  By the 5th day post vaccine (02/20/21), I took her to the Emergency room because she was so fatigued, she just slept, and couldn&#39;t stay awake to eat or drink.  She was able to get to the car with a walker, but that was the last time she walked.  After time at hospital and then Skilled nursing, she passed away on 03/21/21.  She never regained the ability to toilet herself, eat on her own, failed to eat and drink, and eventually was put on hospice because she lost 30 pounds over the month from failure to eat or drink, even though I was there or the nurse was there to feed her every meal, and try to get her to take fluids.  Her fatigue was just overwhelming. When she first arrived at the emergency room, she: ? Presented with 2 days of weakness and AMS; fever, nausea  and generalized fatigue ? Word finding difficulty; without stroke or acute abnormal on CT or MRI; according to the Hospital

                                                The day after the first shot, my mother had bad knee pain in her left knee. It went on for days/week. After the second dose, days out she started feel very tired and bad pain in her feet that went to her hands and she couldn&#39;t get out of bed or urinate properly. Her facility doctor gave her Gabepentin for the pain but it did not help. She declined over a week or so and then She was admitted into the hospital for dehydration (March 19, 2021). The put a catheter in her to get urine out and bring her kidney function back to her normal (she does have kidney disease). Gave her more Gabepentin (which does not help pain in feet an hands) and released her to rehab. and she is now on oxygen.  Rehab was bad so I got her out and released to her facility so she could receive rehab there. She declined again with the same reaction: extreme fatigue, can&#39;t walk and now urinates and defecates in an adult diaper and now breathing is very labored.  She was admitted to the hospital and they can&#39;t find out why she is in this way. They did blood work, tests, scan and X-rays without any answers. They switched up meds on her and then released her to rehab since she hasn&#39;t walked in weeks/month at this point. She is regaining strength but now on oxygen even when sitting. She is 86 and walked with a walker all around her facility and when going to doctor appointments. Now she is in a wheelchair for doctor appointments since she has no strength and needs oxygen to walk. Her facility saw her decline after the second shot and my mom is very vocal and each day told them how she felt awful and it is because of the shot. She still has neuropathy in her feet and hands but it is not as painful as it originally was and it peaked and now just painful about a 5-6 on a scale of 0-10.

But last pill yesterday, so must  see if pain returns.  Problem has continued from March 12 to today.   Pain was extreme: very difficult to walk stairs, get out of bed, etc.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 86-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EW0191) on 29May2021 (at age of 86-year-old) on left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Asthma, ongoing degenerative osteoarthritis, ongoing Stent, COVID-19 from 15Jan2021, diarrhea. Concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL) 500 mg tablet for pain. The patient previously took Plavix from unspecified date and ongoing. Caller states she is calling about the immunization, says she got it last Saturday in the afternoon (39May2021). She felt alright on Saturday, but from Sunday (30May2021) on, she began to have problems. Caller states she has advanced, degenerative osteoarthritis, and says it has been storming in Indiana this week. Caller states she has been in terrible pain, says she usually doesn&#39;t complain, and has been living with pain for years. Caller says she has to be pretty bad to complain. Sunday was really miserable with the arthritis. Caller says she is telling Pfizer not because she expects Pfizer to do anything with it, but says maybe she can help someone else who calls in because obviously she survived and the pain has gotten better through the week. Caller says Monday was another bad day, and she finally just had to give up and leave everything where it was and just go in the bed because she was hurting so bad. She clarifies she had to give up, says she tried to stay up but had to go back to bed because of the pain. Caller states her symptoms were an elevated temperature, which was a low grade one and still has it today, and she had GI symptoms. Caller states she and her grandson were running parallel, says they were both exposed at the same time, and both came down at the same day, and their symptoms were the same except her grandson does not have arthritis. Caller states they had a low grade temp, GI problems where they were not exactly nauseated, but it was kind of like a hunt. Some things went in their stomach and her stomach felt a little better with food in it, and then the problem was the diarrhea. Her and her grandson both had diarrhea and both slept quite a lot. Caller states she slept the clock around a couple of days. Caller stated both her and her grandson were hazy, mentally. The caller states she was surprised because her grandson is a very sharp young man, and he was sort of numb. When attempting to verify the details above and if her grandson also received the vaccine at the same time she did, the caller clarifies she is confusing things. She was talking about when they both had the COVID virus about the 15Jan. Caller says they were both exposed and came down with it the same day, says they ran parallel for 3-4 weeks. Caller confirms she is the only calling about herself today having received the vaccine. Caller states she is about 140 lbs, says she hasn&#39;t been very active lately. Caller states she received her vaccine at noon, says she was supposed to be there at 11, got lost getting there, waited in line, and then was ready at noon. Caller states they made her wait awhile longer because of her reactions to medications, says she waited a half of an hour. Caller states because felt it was wise for her to take the COVID-19 vaccine in lieu of her medical history with asthma, a stent, things like that. Caller says the doctors said it was wise for her to take it even though she had had the virus. She trusts , and has been with the doctor for 30 years, says she started with him when he first started his practice, says she trusts him, he&#39;s excellent, so when he said she should take it, she said ok. Caller states she didn&#39;t want to. Causality: Caller states she is inclined to think pain is related to the vaccine, but she is not going to say positively it was related, but it certainly is a coincidence. Caller states what she felt was that whatever was in the vaccine sort of irritated the irritation in her back and hips and leg and everything. Caller says they had some stormy weather this week and that always makes arthritis worse, but something caused the low grade fever. Caller states she is kind of assuming it&#39;s the COVID-19 vaccine. To be honest, she is kind of scared of the second dose so that&#39;s why she changed her appointment until the day after Father&#39;s day. Father&#39;s day will be the first time to see her entire family since the virus. Caller says her second dose was scheduled for the day before Father&#39;s day, but after the week she has had, she&#39;s going to get the immunization afterwards so she gets to see everybody. Caller then states she does feel the low-grade fever, and pain she was feeling, and the GI upset, were related to the vaccine. The GI upset was kind of a milder version of what she had when she had the virus. Caller states both she and her grandson had the GI upset when they had the virus. Caller says he wouldn&#39;t eat for awhile, but she got him to eat what she was eating because she figured out what her stomach would tolerate. Her and her grandson both had diarrhea and that was the bothersome part of it. After the vaccine, the caller did a lot of sleeping, says sleeping didn&#39;t last as long with the vaccine as it did with the virus. Caller says it was just a feeling of tiredness and she felt kind of blah. She really felt kind of stupid, it was hard to think- she doesn&#39;t know whether it was because she slept so much or what.  Caller states she does not take strong pain medications for her arthritis because she has a stent and is on Plavix 24/7. She was told two years ago there is an incidence of internal bleeding for people who take arthritis medication and those who have a stent and are on a blood thinner 24/7. Caller states she was given the option of either taking a chance or not to take the pain medication. Caller says she didn&#39;t take the chance and opted not to take the pain medication. Caller says she only takes Tylenol extra strength, she does not use anything else. Caller says it can&#39;t be a pain medication that made her sleepy and stuff. Terrible pain: Caller states that one day, she just gave up and went to bed because she hurt so bad. She is not sure she would say the pain is disabling. The pain began on Sunday. She was a mess when she woke up. She clarifies she might have been up through the night to go to the bathroom and was miserable. Sunday was miserable, and Monday was a miserable day. Elevated temperature: Caller states fever began in the night, says she can&#39;t remember whether it was Sunday night or during the day on Sunday, says she&#39;s not exactly sure when. When probed for the seriousness, she said the significance might be due to the immunization. She confirms the fever is getting better, she felt better yesterday. Caller says today her eyes are burning. She took her temperature earlier and it was up, and her temperature is still up. Caller states because she takes Tylenol morning and evening, before she goes to bed, says it helps the pain somewhat. Caller says the first part of the week, Monday and Tuesday, the Tylenol might have taken the edge off. Extra Strength Tylenol: 500 tablets per bottle, 500 mg per tablet. Caller states the NDC:3014256190. Caller says she doesn&#39;t see a lot number, but there is a number underneath the expiration date: 9EE2582B.Exp: Feb 2021. Caller states the pain today is about the same that it always is, says she&#39;s pretty much in pain all the time, says it&#39;s something she has to live with. Caller states about the only time she is pain free is when she&#39;s in bed and has relaxed and taken a dose of Tylenol and it has taken effect. Caller states after she gets up in the morning and starts moving around, she starts having pain. Sometimes she has pain early in the morning, depends on what she does, like run the sweeper or when she&#39;s getting groceries. Caller states getting her groceries are one of the worst things, and she will have more pain the next morning. GI upset symptoms: Caller says she&#39;s pretty sure it started Sunday or just right away after that. Caller says it&#39;s a strange feeling, it&#39;s kind of a queasy, hungry feeling, it&#39;s a weird feeling. Caller says she puts a little food down there and it helps. Caller says she&#39;s been eating a lot of crackers, wheat thins, and ginger snaps. Caller says she has eaten and is pretty comfortable, says she would say it&#39;s getting better. Caller states she thinks in general, she is getting better- it&#39;s not perfect, but she is getting better. Caller states the reason she called is, for instance, her daughter in law, the mother of her grandson, was tending to think his symptoms from the virus were psychological and so forth. Her daughter in law is sort of that way, and she thinks everybody&#39;s else pain is psychological but hers. Caller states she came to her grandson&#39;s defense and fixed him up three care packages over a month with food that her stomach would tolerate- like crackers, ginger snaps, powdered chicken noodle soup, not canned, and oddly enough canned green beans, just plain old green beans, nothing on them- she didn&#39;t even have to warm them. Caller says her stomach tolerated them. Also, baked beans helped, she needed protein in there, says she tolerated baked beans and so did her grandson. Caller can&#39;t say everything she put in the care package, but tea was one thing, and another thing was cocoa. Caller says she got a generic mix. She mentions she tried some others, but they were not that good which was also because her taste doesn&#39;t enjoy food. Caller states this cocoa was good and was the generic brand. She gave her grandson a couple of cans of that because she drank that every evening when she took her medicine and ate crackers with her medicine before bed, and it was kind of soothing to her stomach. She knows it sounds weird, but it worked. Her GI upset she would consider medically significant because there was definitely a tie up. She explains it wasn&#39;t disabling and she doesn&#39;t consider it serious. She explains it was annoying, especially when she had the diarrhea. Unable to determine if caller was referring to vaccine symptoms or virus symptoms. Tiredness: She states she would consider the tiredness medically significant because she would sit down and she would get sleepy and then she did all this sleeping. Caller states it wasn&#39;t serious. She states the whole thing about this virus is kind of annoying because it was just bad enough it kept her from functioning normally and kept her feeling kind of lousy. Caller states she is feeling better, says it&#39;s improving. Hard to think: Caller states she would also consider this medically significant. She wouldn&#39;t have driven, says she wasn&#39;t sharp enough to drive or do anything important. Caller states today she is a little tired, but her temperature is up- it all goes in together. Attempted to clarify symptoms of the vaccine with caller. Caller states one thing she wants to tell Pfizer about her grandson is about the mental fog. The caller and her son were very afraid her grandson had that because her grandson was just a blob sitting there. He has been depressed because his parents are in a custody battle, so she doesn&#39;t know what part that played in it. Caller says she was concerned about him. He is 15 and he is very intelligent, but his grades went to Ds and Fs. Caller says her son got ahold of the high school counselor and the mother wouldn&#39;t do anything about it. The high school counselor got in on it, her son got on it, then they got someone got on it. Caller says they got her grandson through the work he was behind on, says he was behind for the whole thing. His mother didn&#39;t encourage him to do any school work. Maybe it wouldn&#39;t have done any good, maybe he was too far gone to do any work. Caller says they were concerned about the mental fog. She says her grandson is coming out of that and becoming his old self again. Caller says he is very intelligent and inquisitive, and he was just a blob for a long time. Medications: Caller stated she has been taking Plavix since 2008. She clarifies she started taking the Plavix because of her stent. She was on brand Plavix for a while and at one point she was switched to generic and she is on the generic 24/7. Tried to confirm with caller the generic name, but the call disconnected. Outbound call,was placed on 04Jun2021 at 3:24pm and was unsuccessful. Placed second outbound call, on 04Jun2021 at 3:25pm and was unsuccessful. The outcome of the events was unknown. The causality was reported as related. The seriousness was reported as medically significant.

A 86-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL9266; Expiration Date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 18Feb2021 as 2nd dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL9265, Expiry: 20May2021), dose injection to right arm, not too high up on the shoulder. The patient experienced calling to report pain, weakness to right arm, twisted her knee a little bit/folding chair came down and slammed down onto her knee, deep bruise, she hasn&#39;t gotten the vaccine for shingles, could only remember the itchy thing, problem with her knee on left side on an unspecified date, second dose hurt when it went in on 18Feb2021, arm had also sort of lost the strength in it too on an unspecified date in Mar2021, arm just reacted strangely, ache, hurt like a toothache just where the vaccine had been placed on an unspecified date in Mar2021. Patient reported that there is a dot where the second dose needle went in her arm. She do not have COVID so assumed she should get it so they could keep living. After the first dose she do not even feel anything, had no reaction to that. The second dose hurt when it went in, but she thought it would go away. So for about 3 weeks she was fine after that. Starting on unknown date in Mar2021, about 3 weeks after she was administered the second dose her arm just reacted strangely, ache, hurt like a toothache just where the vaccine had been placed. It continued that way. Her arm had also sort of lost the strength in it too which still was not returned totally. Events are ongoing, still every once in a while would come back like a toothache; people say it would go away. She asked the expected duration of events; and if potential third dose is or is not recommended relative to events. Patient thought she was about 5 feet and keeps getting shorter, used to be more than 5 feet tall. But she vacuums, moves things around, trying to do what she should do; but events are continuing and she just wondered how long it would continue yet before it went away. Doctor said they would get a third dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, and she do not know whether she should relative to these events. The reason she got the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine doses in the right arm is because 2 years ago when she got the flu shot patient had a reaction where site was very red; so she thought she was not going to get injection in the left arm again because she is left handed. She knows that not supposed to get other vaccines, so she has not gotten the vaccine for shingles. The harder she tries to remember the worse it is, then she remembered vaccine for shingles. The physician put cortisone in her shoulder because he said it was something else, that he really do not think it was from the shot. She thought well she has had no accident, no fall, no bang, nothing to produce this other than the shot. He looked at it and gave her some exercises to do, so she was going to continue with therapy at the clinic; she goes to see the lady next week. Before all this happened it was going on and on and on. She had a problem with her knee on left side which the doctor looked at during that appointment. After the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine was administered, about 6 weeks ago she was working out in the yard. She do not think it had anything to do with the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included x-ray: unknown results on unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of calling to report pain, weakness to right arm, second dose hurt when it went in, arm had also sort of lost the strength in it too, twisted her knee a little bit/folding chair came down and slammed down onto her knee, deep bruise, arm just reacted strangely, ache, hurt like a toothache just where the vaccine had been placed, arm just reacted strangely, she hasn&#39;t gotten the vaccine for shingles, could only remember the itchy thing, problem with her knee on left side. The seriousness of the events was medically significant. The clinical outcome of arm had also sort of lost the strength in it too, deep bruise were recovering, of the arm just reacted strangely, ache, hurt like a toothache just where the vaccine had been placed were not recovered, of the calling to report pain, weakness to right arm, hurt when it, second dose hurt when it went in, twisted her knee a little bit/folding chair came down and slammed down onto her knee went in, she hasn&#39;t gotten the vaccine for shingles, could only remember the itchy thing and problem with her knee were unknown.

Spasms in stomach continue to date, as do weakness in legs to the point of using a walker to get arounds, and an overall feeling of unwellness.  Have had no fever.  Contacted personal physician 8 days after vaccine and was advised to take Tylenol, which I have been doing for a few days, but am now taking consistently every 8 hours as directed.

                                                Forty minutes after second shot, I got a bad pain in the back of my upper right thigh.  I had to limp to my apartment.  I didn&#39;t think it could be related to the vaccine as it was so soon, and only in the one place.  It had lasted until now and I&#39;ve had three physical therapy visits so far, though it is not as bad, but it&#39;s over three weeks.  I didn&#39;t think it could be related until my doctor&#39;s office said they had four cases of the exact same thing, and in younger people. (20&#39;s and 30&#39;s).  At first, the PT said it was due to a pulled muscle, though I had done nothing at all to account for that.

The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 15Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced urinary tract infection; the patient previously took clindamycin hydrochloride (DYNACIN) and experienced allergy, gabapentin and experienced allergy, doxycycline which made her pass out and lose complete control of muscles and everything and put her in the hospital for 3 days.

On 22Feb2021 she was prescribed cyclobenzaprine and tramadol as pain medication. Before she took any of the cyclobenzaprine or tramadol on the night of 22Feb2021 her legs collapsed on her. On 24Feb2021 they called the doctor and told them that she had collapsed again, and he said to stop the cyclobenzaprine and changed tramadol dose to half strength. She started being shaky. On 26Feb2021 they called the doctor back because she had the same symptoms with the addition of vomiting. They said to stop the tramadol and start taking TYLENOL. On 27Feb2021 they went back to the urgent care for the same symptoms as well as leg pain, thigh pain, hip pain, being really shaky and real weak.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with cyclobenzaprine (strength: 5mg) as a muscle relaxer and tramadol (strength: 50 mg) as pain medication both from 22Feb2021, tramadol was stopped on 26Feb2021 and TYLENOL (every 8 hrs. strength: 650 mg, Lot Number: SBA002, Expiry date: Dec2022) was started on the same date. The patient outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 87-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number was not reported), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 06Feb2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Left Hip Replacement from 17Dec2019 to an unknown date (she did experience a loss of feeling in her legs, and one time she even had a fall from it, like her legs did not hold her up). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took enoxaparin sodium started the product on 20Dec2019 and stopped it on 27Dec2019, even though she was supposed to take it for 14 days. Patient got the first shot of vaccine on 06Feb2021 and her only side effects were that her arm was sore which present till 09Feb 2021, and her left side of her neck was sore from 07Feb2021 to 09Feb 2021. On 09Feb2021, she was at her kitchen sink and it was like her muscles were being lost, in the top of her, but it stopped before it got to her legs, and then she felt okay. she had not experienced that again, but on 10Feb2021, she has felt a little week. Caller is wondering if that could have been a side effect of the vaccine. Patient stated that, she was taller but she thinks she is now between 4&#39; 11 and 5 foot. She got the vaccine in her left arm, and it was her left arm that was sore. she had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. Patient stated that after her hip replacement, she did experience a loss of feeling in her legs, and one time she even had a fall from it, like her legs did not hold her up. Patient stated that the fall occurred four days after starting a blood thinning medicine called Enoxaparin and once she stopped that medicine, she got to feeling better. she read somewhere that the COVID shot was given in the muscle, and that was why she thought the COVID shot might be related to her feeling like she was losing her muscles in her top half last night. The outcome of the event arm soreness, neck stiffness, left side of neck sore and muscles were being lost in the top of her, it stopped before got to legs was recovered and for other it was unknown.      Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 87-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 05Feb2021 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 15Jan2021 16:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity, Allergies to medications that contain dynacin; Allergic to Gabapentin; and has allergies to all antibiotics that end with &#39;cycline&#39;. Pertinent Details Include surgical procedures and dates: She was given doxycycline which made her pass out and lose complete control of muscles and everything and put her in the hospital for 3 days. The pharmacy gave her about 5 other medications that end with &#39;cycline&#39; and she was highly allergic to all of that so when she goes to the doctor she cannot take anything that has that in it. There were no concomitant medications. About a week after her second dose, she started having severe headache, pain in her legs, weakness, and fatigue. At one point, she collapsed because of weakness in her legs. Caller said they have gone to their HCP 6 times: 3 times with their urgent care doctor, 2 times with doctor, and 1 time in the emergency room. She wanted to know what to do with the adverse events. On 04Feb2021 she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and started on Cephalexin 7 day therapy as antibiotic and Phenazopyridine for pain with the UTI.

                                                She got the vaccine, and had no problems until Wednesday 3/17/21 at 3:00 AM she started coughing and could not coughing.  She finally got up and went into the bathroom and by 3:30 had coughed up little round, clear jellyfish.  Then she stopped coughing and went back to bed for 15 minutes, and then at 3:45 started getting diarrhea which she had until 10:30 AM.   She called Pfizer and reported her reaction and talked to them. During that time she had a lot of diarrhea and her body was starting to ache, joints and muscles.  She did not take her temperature and went back to bed, and slept until she could get up and go to the bathroom.  She then took her temperature and it was 100.7, which her normal is 97. 3.  She slept from 11:00 PM Wednesday until 11:00 AM Thursday.  She could not stay awake for long  before falling back to sleep.  Yesterday she did sleep most all of the day, and did not eat anything since Tuesday evening and did have a piece of toast yesterday.  Today, 3/19/21 she is able to get up, dressed and gotten downstairs to get something to eat and has lost 6# in this time period.  She is feeling wimpy, and her temp is down to 97.3, her pulse ox is 98%, pulse in the 70s.  She&#39;s achy, and has rubbed on Aspercreme  and has taken Tylenol a couple of times.  She is still very weak, probably dehydrated and going to get something to eat as she has just gotten up.  She is foggy thinking, but feels that once she rests, eats and gets strength she will be fine.

She is on a blood thinner and it  made the levels change and set off her A-fib .  The next 3 days she had body pain.  Her leg strength has weakened.   It has been over a month and she is not back to the levels of health she had before the second shot.  I also notice she rambles in conversation.

An 88-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 05Mar2021 13:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation (reason: giving them and because she had bone marrow disease and doctor thought she should get it) at doctor office. Medical history included 2 aortic valve replacements (last one was replaced 3 years ago in May and the first one was replaced 5 years ago), ongoing autoimmune disease and ongoing acid reflux, bone marrow disease and Covid. Concomitant medication(s) included prednisone (5mg once a day by mouth; she had been taking it for a number of years for a condition auto immune disease and she has to take it for the rest of her life) taken for autoimmune disorder, and pantoprazole (40mg once a day by mouth; started probably 5years ago) taken for acid reflux, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (Lot: EM9809) as dose 1, single on 12Feb2021 for covid-19 immunisation; flu vaccine for asthma (when she got a flu shot years ago, she had to go to ER for an asthma attack from that; it was way back in the 1990s; NDC, Lot, Expiration: Unknown). No investigation assessment was done. No vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Family medical history relevant to adverse event was none. The patient experienced sickness on 05Mar2021; fever chills on an unspecified date, sinuses and nose plugged up; diarrhea and upset stomach; stomach hurting; no appetite on 08Mar2021; sweating and felt hot; and skin and eyes burning and itching/her whole body is hot and itching; and couldn&#39;t sleep on 12Mar2021; hives at injection site/hives all over on 14Mar2021, hurts to breathe on 15Mar2021; cough on 17Mar2021; tiredness; joint pain on 21Mar2021; muscle soreness on 22Mar2021, weakness on 23Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of this with BENADRYL, Z PACK, MYLANTA AND TYLENOL. Clinical course was as follow: The patient stated that she wondered if should&#39;ve even had the vaccine. The patient had Covid in Mar2020 (a year ago in March) and she had long haulers until Jan2021. In March, her hematologist called and said she could get vaccine and stated that she shouldn&#39;t have. She stated that the second one made her really sick. This sickness was getting too long. Her second dose of the vaccine was on 05Mar2021. She was so tired; stated she doesn&#39;t feel good. She stated that she felt like she has long haulers all over again, it was horrible. Stated she felt like she shouldn&#39;t have gotten the second one. States she was doing okay with first one. Caller states that she already gave up a whole year of her life because of this. She tried to call before, but she didn&#39;t wait to talk to someone, she had to go somewhere. The patient stated that she had hives, tiredness, problems with her intestines, got really sick, her skin and eyes started to burn, she felt like she had hives all over, her skin was burning, she was sweating and felt hot, stated on the 14th it really got bad, her whole body was hot and itching. States that she took a BENADRYL and felt better the next 2 days and then started getting sinuses and nose plugged up and it hurt when she was breathing, had a slight fever, and her skin was itchy. She states that she went to doctor on 15Mar2021 (physician office visit), and he didn&#39;t think too much of it because her oxygen was okay. States that she felt worse, she was coughing bad, felt terrible, her muscles ache, and when she was hot, she couldn&#39;t sleep, now all she wanted to do was sleep and she had fever and chills. She was supposed to do exercises, but she couldn&#39;t, and it started two days ago. States she was not coughing as much but it was still hard and hurting. It was some of her joints, not all of her joints were hurting like when she had long haulers. Fever and chills started when her sinuses started acting up. The fever and chills kept getting occasional slips in and out. Her fever was not high but enough to get the chills. Sinuses and nose plugged up: it came and went with MUCINEX and it helped a little. Her intestinal problems were diarrhea that started on 08Mar2021 and upset stomach. She had a problem and it hurt terrible for days after. No appetite lasted for one week, so probably ended 15Mar2021. Caller states that she felt a little better but can&#39;t get rid of her cough. Couldn&#39;t Sleep: started when she had the burning and lasted a little after because she had to get herself together again. She could only sleep three hours at time. Skin and Eyes Burning and Itching: The burning and itching went away for a while, but it was back again because she had been lying in bed and tired, stated that it was not so bad. The burning stopped 15Mar2021 when the hives were gone, but she stated that right now it was back, her skin gets hot and then starts burning and itching. Patient stated that she did not have too much problems with first but this second, oh my god. She thought she got it too soon after having long haulers. She got rid of that in Jan2021 and was feeling good but now she felt terrible again. States there were no tests, she didn&#39;t have any. She was so weak, and she was having a hard time now, and she was doing so good. She was worried about her heart and valves. She guessed that call handler couldn&#39;t help her either, she stated that she didn&#39;t know what to do to feel better. She thought she had better call and report it. She has already gone to doctor and had only gone to him for 2 years, but hopefully he knew enough about her. She states that she probably should call him because she wasn&#39;t getting any better. The outcome for hives at injection site/hives all over was recovered on 15Mar2021, skin and eyes burning and itching/her whole body is hot and itching was not recovered, muscle soreness was not recovered, weakness was not recovered, cough was not recovered, tiredness was not recovered, joint pain was not recovered, fever chills was not recovered, sinuses and nose plugged up was unknown, diarrhea and upset stomach; stomach hurting was recovered on 11Mar2021, hurts to breathe was recovering , couldn&#39;t sleep was unknown, no appetite was recovered on 15Mar2021, sickness was unknown, sweating and felt hot was not recovered , sinuses and nose plugged up was unknown, skin and eyes burning and itching was not recovered, sweating and felt hot was not recovered.

                                                Confused; Disorientated; Sleeping a lot/Groggy; Headache; Felt very weak, felt very tired; felt very panicky; Dizziness; Felt like she had the flu; Chills; pain in her neck; she was cold; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  This 89-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number PFREL1283, Expiration Date 30Apr2021), via intramuscular, on 15Jan2021 (at 12:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing lymphoedema (she gets water in her legs), ongoing severe arthritis of both knee caps (she had a cortisone shot and lidocaine in her knees), and dust allergy. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine received in Jan2020 and in Oct2020 (with terrible reaction: pain in arm, numb in arm and muscle pain arm for 6 weeks). Past drug history included allergy to lidocaine (her face swelled up), and hydrocortisone (CORTISONE). She was in a wheelchair. Surgical history included 2 hip replacements. Relevant concomitant medications included drug for lymphoedema. The patient stated she started having side effects almost immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. She felt very panicky, felt very weak, felt very tired. She had like a headache. Some of the symptoms started the day she got the shot and then more symptoms arose the day after. She was very tired and was sleeping a lot the next day. She felt very like groggy. In fact, she was so groggy, she pressed the wrong button in her chair. She clarified she has lymphedema and she has to be in a lift chair to keep her legs elevated. When she needs to get up, she presses a certain button to raise and lift the chair into a sitting position. However, that day, her doorbell rang (her meals are delivered to her) and she was so groggy and confused, that she pressed the button that put her straight out into a lying position instead of a sitting position. She ended up sliding off the chair and onto the floor. She had to call for assistance (there is an emergency button she can press). She had to be lifted off the floor. She explained to them she didn&#39;t end up on the floor from walking, she slid off the chair. She was so disoriented she pressed the wrong button. She felt like she had the flu, she was cold, she had the chills. She was laying down, covered up with 2 blankets. She couldn&#39;t move. It was terrible. At the time, she slid off the chair, she had to go the bathroom. She is on a water pill which makes things worse, but she has a bedside commode close to her lift chair. When she was trying to get off the chair go to the bathroom (which is only 4 or 5 steps away from the commode), she was so disoriented, she pressed the wrong button. She has had this chair for 5 years.  She slid off the chair and ended up hitting the floor with her rear end. She remained on the nice cold floor (its a ceramic tile floor) until they came to pick her up. She mentioned she has had 2 hip replacements and once she is on the floor, she can&#39;t get up. Once assistance from where she lives came to pick her up, she was asked if she need to go the hospital or call ambulance. She explained to them she didn&#39;t fall. She slid off the chair. She is a very active person. Although she is almost 90, year is not senile. She slid off the chair, she didn&#39;t fall. The patient stated that she got the flu shot this past October and had a terrible reaction to that, too. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her system. She has had a flu shot every single year for the past 10-15 years and she has never had a reaction at all. She received the regular flu shot at her doctor&#39;s office in Oct2020 had a terrible reaction, she had severe pain in her arm where they gave her the shot, the pain wasn&#39;t at the injection site, the shot was high up the arm, her arm was numb and she couldn&#39;t raise it; she had muscle problems with the arm, she had trouble with her arm for 6 weeks. She has been taking naproxen sodium (ALEVE) for the headache. She has just been treating it symptomatically. No fever and she has just felt cold. The patient stated she really is not sick. She went to pick up dog medicine from the vet and when she leaves her facility, her temperature is always checked when she comes back. She was told her temperature was 97 something. So, she wasn&#39;t running any temperature prior to the vaccine. The patient was planned for the second dose on 05Feb2021. The patient stated her symptoms are not so severe it affects her breathing or something serious. It&#39;s just a pain in her neck to walk around with a headache. The outcome of the events was unknown.

On 2/20/21, patient received a first dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID19 vaccine 30 mcg/0.3 mL IM x 1 (lot# EL9261; left arm). Was seen in ED c/o back pain and bruising.  On admission Platelets=3k and Hgb=8.6.  Patient treated for Evans syndrome: ITP and hemolytic anemia. Patient received 1 units platelets, IVIG 55gm IV daily x 2 days, Rituximab 560mg IV weekly x 4 (1 dose given during this admission), dexamethasone 40mg IV x 4 days followed by a prednisone taper. Per hematology, &#34;spontaneous development of warm atuimmune hemolytic anemia as well as ITP is of unclear etiology. No malignancy has been isolated. There are some rare case reorts of ITP from COVID vaccination. Ultimately, we cannot prove whether this is due to the COVID vaccine.&#34;  Patient was counseled to not undergo the second dose of COVID vaccine.
