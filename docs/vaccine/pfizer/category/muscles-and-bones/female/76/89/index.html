                                                I have had a sore left arm since receiving the first dose on 1/16. VAERS report was put in and e-confirmation 294505. First dose was given in the right arm but caused pain in the left arm. With the 2nd dose due to the pain in the left arm, I got the 2nd dose in the right arm. There was just a sting when they put in the needle in. Today 2/10/2012 around 2-3 am I woke up and my arm is swollen. It is a little discomfort when I move my right arm.

Presented to MHN ED 2/2/21 @ 1100 for workup and initially declined admission and went home. Was called and asked to return for admission and further workup, admitted to MHN 2/2/21 @ 1750. Fever, myalgias, headache. CT abd/pelvis &#34;There is mild diffuse mesenteric edema surrounding the abdominal aorta and proximal branches. Additionally, there is mild bowel wall thickening involving the stomach without discrete mass. This is nonspecific and may represent infectious versus inflammatory changes.&#34; Per provider note &#34;flu-like sx over the weekend that easily coincide with the timing of the COVID Pfizer vaccine. In addition, I wonder if her CT scan findings might also be related to the vaccine.&#34; Discharged home the next day.

Today is Thursday and I am still quite tired, lower sore back ache.   Never had a fever.

Had to grab on to something due to a feeling that I was going to fall. It lasted just a quick second or two.  Happened several times that day.  Like what I would think a TIA would feel like.  Arm was just slightly tender and stinging the first day,.  In the night it was aching and hot up into my neck.  The next morning it was fine again. Just tender and a little stiff.  I attempted to report this on line at instructed on forms given me when I left the site. however the CODE that was to be sent to my phone never came. I then entered the wed site and attempted to report it there. .  Finally I called my primary Dr and he has instructed me to report this to the person giving the second injection.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 76years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed in 1999; Covid-19 from 23Nov2020 to Dec2020 (went to the hospital because of pain in her side at night. Was told she had pneumonia and pleurisy, she got it 2 days after her husband did, but hers was a mild case); her husband had Covid in Nov2020 and died in Dec2020 and hemorrhoids (from having babies years ago). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient scheduled her first dose for 27Dec2021. The patient had questions about it, but the person administering it did not speak English and she said that initially she did not have any reactions while she was there. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 27Feb2021 and has a lot of adverse events. After the getting the shot, she woke up at 0400 and experienced shaking (whole body was shaking), trembling out of control, hurting from her neck down to her toes, her joints were achy, hurt, and stiff, her teeth were chattering and couldn&#39;t stop, and when she tried to stop that it made it worse, when she got up she had hard time walking, so much that when she had diarrhea, she had diarrhea on the floor, she also noticed that the color of the diarrhea looked red and looked like it had blood on it but she was not sure. After that, she sat down in a chair and noticed that it had blood when she got up and suspected that she had hemorrhoids and bleeding because of the diarrhea. She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

Got up about 2AM to go to the bathroom; started back to bed; had a bad taste in mouth, so decided to brush my teeth.  Started brushing and all of a sudden, felt faint; before I could get the toothbrush back, I fell and my husband rushed over. Said I was out completely; got me awake and back up and went to bed and slept. until 11am.   At 3pm when taking a shower, noticed my left shoulder blade was real sore and looked and there were 3 red strips below should blade - no bleeding tho.  top R. side of head kinda sore, so must have hit when falling. Went back to bed and slept good.  Didn&#39;t need to go to the Dr. and am feeling good now.  Just rested for a couple days.  Had been feeling really good and don&#39;t take any prescriptions, so could only think it had to have something to do with the shot. Today is the 4th day and feel good.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation solution for injection, lot number: EL9262 and expiry date: 31May2021) via Intramuscularly to left arm on 22Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient medical history included bladder infection, blood pressure, she has some old age stuff like blood pressure, and she had Thyroid removed and takes a thyroid pill every day and she tends toward GERD. Concomitant medications included she does take other medications, but they are not relevant. Patient previously took Shingles shot for Shingles (Had the first of the Shingles shot but it was before that. She is due for the second one but she is putting it off for the COVID second dose). Patient reported that she got the COVID vaccine and was really excited because seemingly, she had no side effects. The shot did not hurt. Ten days after she go the shot, she got really hot at night and really strong muscle and joint aches on 31Jan2021. She was up almost all night. It just kept waking her up. So, she took something, an Ibuprofen thing to reduce fever and pain. The next night she took one proactively and did not have pain. The third night, she had it again but it was a headache all night and she was hot on 02Feb2021. It only seemed to happen at night. She felt like it was from the vaccine. She was not worried she had COVID. She had no breathing problems and did not feel like she was going to pass out. They said she should wait 48 hours and take a test to see if she had COVID. She did and it was negative. She does not feel any negativity toward the vaccine. She went in for a bladder infection and it was from a doctor&#39;s appointment that she got information and they told her she could go ahead and get it. Since she got the vaccine, she got white bump in the vicinity of the vaccine like a while mole, and another in the vicinity of the area as well. It does not itch or hurt. She noticed it about a week after the shot. She does not know the date. She was still on medication for a bladder infection but it would not have done anything. When she had reaction to the vaccine, it was already 10 days after she got the shot. She had asked them at Kaiser, and they think it was unrelated to any other medication. Outcome of event fever was recovered on 01Feb2021, for white bump near injection site was not recovered and recovering for all other events.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I think I am having a bad reaction to my covid shots.  The first shot was 1/31; a week later on 2/7  I started having headaches that travel around my head: some are behind my eyes and my teeth ache;  some more like migraines that go up the back of my head; some more on the top of my head or on the side.  My sense of taste changed.  My second shot was 2/27.  The day after I slept all day.  The headaches continued (I have had a headache of one kind or another since 2/7).  I had a tooth that broke off last June and was removed on March 8.  I thought the tooth was infected and part of the headache problems, but since then I have been having really bad fibro pain and for the week of 3/8- 12 I ran a fever, had chills and more headaches.  I was on amoxicillin from 3/8 to 3/14, but the tooth was not that badly infected and is healing well.  The headaches do not seem to relate to the tooth.  I have had a headache every day since 2/7 of various intensity and in different areas of my head.  I am extremely fatigued and need to nap some days.  My fibromyalgia symptoms are worse than they ever have been and some nights keep me awake.  I also muscle stiffness and spasms in my neck occasionally.  This is not normal for me. I saw a ARNP on 3/16 and she tested me for neurologic symptoms. Here are her notes:  NEUROLOGIC: negative findings: speech normal, mental status intact, cranial nerves 2-12 intact, gait, including heel, toe, and tandem walking normal, Romberg negative, muscle tone normal, muscle strength normal, rapid alternating movements normal, finger to nose normal, reflexes normal and symmetric   I have a video appointment with my primary care provider 3/26 to discuss this further

A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 17Mar2021 13:50 (at 76-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. Medical history included hip replacement four years ago in 2017 (First right then 2 months later left) and knee replacement six years ago in 2015 (both 2 months apart). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6203), administered in Left Arm on 25Feb2021 (at 76-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced bad headaches. The patient received the second dose of vaccine on 17Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, she was not hurting and went to brunch with friends. Afterwards (on the same date, 29Mar2021), she was sitting and got the worst pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. She drove herself home but was in such misery. She went to the emergency room the next day, on 30Mar2021, wherein she had a CT (computerized tomography) scan that showed a blood clot in her lower abdominal area. She was taking pain medication every 6 hours, or she could hardly stand it. On 08Apr2021, she went back to the emergency room because she could hardly stand it. She was kept in observation status but was not admitted. She was scheduled to have another CT scan on 06May2021. She is not sure what they will do because the nerves are wrapped around it. She also mentioned that her doctor wants to do a biopsy. The pain was also running down to her ankle. She stated that she has had both of her hips replaced in the past. She added that her doctor will do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). He will put in a drain if it has not shrunk. The doctor can&#39;t do anything because the nerves are all tangled up (2021). As corrective treatment, the patient was taking pain medication for the blood clot and pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. Outcome of nerves are all tangled up was unknown, while outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscularly administered in the right deltoid on 30Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number: GR8732 or 6R8732 [as reported]; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure/hypertension; had breast cancer twice with the last time was in 2010 to unknown date which was 23 years later than the first time she had it (1987). She had infiltrating ductal cancer, stage one, that was HER-2 positive. She states that this is the most malignant breast cancer. She had to have extensive chemotherapy and also took Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. The overriding symptom from her cancer was extreme fatigue; has been in chronic fatigue syndrome and in bed for 7 years, she was getting over chemo and she can barely walk. She has trouble walking long distances; had a mastectomy from 2010 to an unknown date without lymph node dissection; had a central node dissection; took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine; ongoing anxiety, depression and nervousness which is not new to her. She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children&#39;s allergy medication. She took half of a children&#39;s dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother&#39;s sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother&#39;s sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn&#39;t feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn&#39;t do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn&#39;t want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after. The patient declined safety report, saying that she is stressed and anxious (2021), she just wants to be transferred for her question. The reporter considered the events fatigue aggravated serious and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as medically significant. The outcome of the events fatigue aggravated recovering; as for the events blood pressure raised, &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39;, lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired were not recovered; while the event vaccination site pain was recovered on 01Apr2021 (reported as 2 days after). The outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events fatigue aggravated and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as serious (IME).Based on the plausible temporal association and product safety profile, the reported events are possibly related to the vaccine BNT162B2. administration. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.

                                                I already have some muscle pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0142, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 09:30 at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday (Thursday, 07Jan2021) and is scheduled to have the 2nd dose on 28Jan2021. She is asking if she should delay her Aerobics class the next day after the 28th because she knows that there are flu like symptoms that are associated with the 2nd dose of the vaccine. The patient stated, &#34;What are the side effects after the 2nd dose? I already have some muscle pain.&#34; The patient also denied having any problems or symptoms after yesterday&#39;s shot (as reported, pending clarification). No other vaccine received that day and none in the 4 weeks prior. Not had any problems with the vaccines in past.

Could not warm up, had two down comforters on. The chills eventually stopped but the headaches Intensified, also I could. Or move my near and shoulders. Went to the ER, they did not believe it had anything to do with the shot, I was there for 12 hours, had head exrays, spinal taps to test for meningitis, they searched for anything else I might have...nothing else.. they would not say if I should have the second shot, called pfiser this morning, they could not tell me if I should have the second shot, that I should aske my doctor.......If Pfiser  doctor  does not know if it is safe how could  my country doctor.

                                                The shot was given in my left shoulder.   Two days later the left shoulder blade became rather painful, making movement difficult.   E.g. turning my head to the left was very uncomfortable.   These symptoms lasted about two days -- by a week later they were gone   I used a hot pad and tylenol to become more comfortable.   Probably not a very significant issue, but it was uncomfortable,   I wondered if I perhaps had &#34;pulled a tendon&#34; or something like that.

No breathing problems. 5th February 2021 Pfizer 1st dose CV19 vaccine.  Scary symptoms started in grocery store parking lot around 6PM (after vaccine at 8:35A) my legs felt like they were partially paralyzed and I would not be able to walk to the car.  I struggled to walk.  Got home and laid down.  Thought it was side effects to vaccine and it would pass if I went to sleep.  Woke up and felt totally paralyzed and it required a lot of effort to turn on my side to try to reach my phone.  All my muscles and joints ached.  I am never sick and not a complainer.

Then I started to get the chills, chills that were so bad my body was almost convulsing with chills.  I ended up going to bed and I turned my electric mattress pad on to warm up.  I then slept very well and I don&#39;t think I moved all night.  I woke up sort of achy, but not much to be concerned with.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had anaphylactic shock in the past to a sulfur antibiotic. There were no concomitant medications. She stated she did not have an extreme reaction for the first 3-4 days, it was fine and went away. She had fatigue, joint pain, all the regular things and they were easing up. She had an appointment on the 20Jan2021 and thought things were going okay. On day 7, 20Jan2021, that night, she had an extreme reaction of blinding headache, the shakes, her whole body was shaking out of control for hours, her neck froze completely, and she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal (this is still occurring). The patient has had joint paint on 14Jan2021; extreme tiredness, weakness and muscle pain on 15Jan2021; chills, pain in her neck and muscles were so sore from 20Jan2021. She figured that was side effects, and she was handling, and then exactly a week after, she got the shakes so bad she shook for like 5 hours, she had to put nightguard in her mouth to stop from cracking, and severe headaches and her neck completely locked up, she couldn&#39;t move her head, and she still can&#39;t. She had extreme headache, and she went to the ER on 26Jan2021, since she was in really bad shape, they wouldn&#39;t believe her that it was a COVID reaction, she was there for 12 hours, they did every test, she had spinal taps, she had a head X-ray, everything, as they said she had meningitis, but then ruled that out, they wouldn&#39;t believe she was having a reaction to the COVID shot, she can&#39;t move her head, her joints and that are ok otherwise, but she can&#39;t move her head, she has pain in her neck, and she is taking Excedrin for that. She stated her doctor told her to go ahead and take the second dose of the vaccine and just take Tylenol after. She stated Tylenol has no effect whatsoever. If she takes Excedrin the headache will go away and Tylenol won&#39;t budge it. She stated she is taking Excedrin regardless of what the doctor says. When asked for age of onset, states she was on Valium and she was not thinking straight, and asked her husband her age. She was not sure why it was given, now provides name as Diazepam 5mg. Muscle pain is fine now, it went away. She went to the doctor on 20Jan2021, as she had a regular appointment for bloodwork to be done, and said she felt pretty good, she had some reaction but was fine, and that night is when she got shakes and shivers so bad, she had 3 quilts on and couldn&#39;t warm up, her body was out of control, she couldn&#39;t stop, now states for 3-4 hours. Severe headaches started the night of the 20Jan2021. Her neck pain started right after the shakes, so maybe she pulled muscles when she had the shakes, the muscles were so sore, and she couldn&#39;t move her head, like down or to the side, she couldn&#39;t move it, which is why she went to the hospital, to the ER. She was there for 12 hours. She started taking Excedrin, states she ignored what the doctor told her. She knows her body and she can take Tylenol and Ibuprofen like it is candy, and it does nothing, one Excedrin puts everything away, she swears by Excedrin. The outcome of the event shaking recovered on an unspecified date; Joint pain and Muscle pain recovered on 19Jan2021; Blinding headache/ severe headache, Fatigue/Extreme tiredness was recovering, chills/ shivers, couldn&#39;t warm up, Neck froze completely, pulled muscles, fatigue was unknown; she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal/ couldn&#39;t move her head, Pain in her neck, Muscles were so sore, Weakness was not recovered.

                                                Two hours after injection  severe pain in my right knee began and continues moderately today 3/3/2021.  (injection given at 1452) The doctor suggested heat/cold, anti-inflammatory,  brace and finally an x-ray which indicated nothing.  Four days after the second injection I&#39;ve experienced mild pain in my opposite thigh and fatigue. The second injection was given in the opposite arm (left). While chatting with others  in recovery after second injection about knee pain, another woman said she was experiencing the same and thought it was her arthritis but it felt different.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthmatic, had double pneumonia years ago, has ongoing atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker to control it as the only problem she has in her heart. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient was hospitalized for 2.5 days after having symptoms of a massive heart attack two days after the vaccine. It was reported that two days post vaccination, the patient was rushed to the hospital by ambulance as they thought she was having a massive heart attack. She added her symptoms lasted for hours, she had pain so bad that she was bent over and had a little trouble breathing. She said the pain was in the heart and underneath the rib, on the left side. She later mentioned she did not feel like it was AFib. She said they did every test possible and listed the following ones: ultrasound, stress test, x-ray (unknown results), and blood work in Feb2021. She specified that her blood work indicated a blood clot. She mentioned she was told by her personal friend, who was a doctor, that by having the shot sometimes it indicated you have blood clots when you really don&#39;t. The patient also specified that she broke out in a sweat, the pain was so severe that she  could not bend over and could not get up; therefore, they treated her as if she was having a massive heart attack for 12 hours at the hospital. It was reported that they kept giving her stuff to stop the effect with her heart.  She mentioned her second dose was scheduled on 25Feb2021. She asked if her experience was reported as a side effect to the vaccine and should she get the second dose of the vaccine. She explained the doctors did not know what she had, and she needed to determine if she can receive the second dose. She also asked if we could notify her if a similar reaction is reported. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing low thyroid and mostly it&#39;s food allergies. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 125 ug, daily for low thyroid. The consumer stated, I took the vaccine on Monday (25Jan2021), three days ago and as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I came prepared because I do have some reactions sometimes. Mostly it&#39;s food allergies but I guess was being prepared, so I took Benadryl with me and I took it out of the packet. When probed for the treatment, consumer stated, &#34;I just took Benadryl as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I was prepared and I took my Benadryl with me and we stayed there I guess about 45 minutes until I felt better it would have been 12:15 and I was fine.&#34; The consumer stated, &#34;I have been trying for two days, that was in my arms hurting a little on an unspecified date in Jan2021 and then today (28Jan2021) around noon I was feeling a reaction again. I had the tightening in my neck and around my mouth area that&#39;s where I usually get the reactions from, but for two days I have been fine and I did not eat anything on an unspecified date in Jan2021 out of the way to give me a reaction to it. Now I took 2 Benadryl and it subsided but it&#39;s still tight around my neck and a little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness. What am I supposed to do? After I took this shot on Monday today is Thursday and I am having the same reactions that I had when I took (incomplete sentence) (pending clarification). The outcome of the events as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange was recovered on 25Jan2021, little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness and tightening in my neck and around my mouth area was not recovered and other events was unknown.

                                                Experienced soreness at injection sight, slight headache, fatigue, chills, weakness in legs, indigestion (sour stomach). I was diagnosed with having Covid-19 on Nov. 9, 2020. I had a mild/moderate case which lasted over 2 weeks. After receiving my first dose of the vaccine in the morning, I started experiencing the same symptoms (in the evening) that I had when I had the actual virus. One week later, I&#39;m feeling better.

She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 77-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Jan2021 (vaccination age 77 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included: cholesterol, spinal fusion L4/5, stenosis, allergies to medications, food, or other products: kefex, Zithromax, levofloxacin, oxycontin, methylprednisolone, Lisinopril, ezetimibe, Amlodipine.  She reported she has constant spiking of her blood pressure (BP) and lack of sleep for 37 days (average 1-3 hours daily), since the vaccination. She described the following: She has experienced &#34;dizziness, blurred vision at times, extreme and constant headaches, tons and tons of pain in her neck&#34;. She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function&#34;. When she &#34;lays down&#34;, her &#34;heart is racing so fast and [her] BP gets so high that it won&#39;t let [her] sleep&#34;. She feels like her &#34;body is going crazy&#34;. She &#34;cannot get more than 2-3 hours of sleep other than 1-2 exceptions&#34;.  Also, her &#34;BP wakes her from a dead sleep&#34;.  When she wakes up, she usually &#34;takes a rice [pad] and applies hot and cold to her neck, and she sometimes takes some Tylenol&#34;. &#34;Every time [she] wakes up, her BP [readings] are around 152/101 and 160/97. She has been in and out of the hospital for her high BP.  After the hospital, she called (Number) because her BP &#34;was off the chart&#34;. Her cardiologist ruled out heart issues. She did an &#34;echo, a stress test and EKG&#34;.  On 01Feb2021 she was admitted to hospital with 200/103 blood pressure. Ruled out cardiovascular &amp; placed on Amlodipine. Now 37 Days later with many visits to doctors, blood pressure remains high. Cardiologist ran stress test &amp; echo with no heart issues. Placed on many Blood Pressure Medications that also created side-affects (urination, flushing, dizziness, extreme headaches); Amlodipine 5 mg, Metoprolol 25 mg, Alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed, Propranol 20 mg. Today, picking up yet another (Hydralazine?) as last-ditch effort. BP daily spikes remain high (160/99 and 175/100). Racing Pulse &amp; BP wakes me out of a dead sleep within 1-2 hours. So weak &amp; constant neck pain that feels like someone is placing pressure around my neck. The blood pressure medication received are the following: Amlodipine from 1Feb2021 until 9Feb2021. She explained it work well to manage her BP but she &#34;could not urinate and had red flashes in [her] face&#34;; therefore, it was stopped by her cardiologist. She was off the BP medication from 9Feb2021 until 17Feb2021. Metoprolol from 18Feb2021 until 25Feb2021, but it didn&#39;t work. She explained it was stopped by her doctor because of side effects. Propranolol in combination with Alprazolam as needed for anxiety. She explained she &#34;took 3&#34; of the tablets for anxiety. Hydralazine 25mg which she started yesterday, after seeing her cardiologist. She explained she only got 3 hours of sleep last night. She woke up around 1:30am/2am&#34; her heartrate was at &#34;93&#34; and she put heat and cold on her neck to settle the pain. She specified the headache and pain were so bad it lasted for 1.5 hours, and her BP was 150/93 at 3 am .She added she had a &#34;red and flushed face&#34; and therefore took a &#34;Benadryl at 4am&#34;. She explained her BP was down to &#34;125/78&#34;, after taking the Benadryl, but got up to &#34;147/90&#34; at 7 am when she attempted to call Pfizer. She explained she has &#34;done [her] due diligence: she consulted HCP, did all the test, she attempted to go for walks and do activities she can tolerate, but her symptoms persist. She added she use to golf and cannot anymore. She explained her symptoms are persisting until this day and her body won&#39;t handle it further. She mentioned she knows she is COVID-19 free because when helping take care of her quadriplegic son in the summer, she tested negative. Outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : PFIZER INC-2021277006 same patient, different vaccine dose/AE.

The patient clarified that she is having sleepless nights because of the coughing, choking, and burning and she feels that it is related to the vaccine kicking in. She slept last night, 14Jan2021. The cough is starting again today (as reported). She hopes it calms down. When she said her body was hot, like burning she was describing her sleepless nights. She is afraid. She is keeping in contact with her doctor. She figured she better call because more people are on this medication. The patient also experienced congestion on 06Jan2021. It was reported that the patient has shrunk and weighed less. Maybe 154 pounds. She was 170. The action taken for ciprofloxacin and pirfenidone was unknown. The outcome of the event congestion was not recovered, while unknown for the rest of the events.

I slept and took 1 800 mg Ibuprofen (on   1/27/2021). Am feeling better but still not feeling 100 %.  That may be due to increased allergies due to time of year of etc a

Unable to prepare meals, wash dishes, do laundry or other daily chores.  My son is typing this message for me.  At this time I do not plan to get the second injection.  Am sending this message to the CDC and Pfizer.  Two 650MG Tylenol gives me little relief.  I&#39;m hopeful that someone might suggest something else.

                                                I have osteoarthritis, with Heberden&#39;s nodes on all of my fingers.   3 days ago the two nodes on the most affected finger (and the first that showed the arthritis) turned bright red.  Now the whole joint is red and a few of the other nodes have turned red.    Except for binding the first finger with the hope it would help (it didn&#39;t), I&#39;m not treating them, since of course one can&#39;t do anything about osteoarthritis except ease the pain.

A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) second dose, lot number: EL9262, via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at a single dose in the upper part of left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EJ1686, expiry Mar2021, on 07Jan2021, she had no reaction or anything. The patient had no medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was calling about the second shot, Pfizer asked if there were side effects on the second one, and there were, she can&#39;t say what went on yesterday, it was that bad. She was a volunteer at the hospital. She lost 3 pounds in the last few days from this. She was in no condition to talk to anyone yesterday, and in fact, she was getting hot now. Yesterday (26Jan2021) was the worst, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe, but her sheets were soaking wet, she kept having to urinate, and she&#39;s ashamed, she almost couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom, her aide said to not be ashamed, and she had a lot of diarrhea. It was around 2am she noted her sheets were soaking wet, and it started going away at 5AM. She was still having effects from the shot: she was still getting very hot and cold. Getting very hot and cold started 12:00PM Monday (25Jan2021) night. Getting hot and cold was like the chills. She has 27 chronic illnesses but doesn&#39;t think they have anything to do with the shot. She was grateful she got the shot and hopes everyone at Pfizer was able to get the shot. The outcome of the event &#39;sheets were soaking wet, she kept having to urinate&#39; was recovered on 27Jan2021, diarrhea and getting very hot and cold was recovering, lost 3 pounds and chills was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Neurology consult 2/13/21:  This is a 78-year-old female we were consulted by Dr. for possible guillian barre s/p COVID vaccine.  The patient tells me that she was in her normal state of health, and she received her 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccineseen 7 days ago.  Subsequent to that, the next day she developed chills, fatigue that continued for approximately 2 days.  She states that 3 days ago, she woke up and was unable to lift her legs or get herself out of bed on her own.  She felt weak in her proximal lower extremities and her trunk.  She denied any bandlike sensations or paresthesias.  She cannot tell me that she developed any distal lower extremity weakness initially but felt that it was the acute onset.  She needed some help her out of bed when she was upright, she was able to use her walker to slowly get to the factor.  She may have had some urinary incontinence, she does complain of diarrhea now.   Denies any tingling sensation, no bulbar symptoms.  This is a 78-year-old female who we were asked to evaluate for possible Guillain-Barre syndrome.  She had acute onset of lower much greater than upper extremity weakness without any definite ascending features, of relevance, is that she received the COVID-19 vaccine 3 days prior to the onset of her symptoms.  She did exhibit flu-like symptoms prior to this.  Given that she does not have any specific area of intrathecal enhancement to suggest Guillain-Barre or other areas of radiculitis, I think it is reasonable to proceed with lumbar puncture to look for any other source.   --Given the findings on the MRI cervical and lumbar spine including enhancement of the bilateral sacral S1 region, I would like Neurosurgery to further evaluate. -- would likely benefit from CT chest abdomen pelvis to rule out any underlying occult malignancy particularly if workup remains unremarkable. -- continue supportive care, monitor for shortness of breath, new vital capacities  Patient remains admitted to the hospital with continued weakness at the time of this report

A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EN5318 expiration date: 31Jan2021, via an unspecified route of administration on 31Jan2021 12:20 at a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no family medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had her first dose yesterday (31Jan2021), and she had some reactions to it last night 31Jan2021, had fever, headache and pains in knee and muscle above knee. She knows some of the side effect was normal. She was wondering more so, when is it ok to take a pain reliever for it, like aspirin or Ibuprofen. She went online and it said not to take anything, so she did not. She imagined her fever went away sometime during the night, she took it (unspecified) twice last night. This morning when she woke up, she had the headache, and it&#39;s gone now. Her pain in the knee started 4 hours after the injection, it was still sore but much better. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The outcome of the event fever was recovered on 31Jan2021, headache recovered on 01Feb2021 and for events pains in knee and muscle above knee was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I was vaccinated with Pfizer for the first time 11 days ago. Within a few minutes of being vaccinated, I felt nauseated but I did NOT throw up. I have been sick ever since with one thing and another. For the first several days after being vaccinated, I had a sore arm, which I expected. I have also experienced extreme fatigue, chills, nausea, muscle and joint aches, a sore throat (briefly), an occasional headache, tenderness in my left armpit and along the left side of my rib cage, stomach pain and diarrhea and at times, a low-grade fever and sweating. My memory and ability to focus on my work have been affected. Yesterday (March 13), I felt OK all day and thought I was better at last, but after I ate dinner, I vomited and had diarrhea. I told my primary care physician about all of this in an email and she replied that my symptoms were &#34;normal.&#34; I&#39;m not so sure. I haven&#39;t read of anyone else feeling so sick for so long after the first dose of Pfizer.

This nurse (patient) reported that a 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6204) at the age of 78-years, via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 at single dose; first single dose of BNT162B2 (lot: EM9810) on 11Feb2021; both for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoarthritis (having aches and pains) had for 20 years; large sliding hiatal hernia was diagnosed from an EGD six months before, didn&#39;t want surgery to fix it; heartburn (last five years); fatty liver, was not from drinking alcohol; generalized anxiety; was tuberculosis positive only because she was exposed years ago. Concomitant medications included pantoprazole started four to five years before at 40 mg twice a day for heartburn; escitalopram (tablet) been on for 15 years or longer at 10 mg 1 DF every day for generalized anxiety; clonazepam 0.5 mg nightly at bedtime for anxiety (been taking for last ten years or more, stops her from worrying about her kids and stuff like that). The patient experienced on 07Mar2021, low grade fever, weakness, chronically dehydrated and cough; on 15Mar2021, rash, acute pain and with deep breaths; on an unspecified date, no desire to eat or drink. Seriousness criteria of these events were reported as disabling. Patient reported that was having major problems, a delayed immune response. Told everybody if this keeps up she was not going to make it. It was wearing her down and she was not going to survive. Occurred after second COVID vaccine. She is active, goes to pool, and does different things. Had vaccine on Thursday and was ok until Sunday. Started Sunday with low grade fever. Kept being low grade and never got to 101, 102, or 103. She didn&#39;t take ibuprofen. Usually takes ibuprofen once a day for routine aches and pains. Having weakness. Had no desire to eat or drink. She waited a couple days, but then called her doctor. Doctor&#39;s office wouldn&#39;t give her an appointment. Stated this wasn&#39;t the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller&#39;s daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn&#39;t feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn&#39;t her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn&#39;t order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn&#39;t itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn&#39;t take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn&#39;t want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn&#39;t right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn&#39;t nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn&#39;t help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn&#39;t make her sick, just didn&#39;t want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren&#39;t really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn&#39;t feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn&#39;t itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn&#39;t think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn&#39;t working and her body couldn&#39;t get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn&#39;t think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like &#34;oh that second shot.&#34; If she didn&#39;t get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn&#39;t know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn&#39;t take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn&#39;t want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn&#39;t think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn&#39;t know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn&#39;t say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn&#39;t feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

A 78-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE)), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 17Mar2021 12:10 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 31May2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization.

The Ibuprofen stopped the shaking and she can remember to touch her body felt warm but then she was freezing and she does not know what this means but this was not ongoing and resolved when her husband gave her the ibuprofen and she stopped shaking right away which always amazed her that the Ibuprofen worked. She stated fortunately the Ibuprofen stopped her from shaking and she was able to sleep until early morning when she woke up and knew she was sick and was different and very weak; states the weakness was not ongoing and the approximate time the weakness resolved was unknown but she was down the rest of the day and after that she passed out for a very short period of  time and held her head up and stood up and thought wow something was going on and asked where was this coming from and it was not nausea but she was just weak. She has not passed out for a huge amount of time but fortunately she had some towels laying close by and was able to use a towel; states after that she stopped for the rest of the day and only got up to go to the potty and was just so weak and heard that from many people that they just slept afterwards.Caller states her muscles were sore and she realized that was just normal and after the 2nd dose of the vaccine she knew her muscles would probably be sore and this was resolved. She came downstairs and was sitting on a chair and then stood and no longer sat in the chair and her husband knew things were not right with her and her eyes looked funny and she passed out and that never happened to her before and she was passed out for a few moments. Other than the Ibuprofen she did not have treatment and did not go to the emergency room or the HCP office.

She exercises regularly and has become so weak that she cannot climb stairs.  Neurological exam revealed hyperreflexia, subtle proximal muscle weakness, the presence of a startle reflex and rooting reflex, clonus, and a positive Babinski.  Infectious work up has been negative, autoimmune evaluation is underway.  Inpatient neurology consultation has been obtained, she was given a trial of diazepam for stiff person syndrome and started on daily IVIG on 2/3/2021 for a 5 day course. She continues to have an elevated CRP, a mild transaminitis, and mild thrombocytopenia.  The ESR dropped from 44 to 20 with hydration.  She has had no cognitive changes. No headache, visual changes, jaw pain. We are unable to obtain MRI given the presence of these coils which are not MRI compatible.  Encephalitis immune antibodies are pending, myositis panel, MOG antibodies ADEM are pending, GAD65 antibody pending.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection lot number: EN6201), intramuscular at upper left arm on 17Feb2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis in right shoulder and arm gets inflamed and sore; rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm. It sometimes flares up and gets sore) diagnosed in late 2019, ongoing Autoimmune deficiency disease diagnosed in late 2019 and lower left eyelid which was inverted. There were no concomitant medications. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient previously took Shingrix vaccine (Shingles vaccine) at left arm last year-2020 and she felt soreness and achiness in right shoulder and arm. The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine yesterday on 17Feb2021 at her left arm. A few hours later her right shoulder and right arm felt sore and achy. On 18Feb2021, the patient&#39;s right arm and shoulder were aching. The patient mentioned that this has also happened last year when she had a Shingrix vaccine. She was also injected in her left arm but her right arm got sore and achy. She felt soreness and achiness in right shoulder and arm. She wanted to know if this is a normal reaction from the vaccine. The patient stated that it was weird. On unspecified date, when she lifts her arm up high it hurts, she stated that she does have an inflamed shoulder. She did have an inflamed shoulder prior, it has been pretty good lately but flared up after the vaccine. During the night it was very bad. She does have rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm. It sometimes flares up and gets sore. She was wondering if there is a relationship with the COVID 19 vaccine because she felt like she got the COVID 19 vaccine in the right arm, she asked if she&#39;s reacting to the medication. No treatment was administered for right shoulder. Routine lab work done on 02Feb2021 but it has nothing to do with this. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The patient is also scheduled to have Botox in her lower eyelid for her left eye to release the nerve muscle. She asked if it is ok since she just had the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She is scheduled to get botox injection next week for lower left eyelid which is inverted, it was bothering her. They have to release the muscle by getting an injection of botox. She was receiving conflicting information from her PCP, who says wait a month and her ophthalmologist who says its ok to get the COVID 19 vaccine. She thought she heard something about not mixing botox with the vaccine. The outcome of the event &#34;She did have an inflamed shoulder prior, it has been pretty good lately but flared up after the vaccine/She does have rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm&#34; was unknown; and other events was recovering.

Medical history included shoulder surgery about 10 years ago and she lost use of her thumb and index finger, the nerve comes from the shoulder; her hand might be numb and stiff, often but not every morning from an unknown date. Concomitant medications were reported as she is on medication but nothing she feels is relevant. On 03Feb2021, the patient experienced pain in her hand and all the lower part of each finger hurt for about 5-10 seconds, joint pain in her right hand lasting 10-15 seconds, it did not last very long; and she bled quite a bit stating she thinks she got it right in the vein on 27Jan2021. The pain happened about four different mornings but has not had pain &#34;since Friday&#34; and that was lighter sharp pain with no numbness. The clinical outcome of the event bleeding was unknown; pain in extremity and joint pain was recovered on 12Feb2021.

Took Benadryl, and symptoms resolved after about an hour.

By nighttime I could barely move my head to the left and pain was severe.  i was very chilled and could hardly stop shivering until I took a heating pad and dressed warmly and went to bed.  Sunday, still have a lot of pain and taking aspirin for the pain.  Also will use SalonPas for the painful areas to see if that helps.  Still cannot move my head to the left without pain.

She noticed her right knee was swollen about a week ago. It was slightly swollen, just a little bit, it was not hurting, just swollen. It had improved since it began. Product details: She confirmed she got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. All she had was a doctors office card that had a date and time for her to be back.

It was just the name of her primary care doctor then it had their name and address and the phone number and they told to her to bring it back with her. She did not see any NDC, lot number, or expiration date. She said it was just a doctors office card like they use to write you an appointment reminder.

No PQC present.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                It started with a feeling as though I was getting a sore throat.   I took an Emergen-C drink and went to bed at normal time.  I also had more drainage than normal from my head.  During night I felt a fierce sore throat.  Next day, sinus headache, slight sore throat, additional drainage from head.  Last meal that day was lunch.  Going to bed, I vomited.  Next day, sinus headache, drainage, cough and yellow phlegm from lungs--a cough.  Took Tylenol during these times.  Vomited before bed.  Next day I took Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold meds in a.m. and again in afternoon.  Felt better.  Ribs very sore from coughing.  Appetite began returning.  Congestion much improved.  Following day (today) still congested but improved.  No meds so far today.

A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 18Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included family history of glaucoma from 2019 (Her mother has Glaucoma); memory ain&#39;t that good (she puts everything on her calendar because her memory ain&#39;t that good); ongoing irregular heart beat since 2006 (periodically when she goes to the doctor they have her walk the treadmill and stuff like that); ongoing diabetes since 2011; and was allergic to Penicillin (as a kid she was bitten by a dog, she must have been about 12 years old, went to hospital they gave her a shot of penicillin, her head blew up, she looked like a monster, she went back they gave her Streptomycin). Concomitant medication(s) included brimonidine taken for glaucoma from 21Feb2021 to 01Mar2021; latanoprost taken for glaucoma; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for arrhythmia, and dyspnoea from 2019 and ongoing; and metoprolol taken for arrhythmia. The patient was administered with her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021. It went beautiful, she did not have any aftereffects or anything initially. On 01Mar2021, while in her own apartment she stood up to go to the bathroom and could not put her right leg down; she thought she was having a heart attack or a stroke or something and she fell on her right side. She went to the hospital where she was hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. MRI performed during that hospitalization had result of Cerebrovascular Accident-CVA. She also reported onset of diarrhea and nose running around 01Mar2021. When she went to the hospital on 01Mar2021 she was laying down, and when the doctor moved the blanket to test her legs her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt. The events were reported to have required a visit to the emergency room. They did not find anything else during hospitalization with testing. The only thing she can think of related to these events was the COVID-19 vaccine. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled for 11Mar2021 relative to these events. She was scheduled for second dose on 11Mar2021, but she is scared because of events that occurred 01Mar2021. The outcome of the events diarrhea, &#34;Nose running&#34;, &#34;Her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34;, &#34;her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder on 11Feb2021 at age of 79-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization; methylprednisolone (MEDROL, Tablet), orally from 20Feb2021  to 26Feb2021, at 4 mg, by mouth, frequency was different based on the day, from 27Feb2021  to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose for swelling, the back. Medical history included thyroid and pericarditis fluid. Family history included brother had heart disease. There was no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) ongoing for thyroid for 20 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 in left shoulder on 21Jan2021 (Batch/lot number: EN6201) for COVID-19 immunization with no side effects.  The patient had her 2nd Pfizer vaccine dose on 11Feb2021 and received a &#34;medrol pack&#34; on 20Feb2021 for &#34;shoulder, back and neck pain. She have felt lousy for 4 weeks. She went to the hospital with palpitations and it probably was from the 2nd pack of methylprednisolone, she was prescribed after the 1st pack did not really help her pain. She haven&#39;t been sick or had a cold for 25 years and the 2nd dose through her for a loop. She stated her daughter called her and she said that her doctor told her that her vaccine may not be effective and she may not be protected because she took methylprednisolone. The patient received the second vaccine on 11Feb2021 and she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling. The patient mentioned she went to her doctor because after calling the COVID hotline they said they had cases where some of the vaccine had seeped into the lymph nodes. She was told to have her lymph nodes. No patient demographic details provided regarding those other patients who had the vaccine seep into lymph nodes. She went on to explain she went to the doctor, but the doctor said there were no problems with the lymph nodes. On 13Feb2021, she felt achy and fatigued, back discomfort. The lightheadedness occurred on 18Feb2021. The doctor gave her a high dose of the methylprednisolone 4mg pack for a week. 16 days later on 27Feb2021 it had not touched the discomfort in back, fatigue and lightheadedness and gave her another pack of methylprednisolone.  She also had heart palpitation, was sweaty and went to the Emergency Room. The patient mentioned she took a low dose of levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). She asked the doctor about the methylprednisolone being taken after the shot. The patient heard it diminished the effect of the shot, that she may not have as much protection. She had called the COVID hotline to address this issue and they said people who were on chronic steroid therapy had no problem as far as they know. The patient asked if she was protected because she had the methylprednisolone pack the first one within 9 days after shot and a second pack 16 days later. She took a low dose of generic levothyroxine sodium every day. She commented she was concerned with the drug interaction and wanted to make sure still protected. She was informed by individual who answered COVID hotline she felt like she was still protected because others have been on chronic steroid therapy. Shoulder swelling started a couple day after the second shot, explained it was there or about around 13Feb2021. Her shoulder blade was puffy and tender. The swelling went into the arm and breast. Her breast felt like it weighed 60 pounds and ached. That took a while to go away. The patient explained initially it was also there or about around 13Feb2021 when she noticed she was so fatigue and had the worse headache (Feb2021), she never got nauseous. Her shoulder was still swollen a week ago as of 09Apr2021. She went to a chiropractor for an adjustment and the chiropractor said shoulder was still a little swollen. She had terrible back pain in center of back on 18Feb2021. It was so much that she was afraid something else was going on. The patient stated the swelling it was ongoing up until a few days ago as of 09Apr2021. She still had puffiness around that area when went to chiropractor. For the back discomfort she went to chiropractor for adjustment. She was unsure when that discomfort went away. The achy feeling was ongoing with her muscles and legs until last week as of 09Apr2021 when she started to feel better. Her legs felt rubbery. Her muscles felt achy. She felt better as of 09Apr2021. It had gotten better within the last week as of 09Apr2021. The fatigue was ongoing until last week as of 09Apr2021. The patient felt so bad for month and had no idea what was going on. Her lightheadedness went away last week as of 09Apr2021. She commented she did not want to blame all of this on the shot because she did not know what methylprednisolone did to her. The patient confirmed she had back discomfort. She still had some back discomfort. She started to fell short winded a week before the heart palpitations appeared really bad on 21Mar2021.

AN 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: 30Jun2021) intramuscularly in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at 13:00 (at the age of 80-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included highly sensitive and highly allergic to everything from food to medicine; had been through near death with allergies; allergic to penicillin, iodine and shellfish; high blood pressure, eye disorder (unspecified), allergies with her sinuses. Concomitant medications were not reported, but the patient took unspecified high blood pressure and eye medication. The patient previously took dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride (DARVON), ether and castor oil and experienced allergies; sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) for severe acute sinusitis on Jan2021 (about a month ago). On 11Feb2021 at 13:20, the patient start feeling dizzy and faint like, and felt a little tired. She came home and went to bed and on 11Feb2021, had itching on the right shoulder (where she had the vaccine) and on the right side of the arm near the elbow, the middle part of the stomach and the neck (itching came and went) and later, her sinuses started to drain. On 12Feb2021, the patient&#39;s feet felt stiff and the bone in the right leg felt strange. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient had pain in the shoulder. The patient queried if she can take aspirin for the pain in the shoulder and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) if the itching comes back. The clinical outcome of pain in the shoulder was unknown, of &#34;itching on right side of arm near elbow, middle part of stomach and neck&#34;, &#34;feeling dizzy and faint like&#34;, tired, sinuses started to drain, &#34;feet felt stiff and bone in right leg felt strange&#34; and &#34;itching on the right shoulder (where she had the vaccine)&#34; was resolving.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249, expiration date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on her left arm on 30Jan2021 to 30Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took phenytoin sodium (DILANTIN) and carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) and experienced allergy as her reaction to those were sometime between 2010 and 2012. On 30Jan2021 after three and a half hours, the patient felt sensation at her foot for that she could not walk, experienced chills, hands were shaking, had a swollen ankle and foot and pain. Around 5 o clock, the patient stated that it was like a strange sensation in her foot and she also got chills. By 7 o clock, she was in pain. The patient stated that she took two Tylenol. The patient stated that at around 9 o clock, she noticed that her ankle and foot were swollen with red blotches on it so she took two Benadryl and then slept until noon. The patient stated that Benadryl actually gave her some relief, although the pain didn&#39;t completely subside, but it subsided a little so that it was more tolerable. The patient stated that she had been debating if she should have gone to the emergency room (ER), but she didn&#39;t because she has a high pain tolerance. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 80-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9266 and expiry date 31May2021, via unspecified route of administration on 15Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included, broke her elbow from 04Dec2020 and surgery from 12Dec2019 and second surgery was from 15Jul2020; the patient thought that the second surgery on her arm was in 2020 and she actually broke her arm in 2019. She thinks it was actually Dec2019 when she broke her arm and the second surgery was on 15Jul2020; ongoing with the arm the pain and movement in that arm (movement disorder) and arm; weakened (same arm that she broke). There were no concomitant medications. The patient was taking the same medications she always takes, and she waited until after the dose to take them. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 lot number EL02162, expiry date 31May2021 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient was calling about the vaccine, the second Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She experienced some side effects, there was joint pain on 15Feb202 later that nigh and the most obvious thing was exhaustion that began later the same day as well; but one thing was unusual, the strange side effect that has happened on 16Feb2021 was that her hand felt like it was sleeping especially her finger tips it felt like neuropathy but it was much better now, it was the same arm that she broke, it seemed weaker now which it seemed like the side effects go to areas that were weakened before. The patient stated that the main thing was the neuropathy thing, it felt like she was sitting on her hand and that persisted, but it was 90 percent better and she thinks it will go away. The neuropathy feeling was ongoing but much less, it was improved it happens only if she squeezes her hand so it was much less and she hoped it just dissipates. The patient&#39;s main concern was the neuropathy and it has improved a great deal. The patient mentioned with the arm the pain and movement in that arm has worsened since the injection (Feb2021). The worsened pain and movement has persisted about the same since she noticed it. The patient informed that was the joint she guessed, because she broke the elbow. The outcome of the events hand felt like it was sleeping especially her finger tips it felt like neuropathy, joint pain, exhaustion was recovering, same arm that she broke, it seemed weaker now which it seemed like the side effects go to areas that were weakened before was unknown, while not recovered for the rest of the events.

This 80-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Covid shot, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3246; NDC number: Unknown; Expiry Date: Unknown) from an intramuscular route of administration via left arm on 02Feb2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history included ear ache in right ear and cold. She explained she did have an ear ache in right ear, she figured she must have had a cold. She was using ear drops and it just sort of went away. She clarified this was prior to the vaccine. It started over a week or 10 days ago, she guesses. She doesn&#39;t recall. She believes the ear ache was cleared by Tuesday before receiving the vaccine. The patient was received unknown concomitant medications. No other vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient experienced pain in the neck that makes it hard for her to move it from side to side and pain down her neck on her right side on 04Feb2021. The patient had the first COVID-19 shot last Tuesday evening and everything was fine. Probably on Thursday she started getting pain down her back, clarified as her neck, on her right side. Like, she can&#39;t hardly turn her head left or right without turning her whole body. Patient declined to include a healthcare professional for the report. She confirms she started having pain in her neck on the right side. She clarifies she had an ultrasound last Friday because they were concerned with her liver. They called that night and that was fine. However, Friday morning when she went in for that appointment, she really didn&#39;t have any pain in her neck. Therefore, it had to have been after. It must have actually started either Friday night or Saturday. Caller explains she paid no attention to the pain until yesterday so she thought she would call today. She was not sure about vaccination time stated had a 7 o&#39;clock appointment, so maybe by 7:30-7:45PM. The outcome of events was reported as not recovered.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown.

By Sunday afternoon, less discomfort, but still a headache. During this discomfort time, I would take 2 Tylenol (500 mg), which relieved it. Before I settled down for the night, I took 1 Tylenol and when I woke up at 3:00 a.m., the ache was not there (the Tylenol would have worn off by then). Monday a.m. ... could walk much better. The headache and the constant muscle ache are gone.  Nurse called; I am to keep watch, and if there are any changes for the worse, I will go into the Dr.&#39;s office.

I had never felt pain in my hips and was alarmed by it. I didn&#39;t associate the pain with the COVID-19 vaccination until Jan. 22, when I heard a doctor in a video from the Health Department talking about the vaccinations. The city communication system had sent the link to me, unrequested, in an email. The doctor listed possible side effects, including hip pain. I searched the internet for lists of side effects, although I had read them in newspaper reports and had heard them in coverage of the pandemic and vaccines. I was unaware of hip pain specifically or joint pain being on the list.

An 81-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3249, expiration date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization; ibuprofen, and paracetamol (TYLENOL), both via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unknown dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included knee pain from an unknown date. The patient clarified she had been dealing with this knee pain prior to receiving her first dose of the vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the vaccine on Friday (15Jan2021) and she had a knee that was giving her a fit. She was not sure if she had twisted it or if it was arthritis. She just wanted to know if there were any over the counter medications she can take such as Tylenol or Ibuprofen that she could take for knee pain that will not interfere with vaccine. She confirmed it was her knee, she thought its arthritis, it had swelled up before but it was very painful, and she was wondering if there was any medications that might be in fair with this vaccine such as Tylenol or Ibuprofen or anything like that. She said this morning it was a little better after being off it last night, it was not as painful this morning. She said previously she had been taking Tylenol or Ibuprofen and it would help it a great deal but she wanted to check since she had the first shot Friday to see if taking that would interfere with anything. The action taken in response to the events for ibuprofen and paracetamol was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 21Jan2021 08:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included lymphoma from 2018. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer. The patient previously took rituxan for lymphoma (Reported she had been in remission for a little over a year. She said she had received only 4 Rituxan infusions for the lymphoma before she went into remission). 12 hours post injection: she &#34;experienced significant rigors and shaking, muscle and joint aches, her equilibrium was off at some point, she was tired, had generalized pain, and chills&#34;. She also confirmed feeling better.  She stated she heard the the second dose of the vaccine caused more reaction than the first dose and would like to validate the information. She explained the first instance she experienced rigors was after a lymphoma treatment. She believed the rigors lasted &#34;12 hours&#34; but was not certain because she &#34;fell asleep and got warmed&#34;. The patient felt great all day on 21Jan2021 after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said almost exactly 12 hours later, she started to have rigors. She was shaking so hard that her hands and body were jerking. Her muscles and joints were hurting, her equilibrium was off, she ached all over, she had pain, felt tired, and she had chills. The rigors started first. She said she felt really cold at the same time, so she went to bed and covered up, trying to get warmed. She fell asleep for awhile, and then woke up and went to the bathroom. When she went to get out of bed to go to the bathroom, she stood up, and every bone and muscle in her body hurt. She said she was aching all over, and her equilibrium was off. She didn&#39;t feel like getting up, and finally went to sleep to get the rigors to stop. She felt cold all the time now, but the rest of her symptoms had improved. She said it seemed like the muscle in her right leg was still pretty sore. She said she recovered from the rigors completely. She had rigors once before when she had an infusion. She clarified the infusion was Rituxan. She said she had a reaction to her first treatment of Rituxan. She said she had rigors when the Rituxan infusion was first started. She was given a couple things (but she didn&#39;t know what those things were), and she stopped shaking. She said the infusion staff waited a few minutes and tried to restart the Rituxan infusion, but she would have rigors again. She said the infusion staff tried slowing down the Rituxan infusion rate, as well. She said the Rituxan infusion normally takes 2 hours, but after 8 hours, she had only got about 20% of the Rituxan infusion, before the Rituxan infusion was stopped. She stated she had 3 subsequent Rituxan infusions at later dates, and did not have any problems with those infusions.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

As I examined the area several times during the next couple of hours I noticed a lump.  The lump was moveable, but seemed about the size of a nickle.  It scared me even though it was not actually in my breast.  The doctor told me since it was moveable and felt smooth he thought it to be a reaction to the Covid vaccine, but ordered a mammogram.  I called for the mammogram and was told I could not have one until 4 weeks after the 2nd shot.  I have a mammogram scheduled 3/26/2021.

Within minutes, my left thump had spasms and painful cramping and &#34;froze&#34; I massaged my thump for about 5 minutes and the pain subsided.  I then had painful cramping in my left calf and then the entire leg which then followed by Muscle pain and cramping in both legs.  I was told that I should exercise, so I went for a long walk.  When I returned home, i felt even worse so I went back to bed. Headaches began. I had flu-like symptoms (chills and discomfort) I covered my self with two blankets and drank lots of water and took an Aleve.which upset my stomach.  3/03 (the next morning), my usual sinus stuffiness was Gone! and I could breathe better than i have in a long time (by days end my sinusitis had returned) and so had my headache. Today 3/04 I still feel exhausted and I have swelling, puffs under my eyes (not usual) and occasional headaches.  My Left Arm (area of the inoculation) Has Never Been Painful!!!!!!

                                                1/22  8:000 PM  had 3 jerks quick jerks of left arm,  1/23 around 11:30 when laid down on and off little jerks from head to toe on and off.  When I woke up  around 8:30 could feel some.   During day some little ones mostly arms or hands, once in a while legs,  Monday 1/23 around 9:00 PM a hard jerk on left shoulder and at night kind of a hard one on left arm.   Seemed to have seattled down to mostly subtle ones in hands or arms on and off.  Legs feel kind of stiff or tight.    Once in awhile felt pulsating through out, but that seems to have gone away.  Mild pain feeling around shoulder blades on and mostly off.  Never had before.

I was beginning to get slight pain in my back by late afternoon the same day.  By bedtime, it was much worse.  I woke up around 2:am to go to the bathroom.  I couldn&#39;t even stand up.  My husband was able to help me and get me back to bed.  I had excruciating pain with every step.  I couldn&#39;t bend, turn, etc.  I spend all of the next 2 days in bed.  Yesterday, on the 3rd day, I was able to sit in a chair for a short time.  Today I am better and can get along without assistance.

Medical history included neuroendocrine tumour of the lung and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Diagnosed 15 or so years ago). There were no concomitant medications. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available): N/A. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. Any AE(s) did not require a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. It was nothing severe.

On the 6th and 7th, she had muscle aches, fever, she was sweating and had general malaise. These symptoms felt important enough to report, she doesn&#39;t know if Pfizer is keeping track of it or what. When probed for consent to contact, the caller explains the doctor she had been seeing is no longer practicing, and she just started seeing this doctor. She doesn&#39;t know how much this new doctor is going to help. Caller adds that she also experienced diarrhea. She was a little bit better yesterday, but she feels fine today. She states she maybe a little tired today, but nothing else. She is fine. Her daughter had a question that she wanted the caller to ask. These symptoms do not mean she should not get the second shot? These are pretty normal side effects, aren&#39;t they? From what she has read they are. She is scheduled for her second vaccine on 26Feb2021. Vaccination Facility Type: there is a special area roped off just giving shots to public. The outcome of events was recovered on 08Feb2021 and for event (tired) was unknown.

It&#39;s more in my right arm and I cannot lift my arm when it&#39;s happening and it leaves me weak, trembling and in a cold sweat and sometimes I&#39;m real hot. In February I went to the hospital and 4 doctors looked at me, I stayed there one day overnight .  I kind of think that I was given the whole vial of the vaccine and want to know how long will it take for it to wear off, I watched them draw up the vaccine and they gave me everything in the vial. I think I got the whole vial.

I always have some discomfort of this knee, but the pain I experienced after the vaccine was much different.

                                                My mom received the Covid 19 vaccine on Jan 5, 2021 and became very about a week later. I was informed that she tested positive for Covid 19 on January 14th. One January 17th she became very tired and weak and would not eat. Hospice called me and told me that she was in a decline state. I saw her on January 25 and 26 and she was just sleeping and could not open her eyes. Her vitals were good and she seemed to understand when I talked to her - she would squeeze my hand and moan but she could not talk or open her eyes. My mom passed away on January 27, 2021 just 22 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She was very think to begin with and being to weak and tired  to eat resulted in her losing even more weight. Some of the other residents were given fluids to help and they recovered. My mom was not given fluids. I believe there were 20 deaths in her care home for the month of January when they vaccinated. This was an alarming number of deaths for the home. The facility had very few Covid deaths in 2019 and 2020. I asked every week if they had any Covid and or Covid deaths and this amount was shocking to me and the workers there.

An 83-year-old female consumer received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 13Jan2021 at 12:30-13:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (over the age, senior citizen). Lot number was EL8982. Medical history included diagnosed allergies, Compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity), high blood pressure, cholesterol. Concomitant medications included medicines for high blood pressure and cholesterol. Patient reported that she took suspect vaccine and for 4 days she felt fine but then in Jan2021 she developed a backache (just below the shoulder; it was really bad and very uncomfortable, on 17Jan or 18Jan, as reported), pain under arm, ache under arm pit (reportedly as worsening) and a rash from her elbow up. Patient thought after a couple days pain would be gone; it was just as bad as when it started. The patient received TYLENOL in Jan2021 and ongoing for pain, but it did not work. The patient did not visit emergency room or physician due to the events. The outcome of rash was unknown, the patient did not recover from other events.

                                                Sharp pain behind right knee.  Subsided by evening.  Went to The ER  Sunday morning, Feb. 21.  They x-rayed leg and found nothing  unusual for a woman my age.  Then they conducted a scan and discovered a blood clot behind my knee.  Since then, I have had intermittent pain. The Doctor referred me to a hematologist which I will see this week.  Prior to the vaccination have never had a blood clot.  It occurred three days after the vaccination.  Coincidence?  I think not.

                                                Patient received the injection approximately 1:27PM on Friday, February 26, 2021.  She felt fine until about 8PM Friday, Feb 26. At that time, she had feeling of malaise but did not check for fever.   She went to bed and fell asleep. Upon arising on Saturday, February 27, 2021, she felt feverish and had a backache.  Her fever was first checked about 11:30AM by her son and it was 101 degrees.  During the afternoon, about 3PM, she ran a higher fever (102 degrees).  The family consulted her primary care physician, who advised hydration and a Tylenol.  After talking with the physician, about 4pm,  the family gave her a 500 mg Tylenol, which brought the fever down to just under 100 degrees by 8pm Saturday night.  She also had aching legs at that time. but no longer had a backache. She slept Saturday night and awakened on Sunday, Feb 28, with a fever of 99 degrees.  Around Noon another Tylenol 500 mg tablet was administered.   During Sunday afternoon, the fever dropped to around 98.2 (Patient has a normal temperature of 97.3 or 97.4, well documented).   On Monday, March 1, 2021, at 11:00am, her temperature was normal, 97.4.  She said she still felt tired and her legs &#34;don&#39;t feel quite right&#34;.  However, our family feels she is doing much better and she has enough energy to do some of her normal activities and participate in conversation.

An 83 years old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 at age of 83 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hip surgery a few months ago and she was still kind of stiff and sore. Concomitant medications included lisinopril at low dose 10 mg once daily taken for blood pressure abnormal about 10 years ago; clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) taken for transient ischaemic attack from 2012 (she believed it was a around that time); acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN LOW) at low dose (she began taking this before the Lisinopril so it has been several years).The patient mentioned that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021 and everything was fine that day and the day after. At late in the day on 04Mar2021, she experienced a lot of problems which she mentioned was the worst experience in her life. She was 99% sure it was from the vaccine because she didn&#39;t experience anything like that before getting the vaccine. She mentioned that she experienced side effects all night like her heart beating really fast, a headache, a stiff neck, her nerves pounding all throughout her body, and a blood pressure of 174/78. She mentioned that it was the worst she&#39;s felt so far as compared to going to the ER, as she&#39;s experienced before. She did not go to the ER as she could not drive herself and she was living alone. She mentioned that she better the next day although it was not totally gone, she was a little shake and kind of weak. As of calling, she said that she was feeling okay and better than yesterday (07Mar2021) in which the effects were still present. She mentioned that it was horrible, very scary, she was very ill, very uncomfortable, really bad, and didn&#39;t want to go through that again. She didn&#39;t know if she would make it through the night. She was asking for what to do and asking if there needed to be an adjustment for her dose because she was a very small person. She didn&#39;t want to have the 2nd shot if she went through that again. It was the worst experience of her life. She was not sure what to do now about her second shot. She had the first shot 02Mar2021 and everything was fine, 03Mar2021 she was okay but on 04Mar2021 she had, by night time, she had a lot of scary things that had never happened to her before. Her heart was pounding she could hear it in her ears. Her head, her neck felt stiff and her head felt heavy, her whole body felt heavy and like the nerves in her whole body were just aggravated, it was hard to explain. She had ringing in her ears. Her blood pressure was 174/78 and she was just afraid to have the second shot, it was scary, it was really bad. She was wondering if the amount of the vaccine was too much for her.  She confirmed it was the evening 04Mar2021 when all this began. She said all of this was pretty well recovered at this point. She said the day after that happened, she was shaky but today (08Mar2021) she was fine. She did not know what it would be medications they are looking for but she was on normal medicine for old people she guesses. This was so bad that she really was not going to take the second dose unless they can tell her if she should or that they should give her less or something like that. The outcome of events was recovered in Mar2021.

The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine and 5 days later she got a terrible reaction. She did not expect it. She had a terrible reaction and thought she was going to die.

                                                Per husband: &#34;Wife developed severe chicken pox all over body. Wife got shock- for two days, she had sore shoulder, on the 3rd/4th day she starting developing rash on site where she got the shot. Then rash spread to her other side and now rash has spread all over the body. Thought it would go away in a day or two, but hasn&#39;t. She has had the rash for 8 days.&#34;   Further investigation on interview: It started approximately 3-4 hours after vaccination. First a sore arm then it felt itchy. She then noticed red raised spots. This rash has resolved slowly but &#34;almost back to normal&#34; as of Feb. 1. She still wants to get her second dose on Feb. 2 as scheduled.

Her joints were aching at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021.  She had a fever and not really chills, but she just never could get warm and was really cold at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021. She went to bed and woke up on that same date, 13Jan2021, and it started at 11pm.  She guessed it was disabling.  As it went on, it got better. By Friday, she was finally able to eat.

The fever only went on for a few days. Left arm was sore after injection and she had a lump and was itching 13Jan2021. It worried her.  The lump was still itching and sore, but was getting better. Reporter stated that the shingles vaccine did the exact same thing to her with the lump under her skin and itching.  It was given on her hip because she had small arm and they were scared to give it in her arm. The reporter wanted to know if there were elderly people in the trial and did any of them have COVID. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. Seriousness for In bed 2 days was reported as disabling. Seriousness for Could not eat, Fever and really cold was reported as not serious. Seriousness for Left arm sore after injection with lump and itching was reported as medically significant.

                                                Patient was brought in by ambulance on 01/28/2021 with complaints of fever, chills, myalgias, shakiness, and severe hypotension. Patient was treated for severe sepsis and acute kidney injury.  Patient was given fluid resuscitation, but unresponsive to treatment; NE&#43; vasopressin, hydrocortisone IV, along with empiric antibiotic regimen were initiated. Patient later on developed pulmonary edema, Non-ST elevation MI with no chest pain and new onset of cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45% and clean coronary arteries shown on cardiac catheterization. Physician suspected cytokine release syndrome related to the COVID vaccine and congestive heart failure. Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.  MD indicated vaccine reaction unlikely.

                                                The second dose was really  my first covid vaccine shot.  That evening for both, I started aching a lot in both arms and shoulders, couldn&#39;t sleep and extremely tired the next day.  The following day I was back to normal and the symptoms gone.  The second shot had a little stronger symptoms. I had covid in early November, 2020 in case that matters.    Also, I had a flu shot late October and had a severe reaction which led to my being diagnosed with covid.

                                                3/13/21 Ferrell ER to admission hpi: 84 y.o. female presented to the emergency room with complaints of back pain, nausea, and abdominal pain.  Patient approximately 1 week ago was bending over to pick something up and fell to the floor landing on her coccyx, and has had increased low back pain since that time.  Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.  Patient also had a urinalysis performed which shows negative for leukocytes, nitrate negative.

                                                left arm swelling, appeared within one hour of second vaccine dose. Swelling progressed with soreness of arm. Swelling worse day after. Started abating by Thursday 2/25/21 evening. Advised ice pack on arm, but pt. said it was too sore on day after dose given (Wednesday) to apply. Pt. took one aspirin on Wednesday morning. Advised her she could take a second later in the day. (Yesterday pt. stated she had taken a Tylenol. Today upon review she realized that she took an aspirin. Ibuprofen is also available. Advised pt. take an ibuprofen now over the phone as I waited. Taken at 8:13pm EST. No further medication taken on Wednesday. (Also encouraged ice pack on neck Wednesday for ongoing strong headache / neck pain yesterday. Pt. does not remember if she tried that. Head/neck pain resolved today.) Pt. states swelling today (Thursday) is mild-to-moderate, less than yesterday, but still noticeable. Doesn&#39;t hurt as much as it did yesterday, she says. She can now lift her arm without pain.

An 85-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021, 11:00 am as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension, stroke, heart attack, COVID-19 in Aug2020 (actually had COVID this summer in August, had the mild case), and emergency surgery in Aug2020. Concomitant medications included ajmaline (CARDIA), isosorbide, and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for cardiac disorder; and losartan. The patient her first dose on 04Feb2021 and experienced headaches, muscle aches and pains, chills, other flu-like symptoms, heart conditions, and sensitivity to eggs. She mentioned that this was normal and nothing unusual. She received her second dose on 25Feb2021 at 11:00 am. She was still kind of stiff but was okay. The next day on 26Feb2021 at 11:00 am, she noticed bright red bleeding in her urine when she emptied her bladder. After a few hours it faded. On the next day on 27Feb2021, she experienced the bright red bleeding in the urine again. The red blood did not hurt and patient was achy and headachy, &#34;you know muscles.&#34; So, that kind of happened and it just kind of eased off. She slept a lot because she felt tired and so rotten from Friday, Saturday, Sunday after getting the shot. She also had a mild low-grade fever, headaches, and body aches and pains which she considered normal. Patient was hard of hearing and did not have a bright red bleeding, just had a taint little bit till the day when she got it and then the next day, she went to the bathroom to empty her bladder again and had bright red bleeding again with some blood clots in it. Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry. She have never had that experience before so she was just not sure was that connected with that shot? She wanted to know if there were any other patients that have had that. Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs. Her urine seems to be clear as of the time of report. She wants to know if the bright red bleeding in the urine has been reported. Patient stated, &#34;I used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but now I am 5&#39;4&#34;. I think I am weighing about 158 now. I am sorry like I said because of my hearing and with a language difference a little bit. I was having a trouble hearing you.&#34; The patient did not have treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient (mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 12Jan2021 10:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for years; COVID-19 Virus from 23Apr2020 to an unknown date, patient was not on a vent or in the ICU but did receive plasma as part of her COVID-19 Virus treatment; ongoing cough. Caller&#39;s grandmother had Multiple Sclerosis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and had significant side effects. Patient weight was 175 lbs as provided by caller, who stated her mother recently moved into an independent living facility, and gained weight because the facility has a really good pastry chef. Patient height, reported her mother shrunk, and was 5&#39;5-1/2&#34;. Reported her mother couldn&#39;t walk after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was not able to walk the next morning, 13Jan2021. The caller stated she had to spend 3 days with her mother, after her mother received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021. Reported she thought initially what her mother was experiencing was either neurological or muscular. She said it was like her mother&#39;s brain wanted her to move, but her mother&#39;s legs wouldn&#39;t move. She said her mother needed to use a walker and have someone hold her from behind. She said now, at a week later, her mother still was not back to normal. She clarified her mother needed a walker to maneuver around, but didn&#39;t need someone holding her from behind. Reported she assumed her mother may have had tiredness, weakness, severe muscle weakness from receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She clarified if her mother wasn&#39;t able to walk after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, then what her mother had was the epitome of weakness, and the weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body. She said her mother had tremendous fatigue on days 2, 3, and 4 after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was able to function as of 19Jan2021, but her mother couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open during that time period. Reported her mother developed a congestive cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not continual, but persisting. She stated her mother said the cough was there before she had her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. The caller stated she disagreed with her mother. She said her mother has COPD, but her mother was not a cougher. She said her mother&#39;s cough now, reminded her of the cough her mother had when her mother had the COVID-19 Virus in 2020. She clarified her mother was tested on 23Apr2020 for the COVID-19 Virus, and diagnosed positive for the virus on 24Apr2020. The caller said she was perplexed by her mother&#39;s cough, and her mother will be seeing her doctor this Thursday, 21Jan2021. She said she gave her mother some Robitussin for the cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not persistent, but the cough was still there. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not constant, but her mother&#39;s cough was congested. She said she didn&#39;t know when her mother&#39;s cough started. She said she thought giving her mother the Robitussin doses was kind of insignificant, because her mother did not have a constant cough, where she needed to take the Robitussin. She said her mother didn&#39;t even use half of a normal sized Robitussin bottle. Caller stated she did not have the Robitussin UPC, Lot, and Expiration Date. Reported her mother has an annual lung x-ray and MRI, clarifying she believed her mother had both within the past 3 months. Reported her mother was concerned about receiving the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she told her mother that it was better to get the second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine than to get the COVID-19 Virus again. Reported her mother had asked her primary care doctor if she should get the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her doctor told her absolutely. She said her doctor told her she needed to take the COVID-19 Vaccine even if she had the plasma treatment with the COVID-19 Virus in Apr2020. Reported she planned to stay with her mother after her mother received the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t anticipate her mother having a reaction after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose because people said most reactions are happening after getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said now people are reporting having reactions after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported she thought her mother&#39;s side effect after having the COVID-19 Vaccine to be unusual, since most people say it feels like they have the flu, or they are tired, or they have a headache. Reported her mother not to be able to walk wasn&#39;t that her mother was not walking, but that her mother&#39;s foot wouldn&#39;t move. She said mother not walking was either neurologic or muscular, unless that is what extreme weakness is. She said she wondered if others have experienced what her mother has. She said if her mother was experiencing just extreme weakness, the extreme weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body, not in her upper body. She said her mother didn&#39;t have an appetite, but her mother was not too weak to put a spoon to her mouth. She said her mother couldn&#39;t move her legs, and her mother said her legs felt stiff, or almost frozen. She said if her mother had extreme weakness, and couldn&#39;t walk, what did that mean. She said if a person is really tired, the person can still move and get out of bed. She said her mother said she was really, really tired, and couldn&#39;t move. The caller said her mother said she couldn&#39;t move, and it took her mother 20 minutes to get her legs over the side of the bed. She said her mother not being able to move her legs could be extreme weakness, but observing her mother first hand, she said it looked like her mother not being able to move her legs was neurologic. She said her mother was strong in character and body, and her mother would do everything she could in her body to move, but it was like her mother&#39;s brain said &#34;go&#34;, and her body said &#34;not now&#34;. The outcome of the event Congestive cough was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 86-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 21Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

She got up and had a bowl of cereal. On an unspecified date, the patient also reported numbness in face, legs and slight headache, and need to eat all of a sudden or pass out, and these has gone on for five days now (at time of report).

The patient reported that after numbness and not eating, she had some ice cream and her whole chest froze up, and it felt like she was having a heart attack. Her chest felt like ice which never had happened before. It has been an effort to talk, she was really working hard to talk. The patient explained she got the vaccine 5 days ago (from the time of report) and reported she had muscle tightness around her whole face, she had a slight droop on the left lip, a slight headache right across the eye brows, her legs feel a little numb off and on, she got feeling of tiredness but that passes, she had the need to go eat suddenly or she will get very weak. The reason for the call was she was wondering if she should she go for the second vaccine when 5 days after having the vaccine she was experiencing numbness. Slight droop on the left lip started but never looked close until the time of report, not a lot but the lower lip on the left side it is slightly droopy, with slight headache right across the eye brows. Her legs felt a little numb off and on, and she stated that about 3 days after the vaccine, she was afraid to take a shower because her legs weren&#39;t steady enough. They are still that way at the time of report, but this did go away for a while on a day and she was able to take a shower. She also didn&#39;t feel well after the vaccine. On the day of the vaccine, she had a good dinner and felt good; but the next morning she was very weak and could only stay awake for very short amounts of time. She was in bed and couldn&#39;t stay up and this is not like her, she did not like to be in the bed. She got the feeling of tiredness but that passes and she can stay up for longer periods of time. She had to go eat or she gets very weak, she didn&#39;t feel like eating in the beginning. It was on the 4th day after the vaccine she would have to get a bowl of cereal all of a sudden or she would feel like she was going to pass out. She never had trouble with her stomach like this before where she felt the need to have to go and eat. She explained she never had trouble with stomach, she never had headaches, and never had a vaccine before. Muscle tightness around her whole face started 2 days after getting the vaccine and was getting worse. Her face felt really tight almost numb feeling. The outcome of the events was unknown.

We placed her in a wheelchair and she then said that her throat was closing up.  She said that it felt like someone was choking her.  A moment later, she felt like her jaws felt huge.  We quickly gave her about four or five large glasses of water  (one right after the other) and quickly took her blood pressure which went up to 170/80.  We then gave her one of her blood pressure pills.  After this, she started to finally feel better.

                                                Same day as when patient received the 2nd vaccine, she was overcome with generalized fatigue and nausea.  By the 4th day, her legs would not hold her when she tried to stand getting out of bed.  She was nauseous to the point of not being able to eat or drink.  Infact, she did not have the strength or desire to eat or drink.  By the 5th day post vaccine (02/20/21), I took her to the Emergency room because she was so fatigued, she just slept, and couldn&#39;t stay awake to eat or drink.  She was able to get to the car with a walker, but that was the last time she walked.  After time at hospital and then Skilled nursing, she passed away on 03/21/21.  She never regained the ability to toilet herself, eat on her own, failed to eat and drink, and eventually was put on hospice because she lost 30 pounds over the month from failure to eat or drink, even though I was there or the nurse was there to feed her every meal, and try to get her to take fluids.  Her fatigue was just overwhelming. When she first arrived at the emergency room, she: ? Presented with 2 days of weakness and AMS; fever, nausea  and generalized fatigue ?

                                                She got the vaccine, and had no problems until Wednesday 3/17/21 at 3:00 AM she started coughing and could not coughing.  She finally got up and went into the bathroom and by 3:30 had coughed up little round, clear jellyfish.  Then she stopped coughing and went back to bed for 15 minutes, and then at 3:45 started getting diarrhea which she had until 10:30 AM.   She called Pfizer and reported her reaction and talked to them. During that time she had a lot of diarrhea and her body was starting to ache, joints and muscles.  She did not take her temperature and went back to bed, and slept until she could get up and go to the bathroom.  She then took her temperature and it was 100.7, which her normal is 97. 3.  She slept from 11:00 PM Wednesday until 11:00 AM Thursday.  She could not stay awake for long  before falling back to sleep.  Yesterday she did sleep most all of the day, and did not eat anything since Tuesday evening and did have a piece of toast yesterday.  Today, 3/19/21 she is able to get up, dressed and gotten downstairs to get something to eat and has lost 6# in this time period.  She is feeling wimpy, and her temp is down to 97.3, her pulse ox is 98%, pulse in the 70s.  She&#39;s achy, and has rubbed on Aspercreme  and has taken Tylenol a couple of times.  She is still very weak, probably dehydrated and going to get something to eat as she has just gotten up.  She is foggy thinking, but feels that once she rests, eats and gets strength she will be fine.

This 89-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number PFREL1283, Expiration Date 30Apr2021), via intramuscular, on 15Jan2021 (at 12:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing lymphoedema (she gets water in her legs), ongoing severe arthritis of both knee caps (she had a cortisone shot and lidocaine in her knees), and dust allergy. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine received in Jan2020 and in Oct2020 (with terrible reaction: pain in arm, numb in arm and muscle pain arm for 6 weeks). Past drug history included allergy to lidocaine (her face swelled up), and hydrocortisone (CORTISONE). She was in a wheelchair. Surgical history included 2 hip replacements. Relevant concomitant medications included drug for lymphoedema. The patient stated she started having side effects almost immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. She felt very panicky, felt very weak, felt very tired. She had like a headache. Some of the symptoms started the day she got the shot and then more symptoms arose the day after. She was very tired and was sleeping a lot the next day. She felt very like groggy. In fact, she was so groggy, she pressed the wrong button in her chair. She clarified she has lymphedema and she has to be in a lift chair to keep her legs elevated. When she needs to get up, she presses a certain button to raise and lift the chair into a sitting position. However, that day, her doorbell rang (her meals are delivered to her) and she was so groggy and confused, that she pressed the button that put her straight out into a lying position instead of a sitting position. She ended up sliding off the chair and onto the floor. She had to call for assistance (there is an emergency button she can press). She had to be lifted off the floor. She explained to them she didn&#39;t end up on the floor from walking, she slid off the chair. She was so disoriented she pressed the wrong button. She felt like she had the flu, she was cold, she had the chills. She was laying down, covered up with 2 blankets. She couldn&#39;t move. It was terrible. At the time, she slid off the chair, she had to go the bathroom. She is on a water pill which makes things worse, but she has a bedside commode close to her lift chair. When she was trying to get off the chair go to the bathroom (which is only 4 or 5 steps away from the commode), she was so disoriented, she pressed the wrong button. She has had this chair for 5 years.  She slid off the chair and ended up hitting the floor with her rear end. She remained on the nice cold floor (its a ceramic tile floor) until they came to pick her up. She mentioned she has had 2 hip replacements and once she is on the floor, she can&#39;t get up. Once assistance from where she lives came to pick her up, she was asked if she need to go the hospital or call ambulance. She explained to them she didn&#39;t fall. She slid off the chair. She is a very active person. Although she is almost 90, year is not senile. She slid off the chair, she didn&#39;t fall. The patient stated that she got the flu shot this past October and had a terrible reaction to that, too. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her system. She has had a flu shot every single year for the past 10-15 years and she has never had a reaction at all. She received the regular flu shot at her doctor&#39;s office in Oct2020 had a terrible reaction, she had severe pain in her arm where they gave her the shot, the pain wasn&#39;t at the injection site, the shot was high up the arm, her arm was numb and she couldn&#39;t raise it; she had muscle problems with the arm, she had trouble with her arm for 6 weeks. She has been taking naproxen sodium (ALEVE) for the headache. She has just been treating it symptomatically. No fever and she has just felt cold. The patient stated she really is not sick. She went to pick up dog medicine from the vet and when she leaves her facility, her temperature is always checked when she comes back. She was told her temperature was 97 something. So, she wasn&#39;t running any temperature prior to the vaccine. The patient was planned for the second dose on 05Feb2021. The patient stated her symptoms are not so severe it affects her breathing or something serious. It&#39;s just a pain in her neck to walk around with a headache. The outcome of the events was unknown.
