As the day progressed I got chills, started running a fever, It went up to 104 and my heart rate went up and down from 120-165 so I went to the ER. They gave me  fluids and ran a whole bunch of test, tested me for Covid and Sepsis and everything came back normal and negative for Covid. They monitored my heart rate and once it started getting back to normal, they ended up letting me go home, I was there from 8pm to about 3am.  After that I felt tired and felt like when   I had Covid back in November.  I started feeling better about Sunday, still a little tired but felt more back to normal.  My heart rate is still getting back to normal so my Dr is following me on that.

                                                Woke up this morning with swollen, and extremely tender right armpit area. It is visually swollen compared to the left and is very painful. I am under the assumption this is likely a swollen lymph node post second vaccination. I have taken ibuprofen in attempt to help with pain and inflammation but does not seem to be helping much at this time. I anticipate this will improve over time.

Having upper back and neck pain and aching in right arm and spasms in right shoulder. Have used heat, nsaids, Tylenol, and muscle relaxers. May feel slightly improved today but not much. This could be coincidental but figured I should report in case others have experienced or will experience. I do not recall hurting my neck.

She noticed the pain and all other symptoms immediately when they were injecting it. She told the nurse who said she was tensing up. The events were considered medically significant by the patient. She also reported experiencing bone pain, unable to put in sutures at work.  She was taking 600mg Ibuprofen and 1000mg paracetamol (TYLENOL) every 6-8 hours. The events were not resolved. The pain had gotten worse. The other symptoms were persisting.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                shoulder injury following vaccination.  suspect SIRVA.  Extreme shoulder pain started a few hours after vaccination and developed loss of range of motion, weakness, inability to lift arm, tingling and numbness down the length of arm.  Severe pain prohibiting ADLs; needing assistance with every day functions.  Pain is incrementally improving but after 4 days still without recovery.   Suspect nurse placed too high, injecting into bursa instead of deltoid muscle. RN seemed concerned after injection. She also was not sitting during injection, increasing the likelihood of injecting too high.

Around 8:57, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and the left side of my tongue went numb.  A little later the left side of my face felt weird and the inside of my ear felt numb. It wasn&#39;t tingling, but it felt like I had a Novacaine shot (like when you get a filling at the dentist).   My neck got stiff and I was really tired.  The symptoms lasted about 4 hours.    When I woke up this morning the left side of my face and jaw still do not feel 100%.  My left eye is watery.  I&#39;m very tired.

This back pain continues today (1/26/2021).  On 1/21/2021, in the early hours of the morning, I woke to hives over my entire trunk, left arm (injection site), and left thigh.    *This subsided in maybe 10 or so hours with antihistamines.   On 1/23/2021, at approximately 1100, I felt heat in my left arm. This coincided with a heavy feeling in my left arm. When examined, I noted that my upper arm was slightly swollen, blotchy, and had a reddened rash approximately 4x4 inches. Minor itching.    *The swelling subsided by 1/25/2021, but the heat and reddened rash continues today (1/26/2021).

A 40-year-old female patient  received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EH9899), intramuscular in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 05:00 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with heart ablation. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Patient has no allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient also did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient experienced severe proximal myositis of upper and lower extremities also reported as proximal upper and lower muscle weakness on 21Dec2020 at 09:00. The patient also experienced dysautonomia on 21Dec2020. The patient was admitted to hospital for 4 days due to the reported events and was then released. Follow up evaluations and testing showed and confirmed vaccine related myositis. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department visit or urgent care and hospitalization. No treatment for the adverse events. The patient underwent lab test which included nasal Swab: negative on 23Dec2020. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported myositis, dysautonomia and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

A 40-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 08Jan2021 (11:00) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) on 18Dec2020 (02:45 PM) via an unspecified route (right arm) for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included drug allergy (reported as known allergies: Cephalosporin (mild reaction of hives one time after having taken it with no issues for years-pending clarification)). There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient reported that she woke up during the night after her second dose (dose given on Friday) with joint pain (around midnight or shortly after [09Jan2021, 12:15AM]). The entire day after her 2nd dose (during the day Saturday) every joint in her body ached and she experienced intense fatigue. There were also some muscle aches in her shoulders and her arm was sore at the injection site as it usually is after a tetanus shot (she stated she had soreness in her arm the day after the first injection but no other adverse events after the first injection). She did not seek medical treatment and did not take any over the counter medications to alleviate the symptoms as she does not typically take medications unless absolutely necessary. By the next day (Sunday), she was much better and had only slight joint pain remaining in her neck. By the following day (Monday;11Jan2021), all symptoms had resolved. She further stated that the symptoms experienced for one day did not make her regret getting the vaccine and she continue to strongly recommend the vaccine. The outcome of events was recovered on 11Jan2021. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.

A 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfa antibiotics. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took meperidine (DEMEROL) and experienced allergies. Within an hour of receiving the vaccine, the patient had a sharp intermittent pain in her left jugular/carotid neck area and felt a little &#34;tipsy&#34;. This continued for about one day. Then last week (approximately 28Dec2020), her upper left molar started aching (toothache). This subsided within about 2 days. Then on 30Dec2020, she developed a severe earache, which began to subside within about 2 days. Around 31Dec2020 through 04Jan2021, she had intermittent numbness and tingling in her left jaw area. Last night (05Jan2021), she developed a sharp pain on the back side of her left neck area. She went to the doctor on 04Jan2021, and no treatment was prescribed. She began self-medicating with an old prescription of prednisone on the evening of 04Jan2020 due to being fearful of developing Bell&#39;s Palsy. Most of her symptoms have now improved after beginning the prednisone. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering.

I went over to find the employee sitting in the person&#39;s office in a chair. She was able to tell me she received her first COVID vaccine approx 30 mins ago. She stated she stayed there for the 15 mins after the vaccine with no reaction. She is now having ringing in her ears, feeling lightheaded, hot, nauseaus, and &#34;I feel like I am in a cloud.&#34; She denies allergies or past hx of vaccine reactions. Denies hx of anaphylaxis. She denied any sob or chest pain. Employee was holding her head. She stated she had only had some coffee and juice today and was feeling hot. BP was taken and was 112/90 and she is not tachy and no resp distress observed. Patient was able to speak to me in full complete sentences initially. Another person came over and the employee was asked if she could stand and walk. Employee stated she felt she could stand and walk and when she did this she had to hold onto something to avoid falling and she was sat back down. Emergency services was called and employees speech was slow and almost slurred at times. Emergency services arrived and transported employee.

                                                I was exposed to Covid in November. I tested negative twice but had nerve pain along the right side of my face when my son had tested positive.  Both times I got the vaccination the nerve pain in my face came back.  It was fairly painful the second time. The concern is that I had an inflammatory response similar to when I actually may have had Covid both times.  It went away within 48 hours and I have been done since.

                                                Within 25 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my left arm became very heavy and there was a tingling/neuro sensation in left wrist/hand. A pressure began in the  anterior of my throat which increased gradually. I sought treatment in our Urgent Care just after noon that same day. The Provider monitored my vitals which were good and administered liquid Pepcid. Said Provider chose not to give Benadryl as I had taken Zyrec that morning for my allergies. I was discharged from the Urgent Care and went back to work at 1245. At 1730 hours, I had a slight headache above my right eye and extreme right-sided jaw pain with tooth sensitivity. These lasted for only 10 minutes. At 1830, the anterior and bilateral portions of my throat began to feel &#34;prickly&#34; and I developed a wheeze. I used an albuterol inhaler to relieve the wheeze successfully. At this time I also developed an itchiness throughout my whole body, worse on left side than right side. I took 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. At 0300, I took another dose of 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. I also took an itch pill/antihistamine of my husband&#39;s which provided no relief. At 0800, I took 20 mg of Zyrtec. At 1030, I took 100mg of Benadryl. I continued to use Benadryl throughout the day, every 4-5 hours.  At 1800, I had a fullness in my throat, a tightness in my chest and my left shoulder blade felt almost numb.  I also had a hoarse voice which passed by the next morning. The chest tightness was intermittent over the next day or two.  On Friday, the itchiness had improved some but was still prominent. I continued to use Zyrtec and Benadryl throughout the day. My Primary Doctor called in Prednisone if needed. By Saturday morning, I felt MUCH better. Today is Sunday and I am no longer itching and I feel so much better today.

                                                5 days after 2nd covid vaccine, I started experiencing severe pain, with pins/needles sensation.  Started in plantar aspect of both feet and traveled upwards to my hands, in a matter of hours.  Extreme pain in lower back and extremities caused me to go to the ER.  Following lumbar puncture and a series of diagnostic tests, I have started on IVIG for Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy.  This is a subtype of Guillain Barre syndrome, believed to be precipitated by autoimmune response generated from the 2nd covid vaccine.  I am now on day 4 of my hospitalization.

Took 50 hours to get out of bed and feel half normal.  Thought I was on the road to recovery when the arm pain started to increase.  No rash or swelling occurred at the sight.  It presents with pain more nerve like pain in my shoulder, elbow and radiated to fingers.  On Feb 5th the pain was so bad I went to see a shoulder specialist and are trying to figure out what is going on.  My right arm remains painful to move with nerve issues.  The specialist advise I report. In the meantime, I will follow up Monday with another specialist and also undergo some nerve testing.

As of 12/30 this has markedly improved and the tingling is intermittent. Later in the evening of 12/29 she noticed the onset of muscle pains throughout her body but especially in her feet. She also became very fatigued. These symptoms linger on 12/30. On 1/1 employee reports symptoms muscle soreness had resolved. 1/4 tingling in her fingers/arm has improved but is still present. She will follow-up with her PCP if this symptom persists beyond 2-4 weeks.

The day after: moderate to severe pain on the left arm that radiates to the neck and back. Took Ibuprofen in the morning. Pain was getting better as the day pass. At night, around 6 pm started to feel that something is not OK. I am not the same as before. My legs are not very strong (feeling it, not a problem that I can?t walk - it feels like). Feeling dizzy at times. Went to bed and pain on the left arm is much better. Two days after the vaccine: woke up with body aches, feeling dizzy at times, weak, nauseous. Not feeling OK. It is now around11:30 am  two day after the vaccine and I am starting to get worried. Please contact me for advise. Thanks

It steadily progressed, and by the morning of 12/25/20, I had almost no range of motion in my neck and right shoulder, and severe pain in my right shoulder/neck/upper back area (heat/ice/ibuprofen/Aleve/Tylenol offered zero relief) .  This lasted for a few days, then steadily improved until I returned to work on 12/28/20, where I had mild-moderate pain and most of my range of motion had returned.  I still feel like the muscles in my neck and shoulder are tight, but I?m doing stretching exercises with heat/ice at home and it seems to be working its way out.  The other symptoms were expected and mild:  fever, muscle/joint aches, fatigue.  These symptoms come and go ? I?ve had them since being COVID positive in March/2020.  Just to be extra safe, I was swabbed for COVID on the 30th and was negative.&#34;

I slept most of the day on Sunday after getting the shot the day before. I never checked my temperature to tell if I had a fever.  The night sweats continued into sunday night.   I took 600mg of advil for the body aches and went to bed.  When I woke up around 1:00 in the afternoon the body aches were gone and haven&#39;t returned.   Sunday night I was sweating most of the night and felt over heated until around 11:00 Monday morning.  I am always cold, I am the type who wears sweaters in the house all year long.  For me to be that hot in the house is very unusual.

Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), butalbital, caffeine, paracetamol (FIORICET 50-40- 325mg), dexamethasone 4mg Inj., diclofenac (VOLTAREN 1% Gel), Magnesium, valsartan (VASOFLEX) (pending confirmation), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12), losartan potassium. The patient was not pregnant and did not received any vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took cephalosporin and experienced allergy. On 24Dec2020, the patient experienced pain left side of the face and migraine, and came to emergency room where apparently they diagnosed facial paralysis. The events resulted in emergency room visit/ urgent care where the patient was administered dexamethasone 4mg Inj, Medrol dose pack, Vit B12 500mcg, and Fioricet 50-325-40. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. It was unknown if the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior or since the vaccination. The events were assessed by the nurse as non-serious. Outcome of the events was recovering at the time of the report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Could not do normal daily things without feeling wiped out . 3 Advil did nothing- sat 1/9.  Next day felt better.- sun 1/10.  That evening low grade fever 99.6 and achy again., mostly eyes and head.  Went to bed.  Monday okay. But noticed right armpit a pit puffy.- same side as injection.  Tuesday 1/12 woke up at 6:00am and had dull joint/bone pain bilaterally.  Ranging from neck ache, to sternum/upper back, shoulders, triceps.  Injection site still sore- slightly red off to the side.  Did some stretches in bed and eventually got up.  I am very in tune with my body- something is off.  I never wake up feeling ?bad?.  Fit, healthy and active normally.  Almost like a bad nights sleep with a poor mattress but only affected my upper body.  Took two Advil and hot shower- feel better but can tell something doesn?t feel right.

                                                While patient was receiving her second dose of the Pfizer brand Covid-19 vaccination (at 14:50), she mentioned to me that she had a sustained local reaction to her first dose.  Her arm had a hard, red, hot spot for approximately a week.  At this time I told her we would like her to stay under observation for 30  Min instead of the normal 15 min. At approximately 25 min post vaccination, the pt reported the following: &#34;arm felt heavy, both arms did, but more so the affected arm, instant headache, sore neck, vision went fuzzy, breathing wasn&#39;t difficult but felt labored, throat felt like it was closing/congested, rash on the inside of the affected arm&#34;.    Pt stated that her heart felt like it was &#34;pounding&#34;.    VS:  162/96, 99% RA, HR in the 70&#39;s.    Patient was administered 50ml IM diphenhydramine and monitored for 90 minutes in the clinic area.  Dr. was consulted and also spoke with the pt, advising her to continue with OTC diphenhydramine once at home.     The symptoms resolved after approximately 40 minutes.  By 17:00 the patient was deemed stable to go home with the instructions to go immediately to ED should any further Sx present.  It was verified that she did not live alone and would have someone with her that could assist.    Pt was subsequently followed up with a phone call on the next day by RN who relayed that she was very tired, but no other complications.

A 42-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose on 23Dec2020 h 09:00 intramuscularly in left deltoid (left arm) lot number: EK5730 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications were not provided. Patient stated that she has had double mastectomy, and missing a lot of lymph nodes, states she got the first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 23Dec2020, states it made her left subclavian lymph nodes swollen and hard. States that when she gets the flu vaccine at her hospital every year, she gets swollen lymph nodes ever since she had a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. She originally was wondering if she could get the vaccine in another large muscle group. States she even went as far as to cross reference flu shot ingredients with the Pfizer Covid ingredients to see if something in the vaccines were causing the swollen lymph nodes but was unable to come to any conclusion, the only think in common is the Sodium Chloride and she does not feel like that would cause any issue. States the swollen lymph nodes occurred after the Sanofi brand flu vaccine (no other information known or provided). Patient is on day 15 post vaccination and they are still swollen and hard, she is wondering if there is any data on how long this side effect can last. She made an appointment with her oncologist, she knows that the swollen lymph had the first dose, lymph nodes are still swollen and hard, knows it can cause swollen lymph nodes but wants to know what is the typically length of the event. Patient also experienced other side effects, on 30Dec2020 (last week), she developed vertigo that lasted through the weekend intermittently, states she at first thought she was having a stroke. States it seems to have subsided as of 05Jan2021 (yesterday). Patient also reported she had an itchy rash twice as part of her side effects reported from the COVID 19 vaccine. She noticed an itchy rash and it went away but she is unsure exactly the day or time. Stated she definitely remembered the rash on 28Dec2020 as she took pictures. It was gone in about three hours on the same day. She did not treat the rash because it was gone and not itching. The rash came and went and had not come back. It was mostly on the bends of the arms, bilateral arms. Patient reported developing swollen, tender, and hard lymph nodes under the Left subclavian area the day after the injection, on 24Dec2020. They were not as tender at the time of the report but were continuing and this was 15 days from her vaccination. Patient also experienced an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms that occurred twice and only lasted a few hours each time, onset date reported as 25Dec2020. She was advised to take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) for it however she did not take it. On 23Dec2020 patient experienced headache. On 24Dec2020 patient experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes and runny nose. On 30Dec2020 patient experienced joint pain and muscle and vertigo. The events headache, experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, runny nose, joint pain and muscle and an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms were considered serious as medically significant events. Patient had not recovered from swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, joint pain and muscle, extreme fatigue and swollen, tender, and hard lymph nodes under the Left subclavian area, she was recovering from headache, runny nose and vertigo and recovered completely from an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms on 28Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Causality between the events, headache, experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, runny nose, joint pain and muscle and an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms, and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine cannot be denied based on the reasonable temporal association.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

A 42-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, EL0140), intramuscular on 23Dec2020 08:00 at single dose at right arm for COVID-19 immunization; prednisone via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date (for 4 days) at 50 mg for an unspecified indication. Medical history included Known allergis: latex, contrast dye. Concomitant medication included the first dose of influenza vaccine (FLU) on 30Nov2020 at single dose at right arm for immunization. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. The patient received other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that Day 1: on 23Dec2020 08:15, the patient felt pressure behind her right eye after shot, felt in a fog, forgetful mid conversation. Day 2. (24Dec2020) Horrible headache started, fatigue. Day 3 (25Dec2020) brain zaps and brain buzzing began, headache, fatigue, numbness to right side of face to neck. By day 5 (27Dec2020) made its way to left side. Twitching of face when do certain movements. Her Dr gave her Prednisone and she took 50 mg for 4 days and stopped because she couldn&#39;t differentiate the tingling in hands and feet from shot or from that. Still brain zaps, newest issue sharp pain jolt behind eyes, left one in particular so bad she screamed and the nerves went all the way to finger tips. Her hand eye coordination was off as well and she wasn&#39;t able to be accurate on keyboard and her cursive was off. Whole body still weak, eyes hurt. Head a lot better than a day ago but still having buzzing and twitching. Today was day 18. She was awaiting an MRI with contrast on Friday hoping it got moved sooner as she was scared to what was going on. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse events included CT/MRI/Optic Nerve Scan/Pain Shot/Meds for Zaps. The events were non-serious per the reporter. Prior to vaccination, the patient wasn&#39;t diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 28Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for prednisone was permanently withdrawn on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of all these reported serious events might not be fully excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 20 min after receiving my Covid 19 vaccine, I left Hospital and began to feel numb in my throat, my lower face, and the tops of my shoulders. I had reduced sensation, but also felt as though I had no muscle control with movement. Examples of this are when I tried to flex my head forward as if in a nodding motion, or to elevate my shoulders like a shrug, or clench my jaw like when chewing. These were all extremely difficult and I felt as though I had no awareness of if I was even moving these parts of my body whatsoever when I tried to voluntarily do so. It was very strange and also upsetting. I also began to have blurred vision; it was difficult to focus or see properly, such as when you visit the eye doctor and they dilate your pupils and everything seems blurry and out of focus for a period of time afterwards. This all lasted for about exactly 1 hour post.  I did not seek medical attention for this as it did not worsen. I never had any difficulty breathing. It then completely went away.

I starting tasting metal in my mouth about an hour after the vaccine was given. Saturday 1/9, I woke up at 4am with left sided face numbness from my forehead to the middle of my neck. I also had a headache and some right arm pain at the site of the vaccine. These symptoms continued through Monday 1/11 when I reported to the Emergency Room at. I had a CT scan completed and release with negative results. I had a COVID test completed on Tuesday 1/12. I had an MRI on Wed 1/13 with negative results. I seen my primary physician on Thursday 1/14 as a follow-up. I was informed that I had a reaction to the vaccine and that my symptoms would properly last for 2-3 weeks, marked as Bells Palsy and put on prednisone.

At minute 45 after shot, I began to feel light tingling under my skin near the injection site, which slowly progressed to my elbow then my shoulder then my wrist, then to my neck and chin (all on left side) at which point I asked the HCP who gave the shot if I should take an antihistamine, she asked me if I was having trouble breathing and I said no, she recommended I take 500 mg of Benadryl 3x every 8 hrs. I took the dose about 75 min after my shot, by which time I felt tingling in my foot and pain in my wrist, slight feverishness. Fell asleep, woke up 4.5 hrs after the shot. The tingling sensation was gone. Only some drowsiness and pain in my arm. Applied ice pack to arm, took 250 mg Benadryl at 9.5 hrs after shot and woke up next morning with negligible symptoms, mild arm pain.

Pain at injection site started first at around 4pm on the day of the 2nd dose(Th). I woke the next morning (Fri) with arm pain and a little tired. Later that day around 4pm the fatigue, chills and fever started. Fever hit 101.5F overnight and then the fever broke by the morning (Sat). I felt a little tired on Sat, but all that remained as pain, redness and the feeling of a knot at the injection site (improved from Fri). Today (Mon) the knot still remains and the pain is gone. Slight pink around injection site, but much better.

A 42-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose at left upper arm for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The first dose of the vaccine BNT162B2 was administered on 19Dec2020 at 42 years old.  Caller stated she received the 2nd dose yesterday of the covid vaccine and experienced shoulder and joint pain, and this morning she has stiffness in joints and shoulder. The patient reported that last night, her shoulder joint started hurting but it was mild. This morning, it is very painful. Caller was looking at where the medication was injected on her, and she thinks the product may have been injection too high on her arm, like it was directly under the acromion process, and she is concerned the product may have been injected directly into her shoulder joint, instead of into the muscle. She thinks that injection was given to her too high, it may went to the joint not the muscle. Caller confirmed that she had no other vaccines on the same day as her COVID vaccine. The outcome of the event shoulder and joint pain was unknown while not recovered for the other events.   Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

That did not subside until 4 days later. Day 5 it still hurt but was getting better. She reports she is still not sleeping well at night. She said she can barely put her sports bra on or pull up her pants without it hurting. She did try Motrin, and it helped with the throbbing pain but not with her range of motion. Ice does help a little bit.

                                                Patient reports that she received dose one of the Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccine last Friday, February 5, 2021 at 2:03 PM.  She received this here at facility campus vaccine clinic.  She felt a strange tingling sensation immediately upon receiving the injection that extended from the injection site across her upper back but otherwise tolerated the injection well.  Because of her history of food allergy she was advised to remain at the vaccination clinic for 30 minutes.  During that 30-minute wait period she felt generally well however began to develop pruritus at her back in the legs.  She did not mention this to the staff at the vaccine clinic and did not look at her skin.  The pruritus was not too bothersome and she left the vaccine area after 30 minutes and walked down to our clinic to return to work.  Her pruritus intensified very quickly upon returning to her desk and within a few minutes of after her return she went into the bathroom to look at her back and had patches of red, raised, urticarial lesions across her back.  She began to feel itchy all over her body.  She remained at work and did not take any medication or seek any medical help.  She did not look at her legs.  The pruritus intensified and when she looked at her skin of her legs approximately 1 or 2 hours later she had developed urticaria essentially head to toe.  She had large confluent patches of urticaria at bilateral thighs, urticaria at her face, trunk, arms, legs.   At this point she felt otherwise well.  She went home and took 10 mg of Claritin and applied a topical Benadryl cream to her skin.  This was not helpful.  She had severe pruritus of her eyes and eyelids.  She took 50 mg of oral Benadryl which also was not particularly helpful.  Sometime in the middle of the night that night she developed chills, felt feverish, and developed intense muscle and joint aches.  She took an unknown dose of ibuprofen with minimal improvement in muscle and joint pain.  She did have improvement in fever.  Following day was Saturday, she spent the whole day in bed in extreme pain.  She describes the pain at her wrists as feeling as though &#34;somebody was breaking my bones&#34; with any movement of her wrists.  She had pain even laying flat in her bed and had severe pain at all of her joints with movement.  She tried taking a flexeril with no improvement. She recalls a T-max of 102 sometime on Saturday or Sunday.  At that time she had been taking ibuprofen around-the-clock.  She also took 10 mg of Claritin approximately every 4 hours.  Each night she also took 50 mg of Benadryl.  She continued to experience urticarial skin rash and intense pruritus of the skin.  The urticaria waxed and waned during this time.  She also developed a fever blister at her lower lip. She spent most of Sunday in bed also.  She was feeling a bit better by Monday however still had intense pruritus.  Skin rash was much improved at most of her body however she still had mild urticaria at her face.  She did not have a fever on Monday but was continuing to take ibuprofen around-the-clock.  She discontinued ibuprofen yesterday and has not had fevers or chills since Sunday.  At this point her urticaria has essentially resolved. She continues taking claritin 10mg BID to 3 times a day and also 50mg bendaryl at bedtime.    She did not experience any bruising related to this rash however did have excoriation from scratching particularly at her face.   Throughout the course of these days she did not have any episodes of angioedema of the lips, tongue.  She denies difficulty breathing, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, throat tightening, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope.   She has a history of oral allergy syndrome with peanut.  Promethazine has caused diplopia, weakness.  Simvastatin caused muscle weakness.  She has never had any issues with vaccines.  She has been getting a flu shot yearly with no difficulty.  Her most recent vaccine was October 8, 2020, quadrivalent influenza vaccine.   No known history of allergy to polyethylene glycol.   No history of chronic urticaria.  She takes NSAIDs frequently without any difficulty.  She has not taken any NSAIDs prior to receiving this injection or developing this urticaria.  She had however taken 10 mg of Claritin prior to receiving this injection.   She has no history of anaphylaxis.  She has undergone surgery under general anesthesia on more than one occasion without issue.  No history of reaction to stinging insect venom.  She receives immunotherapy for inhaled environmental allergens here in our office and has done well with this.   She denies any recent medication changes or new over-the-counter medications.   She has not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19.

A 43-yearsold female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.

She suspected that she had an undiagnosed autoimmune disease. She was inquiring about duration of the reported AE&#39;s from clinical trials, and tried to decide how long she will feel this way. And going on 10 days and she&#39;s just struggling, bad headache and neck pain headache worse at night time, sometimes gets better during the day. Terrible pain and nausea. Any info on length of side effects: 36 hours- body aches feeling crappy. Low grade fever. Nausea with the spinal pain, pressure in the head. Difference in people with autoimmune issues- infertility - suspected autoimmune. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, there is no biological plausibility to implicate the suspect vaccine to the occurrence of the serious event autoimmune disease.

On 1218 2021, I developed shooting pain down my right leg.  Later that evening I developed persistent tingling and numbness in my hands, both, as well as tingling and numbness in both my feet. Since that time I have had persistent tingling and numbness. These symptoms have persisted since this time. They are worse with cold weather. Not associated with any weakness however I do have some increased fatigue ability in my right forearm, which may be unrelated.

A 43-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) at a single dose on 28Dec2020 at 13:30 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had recently diagnosed with Covid-19 and &#34;recover/off quarantine&#34; on 12Dec2020. Concomitant medications were not reported. After vaccination, the patient experienced extremely high heart rate (142bpm), muscle aches, chills, O2 saturation dropped to 97%. The patient did seek medication attention/went to ER. She had to miss work. High heart rate resolved on the same day and other events resolved after 48 hours. The patient stated that she believed she took it too soon because she still had the antibodies from Covid, the doctors were saying they were not sure it was from vaccine, but she was sure it was. The patient made up her mind to not take the 2nd dose as she was scared. She stated that she did not want to go through that again, she could have had cardiac arrest.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I received the vaccine on Friday evening at 6:45 p.m. . Starting early morning on Saturday around 3:00 in the morning I begin to have extreme body aches causing me to wake up and my whole body was aching and I was shivering and it was difficult to move my right arm, which is the arm that took the injection. I was barely able to prop myself up to take Advil. I was down for the rest of the weekend in bed in pain. On Sunday the 10th of January the pain was less but it was more focused as a headache and I was extremely fatigued and slept the whole weekend.

By the time I got back into my house, I had tunnel vision and could not see directly in front of me. I went to lay down, but ran into a piece of furniture because I was so disoriented and hit my shin on it. I collapsed on my bed. I stayed there for  few hours and then I was ok. I had severe, flu-like symptoms for most of the day - fever, chills, low energy, joint pain (specifically back and hip) - that waxed and waned. I finally felt almost back to normal approximately 50 hours after the injection.

                                                I had had minor intermittent teeth pain off and on for several weeks. With in a day of getting the vaccine the pain began increasing to the whole left side of my face and neck and increasing in intensity. I was unable to sleep 12/24 and 12/25 and ended up going to urgent care on 12/26. Despite not having sinus fullness/drainage they diagnosed it a sinus infection and gave me antibiotics. At the end of the 5 day course my symptoms had improved some but were not gone and I was still requiring frequent Tylenol for pain so the course of antibiotics were extended. I do not know if this was caused by the vaccine, but it coincided with the vaccine.

I received first dose on 12/23/2020 and second dose on  1/10/2021.  Since vaccine I?ve noticed my reflux has been flared.  I haven?t had to take Protonix in months; however, I really started to experience indigestion and chest burning/pressure a week after first dose.  I started back taking Protonix and had to increase dose to twice a day on 1/5/2021.  Symptoms have improved significantly but it?s still somewhat aggravated. I also experienced lower back pain and upper and lower extremities numbness/tingling maybe 2-3 time since first vaccine

                                                The night after the injection, I was very lethargic, my mind was &#34;cloudy&#34; I couldn&#39;t form coherent sentences.  Took Tyelenol before bed because my arm was very sore.  Next morning, my whole body ached and had a severe tension headache, my jaw was very tense also.  I was still very lethargic and my mind still &#34;cloudy&#34;.  Took Tylenol again after dinner, that night I started to feel relief from aches, headache and my mind can think more clearly.

That afternoon I felt L hip pinching pains and joints pain. A week later I had sudden vertigo , unable to walk normally with no tinnitus or loss of hearing . I took meclizine 50 mg and it helped. It?s already day 5 , vertigo has subsided , I still don?t feel myself but I am able to go around, drive and move. I only feel dizzy at times and feel vertigo when laying down

A 43-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# either GL0140 or EL0140, Expiry date and NDC number were not written), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  There were no medical history and concomitant medications. Patient pregnant: No. She has had No positive test for covid before the vaccine, and No Antibody test before the vaccine either. She has had No issues with vaccines in the past. The patient had the vaccine on 23Dec2020 and then on 01Jan2021 she began to experience eye twitching and it hasn&#39;t gone away and it&#39;s very bothersome. It&#39;s still happening. Her first dose was on 23Dec2020. The eye twitching began on 01Jan2021, it&#39;s just the left eye, she can see the eye lid moving when it twitches, she felt it, like the eyeball itself was twitching or spasming. There were no issues with the vision in that eye. She did feel she was getting sleep, she was conscious about seeing if she was tired, both eyes felt as if she had cried for a long time but she had not cried at all and the eye that was twitching she felt it more in. She thought it was getting better in the morning because at that time she didn&#39;t feel it, but by mid-afternoon it was consistent. The twitching happened often sporadically every couple of minutes, and she was annoyed of it. Investigation Assessment: No. The outcome of the event left eye twitching was not recovered, outcome of other events was unknown.

A 43-year-old female patient received one dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249) via unspecified route single dose for protection from COVID-19 2 o&#39; clock or 3 yesterday (09Jan2020), at 43-year-old. Medical history included: multiple sclerosis. Concomitant medication included: sertraline 50 mg once daily at night; antidepressant (unspecified). The patient previously took glatiramer acetate (COPAXONE) once for multiple sclerosis and amantadine, was allergic to both. The patient didn&#39;t notice soreness on the side of her face, was probably from the vaccine started yesterday (09Jan2020). The patient was doing fine but then noticing was getting swelling in her lymph nodes on the right side. The patient did not notice the swelling, but she noticed the discomfort first last night (09Jan2020), &#39;9th, 10 pm&#39; (not clarified further). The patient thought that it was a &#39;pimple&#39; (not further clarified) there. And then later today (10Jan2020), or just maybe an hour ago, when she felt that on her neck, she found lymph nodes swollen. So far, no treatment was taken. No lab work done. Action taken for BNT162B2 was not applicable. Outcome of the events was resolved.

A 43-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical Vaccine included received first dose of BNT162B2 on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization and her arm was inflamed, and so swollen, she couldn&#39;t move it. Caller was instructed to call after getting the COVID vaccine. She had a reaction after the vaccine. Her doctor said to call Pfizer. It was after she received the 2nd dose of the vaccine, Saturday (09Jan2021). She had a reaction. She developed a headache and fatigue. She had had these side effects since Saturday. They have lasted Sunday, Monday, and today/Tuesday. She was very tired, and she has generalized body pain. The pain was in her arm, shoulders, knees, spines, scapula&#39;s, hips, hands, legs, feet, and back. Literally, her whole body was so painful. She had been taken Ibuprofen 800mg and Tylenol 1g. She had been taking those every 8 hours. She took them together. When she took them, her headache and body pain was maybe a 5-6/10. If she didn&#39;t take the Ibuprofen and Tylenol her body pain and headache was probably an 8/10 pain. She also had swollen lymph nodes in her left arm pit. Which is the arm they injected the vaccine into. She just noticed it Saturday night. She couldn&#39;t move her arm. Now, after the second, she had a swollen lymph node the size of a quarter. It had been the same size since Saturday. She was wondering if it would go away? She was also becoming forgetful. Her brain was foggy-ongoing. Like she forgot her doctors appointment today. The outcome of event &#34;brain was foggy&#34; was not resolved while outcome of other events were unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Around 11:30pm 1/25, I muttered &#34;I don&#39;t feel good,&#34; which reminded me of being a child getting sick. within 30 minutes of then end escalating over the next hour, I had a severe headache, bilateral, occipital, pressure in entire head and neck. The headache as also in my eyes and in my ears.  Back was also painful - not as bad as neck, but i can&#39;t explain how horribly a hope a massage could fix me.  There was no comfortable position to alleviate any of that.  I also got the chills, constantly, suddenly switching from shivering cold to so hot i needed to take blankets off - but soon as i took the blankets off I&#39;d be freezing cold again. I was also super nauseous, though i didn&#39;t vomit. I pretty much couldn&#39;t get out of bed much for 24-36 hours. During that time, i was unable to sleep as well, i think mostly due to the chills, constantly having to move about to keep warm or cool off, but not sure.      I did take acetaminophen around 10pm 1/26 (36 hours after injection)- i felt like I knew you&#39;re not supposed to, but I couldn&#39;t take it any more and it might have less anti-inflammatory impact than ibuprofen.  It dulled the pains some, but didn&#39;t make it stop. the chills and nausea mostly stopped and was able to sleep more the second night, last night.       I&#39;m now up and trying to work today (1/27). Head still has pressure headache throughout. Neck is still sore, like a pressure headache. I feel generally foggy and heavy.

A 43 years old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EL3248, Expiration Date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 at 13:22 at single dose on right arm for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included vasovagal (she did have a history of vasovagal. She talked to her doctor about this prior to the vaccine. At first when she had it her previous doctor felt a little confused. She was unsure if it was vasovagal or a blood clot in her lungs. She did get it checked out with a cat scan and there was no clot. They had to have tested her for anaphylaxis at that time. It was not a clear diagnose. Then she saw a cardiologist. She was diagnosed with vasovagal at that time. It lasted only a few months and she was fully recovered). Concomitant medications included ongoing ergocalciferol (VIT D) and ongoing vitamins NOS (MULTIVITAMIN). Patient received the vaccine on Tuesday, 12Jan2021. Her appointment was at 12:54, but she got the vaccine at 13:22. She was looking at her phone to re-schedule her second dose. She felt totally fine. At 13:27 she had this weird very hot rush down her right arm that was vaccinated and went up the back of her neck only on the right side. She looked up from her phone and was very dizzy. She stood up and as she did her heart started to race. It was a really weird feeling that she has never felt. She was a little out of it. She had no trouble breathing. Within 30 seconds she was completely fine. She did feel a little out of it, as it produced a little bit of anxiety. She had no other symptoms. She stayed at the facility for 30 minutes. As she was leaving one person asked how she felt and she was told to let the EMTs know. She let them know what happened. One woman working there said it could have been an anxiety attack. She did not have a lot of anxiety but she did have some. It did not feel like that. She had never had the warm sensations or heart racing. She was totally fine when talking to the EMTs. They did not seem concerned and they let her schedule her second shot. She read on Pfizer about allergic reactions. She was assuming this was what happened. A mild allergic reaction. She had no breathing issues or hives. Her arm was very sore- it was difficult to lift it. She had also never had this type of soreness with vaccines. Dizziness: She has had the dizziness a couple of times. Twice now. One when she had gotten home. It was very mild and nothing compared to what she had when she got the vaccine. Then another last night at bedtime. It was a woosh of dizziness.  Arm soreness: very improved now. felt like she would normally have after getting a vaccine. The first day was intense but after a few hours was less. The next day she woke up and it was pretty much gone. She still had a little but it has mostly improved. Caller stated she would still like to get the second dose but she was a little nervous. She had it maybe once or twice since then and it has been mild with no extreme pressure drops. They thought maybe it was a virus that affected her. Her reaction to the vaccine was different. The difference was pretty significant. Vasovagal felt like her heart will stop and she will pass out. After the vaccine she felt dizzy but didn&#39;t feel faint, and had a racing heart. Nobody seemed concerned about her reaction and getting the second dose. But she read that Pfizer does not recommend getting the second dose even if you had a mild reaction. She was wondering what she should do. Her second dose is scheduled for 02Feb2021. Outcome of hot sensation/weird very hot rush down her right arm that was vaccinated and went up the back of her neck only on the right side and heart racing was resolved on 12Jan2021, dizzy was resolved on 13Jan2021, outcome of anxiety was unknown, outcome of her arm was very sore- it was difficult to lift it  and a mild allergic reaction was resolving.

This happened a second time and then it was finished. I felt really tired and not myself.  Then later that night my arm began to hurt so bad that I could not lift it. I began to rub the area that was hurting and noticed that I now had a nice size lump there . I took a Tylenol 500mg and a hot shower. When I woke up the next morning my arm was still hurting but not as bad. When I went to use the bathroom I had began to start spotting again. This continued throughout the day and now I am bleeding as if I was having my period. I am super tired. It is to the point that i cant function at work.

                                                Starting on February 24, 2021, I started to have shortness of breath. This slowly got worse until on March 2, 2021 I was unable to breathe in all the way and was getting a sharp pain in my side/back when I tried to breathe in more than half way. I then went to the emergency room recognizing the symptom as likely being a pulmonary embolism, as I had experienced one four years earlier. It was, in fact, a PE. I was in the hospital for five days as they treated the clots with blood thinners. I slowly got my breathing more back to normal and was discharged. They are still runnying myriad tests to try to determine the cause or causes, but I thought it wise to report here in case the vaccine is a factor. I received my second dose on 2/26/21, a few days before I went to the hospital but my symptoms started a few days before that.

Knees continued to swell with limited motion, discomfort on bending, no point tenderness, and a negative meniscal exam. Swelling was worse on the left. X-ray normal. Worsening symptoms continued that limited standing and walking. Labs done on 2/2/2021 came back positive for Lyme disease and reactive arthritis. Swelling initially improved when patient was put on doxycycline, but worsened significantly after physical use. MRI showed large effusion in the left knee consistent with Lyme and a small focal lateral posterior horn meniscal tear not consistent with effusion. Effusion was drained March 1st and was PCR positive for spirochetes. WBC in effusion was 3400. Patient switched to amoxicillin and knee showed improvement by March 12th, 2021.

The feeling of heaviness continued, but I was able to walk and completed my daily activities. My right arm felt painful similar to receiving a tetanus shot, I took some Tylenol and drank some coffee and felt better. However, the feeling of heaviness in my legs continued. On Sunday, my left leg continued to swell and I noticed that the area under my knee cap and above the upper part of the rim of my socks was visible swollen, red, and painful.  I took some Motrin and the swelling improved. Later, I noticed I am having musculoskeletal pain and general body aches that improve with Mortin but returns. I am able to continue with my ADLs

I started feeling down. That night, I went home and had chills and fever. I was sweating in my sleep. I was fine on Christmas and now I have bronchitis like symptoms. I&#39;ve seen 3 different providers at urgent care and was told that they don&#39;t know much about the vaccine. They told me to use Albuterol and go to the hospital if I get worse. I was told that I still have the antibodies from already having COVID twice and it may be causing me to have problems now. The first time was really bad and I developed pneumonia, but didn&#39;t go to the hospital due to all of the deaths occurring in city.

The patient received minor relief with the steroids and NSAIDs after 2 days she took a gabapentin (NEURONTIN) which was given to me by a family member. The gabapentin had given the most benefit. On day 4, the patient continue to have a full nagging pain and the muscles of her arm are fatigued from constant tension. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of the events was unknown. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Driving home 18-20 mins post injection, my heart started racing, my hands were shaking, it became hard to breathe, my fingers were tingling and my mouth got very dry. I pulled over and called 911. The paramedics stated my BP was within normal limits of around 140/80. My normal is closer to 90/65. Once symptoms resolved I attempted to drive home. Once again, the same symptoms returned. I pulled over. I then made my way to a safe location and waited for family to come. Since the event I have had times of mild labored breathing while walking. While driving I become very anxious and the feelings of an anxiety attack return. I saw my nurse practitioner 2 days ago who referred to the driving anxiety as a form of PTSD and prescribed Prozac and Xanax. I have not take the Xanax, but have taken two nighttime doses of Prozac. Yesterday, I did not feel as though I had taken medication. My drive to work was uneventful. My drive home involved tightening of the chest, labored breathing and anxiety. This morning I cannot tell if I am feeling the vaccine or Prozac in my system, but I feel off. Swimmy headed, watery mouth, heaviness in my arms and shoulders. I need guidance on taking the 2nd vaccine or if I should seek further medical treatment. I have added a vit B vitamin a day to my regimen since the date of the vaccine.

Then, I started to feel kind of lightheaded and my legs were weak. I let the staff know and they offered me benadryl but I declined. I waited about 35 minutes then I went home. I continued to feel lightheaded and weak for about 4 hours and I also began to fill nauseous. My arm continued to be sore for a few days and I ran a fever of around 100 from the following day 1/9 and I am still running a fever now on 1/12.

On the 29th I was given a COVID-19 test which came back positive. I noticed when I lay flat I cough alot but when I prop myself up I dont.

It helps with the fever and also for the headache. 1/9/2021 woke up at 4:00 am with vertigo plus the above side effects. In addition to the Tylenol, I had taken dramamine in the morning and had been taking Meclizine 25-50 mg for the dizziness/vertigo. I also had done epley maneuver to help get rid of the vertigo since I am more dizzy turning on my right side and thinks that it is positional vertigo. 1/13/2021 still dizzy and taking Meclizine because it helps for the dizziness. I don&#39;t have anymore fever, the pain at the injection site is now mild, still moderate pain for the headache, some body aches but not as much as before. I had gone to the urgent care at this point to be seen since the vertigo is still there since Saturday 1/9 and it is now Wednesday 1/13. The doctor at the urgent care told me to continue taking Meclizine, hydrate and rest for a total of one week since the onset of the vertigo.

                                                2nd shot: Very different experience. Got the shot in my left arm after work like before. I had a headache and felt tired so took some melatonin, had a hot toddy, and went to bed early. Woke up roughly 18 hours post vaccine with back aches and lower rib pain when I took a breath. Took my temp, it was 100*.  By 21 hours I had a temp of 102*.  My groin, neck, and left arm pit lymph nodes were enlarged as well. After sleeping most of the day away, it felt like my fever &#39;broke&#39; at 28 hours, it came down to 101*.  Finally I took some Tylenol at 34 hours so I could sleep from the back pain.  Woke up the next morning at 45 hours with a stiff back/neck but temp down to 99*.  I also had a swollen and reddened entire deltoid where the shot had been given (painless when shot given and no blood after), almost like a cellulitis or allergic reaction.  My left armpit lymph node remains enlarged but not as painful. Now almost 72 hours out, the only residual effects are a decreasing but enlarged left armpit lymph node, improving swollen/reddened deltoid, decreased appetite, and decreased energy level.

I had pain in the wrist arm, joints and fingers. I determined it was due to the swelling.  I had some lymph node enlargement, and was really fatigue and slept most of the day. (36 hours).  I did not have a fever.  I&#39;m a doctor and did some evaluations  on myself. I didn&#39;t have trouble breathing of swallowing.  If I wasn&#39;t medically trained I would have gone into the doctor.  I did see an ENT for hearing test to make sure there was no damage and there was not.

This 44-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: E19266) via intramuscular at single dose on 20Feb2021 09:30 for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was on 30Jan2021 in left arm. Medical history included splenectomy from Feb2017; pancreatic surgery from Feb2017, they removed her spleen as part of that; soy allergy; poultry allergy. Patient confirmed she had splenectomy. The surgery was sort of emergency based so knowing most likely they were taking her spleen out; she was given 4 vaccinations. In the hospital, she did break out in what appeared to be like a chicken pox type rash. The rash lasted a month and then it started to fade. She did not have any breathing sort of symptoms. The doctors did attribute the rash to one of the vaccinations, she was not clear on what vaccine caused the reaction. Ideally, she was supposed to have 2 weeks prior to the surgery so her body had time to reabsorb but she did not have that kind of time, but she had nothing internally going on. She confirmed she had no names, NDC, Lot number or expiration dates for the vaccines she received at that point in time. Having the splenectomy was the biggest thing. In the past, she did not have any allergies to medications, but did have allergies to soy and poultry. She did break out from certain food and her skin develops those blotches. She did have an extra work up in Feb2020, where they tested a bunch of food sensitivities and allergies, and nothing came back. This was right before COVID hit so she did not really follow back up after that, but she was tested for all major foods and household things and nothing came up. In her late 20&#39;s, she definitely tested for a soy allergy and allergy to poultry. She did check off yes, she had a reaction previously when she was filling out the form at the COVID-19 vaccine site knowing that she had this prior experience. She was held 30 minutes each time for that reason. Concomitant medication was none. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was no. On 20Feb2021, patient was very faint, thought she was going to pass out, eyes were watering, blotches on her neck and chest, tingly experience on her tongue and lips, severely shaking, overwhelming chills, extreme nausea. On an unspecified date, patient experienced headache, general weakness, in her legs especially, no energy, no appetite, chills that come and go, diarrhea and green colored stools. Patient received her second shot of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine on 20Feb2021. She had had symptoms ever since. She had a reaction on site at the vaccine center. She eventually had to go to the Emergency Room by ambulance. Her symptoms were still going on and tomorrow would mark a week since she received the second dose. The symptoms she experienced on site were different than what she was currently experiencing. She felt like she had a true reaction at the vaccine facility site. Within 6 minutes of receiving the second vaccine, she became very faint, her eyes were watering. She thought she was going to pass out for a bit. She was told she had blotches on her neck and chest. She had a tingly experience on her tongue and lips. She was severely shaking and had overwhelming chills. She stated this happened for a couple of hours. Basically, there were 3 waves of these symptoms kind of happening. The third wave happened probably a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. At that point, she had been given two pills of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), taken orally. With the third wave, she thought she was going to pass out, which she thought multiple times before, but then with this particular wave, she experienced extreme nausea which was kind of a new symptom. The doctor on site said to the EMT that he wanted her to go to the Emergency Room. Patient confirmed she was taken to the ER via ambulance the day she received the vaccine, 20Feb2021. She was never admitted into the hospital; she was only seen in the Emergency Room for a couple of hours. She was given IV fluids, she had blood work done. She didn&#39;t have a copy of her labs but she was told they were okay. She was injected with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) via IV before she was released. A lot more symptoms came after she was released from the hospital (ER). She came home and she had just a crazy headache that she really woke up with every single day until this morning. She had been taking a lot of caffeine/paracetamol (EXCEDRIN, Lot#: H044G, Expiry Date: Jun2022) for her headaches. She experienced extreme weakness, nausea. She clarified she had weakness in her legs. She had this exhaustion, and she felt this general weakness sort of in her legs especially. She was still taking stuff for a headache, and she was taking nausea pills. She had been out of work all week. She had no energy, no appetite really. She had chills that come and go. She had diarrhea. She clarified she had more diarrhea in the beginning days after receiving the vaccine, but it was always been a green colored stool as well. The ER called and checked in and were very surprised she had been having the symptoms still so severely. They wanted her to go get an actual COVID test. She went to the Urgent Care to get COVID tested on 23Feb2021 and had a rapid and PCR test. The rapid test came back negative. She had not received the results for the PCR test yet. She was taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride but she stopped taking that. The hospital directed her stop taking the diphenhydramine hydrochloride earlier in the week. She clarified she was taking a generic version (Lot#: P113966, Expiry Date: Feb2021), coated mini tablets. She clarified the nausea pills she had been taking was the generic for ZOFRAN, ondansetron 4 mg tablet, by mouth, every 8 hours. She confirmed this product was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date on it. She clarified she also had been taking the generic version of TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH, it was the Up and Up Brand acetaminophen (Lot#: P122699, Expiry Date: Nov2022) gel caps, 500mg. COVID-19 rapid test was negative on 23Feb2021; COVID-19 PCR test on 23Feb2021 was unknown results. Patient asked if there was a hotline she can call or an information number where she can talk to somebody about her symptoms. She also reported this to her doctor but the doctor made it clear since it was a private practice, they had limited information. The doctor did take down similar information, she just did not know if there was any further information or a hotline she could call. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Around 6pm I started with a slight headache and by 8pm i had trouble keeping my eyes open.  (headache is not uncommon for me but the extreme drowsiness is).   I slept solid through the night (unusual) and the puppy woke me around 5am. (ususal)  I felt that i had a heavy? head.  My thoughts seemed clear but my head had a fullness to it.  Its difficult to describe.  I was not stuffy.  I had trouble staying awake, to the point I was nodding off at times I should have been able to stay awake.  I did not feel safe to work and felt obligated to call in.  I slept solidly for the next 5 hours.  Later in the day, my affected arm began to have pain radiate from the injection site to my wrist.  (probably not unusual).  600mg of Ibuprofen did not seem to help much.  By the time I went to bed last night (24&#43; hrs after receiving the vaccine) I noticed my axillary nymph nodes were extremely tender to the touch and remain so this morning.  The pain in my arm still continues to radiate to my wrist but not as intense.

                                                had a severe pain in upper left hip; hurt to lift my left leg up (while taking a step forward); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 45-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, lot number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left arm on 24Dec2020 08:15AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated in a hospital facility. Medical history included lyme disease from 2014. Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive other vaccines in last four weeks. Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (LO LOESTRIN FE). On 25Dec2020 07:30AM, the patient had a severe pain in upper left hip. It felt like an IT band issue she had before but this time it didn&#39;t radiate to her knee like it usually does. She did not have exercise since the morning of the 22nd when she did an upper body weight-lifting session. She took ibuprofen that took the edge off, and she was able to finish her day as a nurse in the Covid ICU. The following morning, she felt fine and went to her other job. She was fine in the morning during her usual drills practicing getting out of the helicopter while on the ground. She sat in one of the seats for about 15 minutes while having a discussion when she started to feel the pain again. She got out of the helicopter and tried to walk around, but it hurt to lift her left leg up (while taking a step forward) in Dec2020. She has never experienced this before. She limped back to the hanger, took ibuprofen 600mg and rested/stretched for an hour. The pain was reduced to a minor and tolerable ache. The outcome of the events was recovering. The report was considered non-serious.

                                                I got the vaccine on 12/18/20 on my left arm and on 12/28/20, 10 days after I started to have pain on my upper left arm and the next day the pain went to my armpit, back and forth from my upper left arm to my armpit and this went on for at least 5 days.  On 01/02/21, 15 days after I notice red bumps on my upper left arm and as days went on red bumps show in my armpit, left back, and chest. The pain went from sharp to burning. On 01/06/21 I got the 2nd dose of the vaccine and I told the injection person about the red bumps. I told him that they look like hives. He spoke with the medical doctor about it and doctor said it was ok for me to get the 2nd dose of the vaccine. They think it was a delayed reaction.  They have me monitored for 30 mins after the 2nd dose of the injection before I leave the site. I still have pain and red bumps so I went to see my primary doctor on 01/07/21.  The doctor said that I have shingles. I told him that I never had shingles before and he said maybe the vaccine trigger it. He prescribed me some medications for the shingles.  I don?t know if the vaccine trigger the shingles or just coincidence but I want to report this maybe someone might have the same experience. Thank you.

Started Saturday in the evening( chin, nose) Eyelid and underneath was red and I also had a headache. I had blotches on my cheek. Next day I woke up and no change but I was extremely fatigued.. Monday 10am it started going away. By evening majority of pain was gone. About 98% recovered. I still have some itching and chills.

A 45-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on the right deltoid, on 04Jan2021 at a single dose as she wanted added protection (Covid-19 immunization). The patient medical history was not reported. The patient has no heart issues but has a family history of heart disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient was asking if it is okay to take second dose after experiencing side effects of fever, body ache, joint pain, probably anxiety, chest heaviness 8-10h after (not wheezing, 98% O2 saturation) which returned next day and subsided. On 04Jan2021, the patient got her first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine, she was one of the lucky people who had joint pain, body aches, and a fever for about 3 days. She noticed about 8-10 hours after she got the vaccine that she started feeling heaviness in her chest, chest felt tight and heavy; not shortness of breath, harder to take a deep breath. She had no wheezing. In Jan2021, her oxygen level was 98%. She was chocking it up to anxiety in Jan2021. It went away. She had it the same day and the next day intermittently. It was short and passing. She is still having joint pain and muscle aches in her knees and lower legs. It is intermittent and mainly at night. She is supposed to get the second dose next Friday and asking should she go ahead and get the second dose. The joint pain had went away intermittently on Tuesday, then hit her harder on Wednesday. Thursday she felt okay but the Friday again was having the pain. It is still occurring. It is mainly at night. In the day she feels okay. It is when she lays down to relax that it kicks in. It is mainly irritating but she would say it is medically significant as it has lasted for a while, almost 2 weeks now and she is still having issues.  She takes 1000mg of acetaminophen (TYLENOL) to knock it out. The heaviness in her chest lasted about 1.5 hours the first day, and then went into Tuesday intermittently. The patient recovered from anxiety in Jan2021, body aches and fever on 07Jan2021, heaviness in her chest recovered on 05Jan2021, while other events were not recovered. The reporter assessed the events of Joint pain and muscle aches in her knees and lower legs, and irritating as medically significant. The reporter causality of the events for joint pain and muscle aches in her knees and lower legs, body aches, fever and heaviness in her chest were related to the suspect drug, causality for other events was not reported.  Information about lot number/batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently provided, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of events of Joint pain and muscle aches in her knees and lower legs and irritating.

I got my second shot on 1/14/2021.  Within 12 hours, I had a 101 fever and muscle aches.  I also had axilla lymphadenopathy.  Within 3 days, I was feeling better, however about 8 days post vaccine, I started to experience bouts of tachycardia and dizziness again.  As time progresses, these symptoms are slowly improving.

A 45-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 04Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history ongoing included sickle cell trait (diagnosed as a child, sickly as a child, found out in 2016. It was reported that patient has the sickle cell that mimics the disease), ongoing high blood pressure, and ongoing genital herpes, and pre-diabetes, all diagnosed prior to vaccination, and &#39;blood pressure&#39;. Concomitant medication included chlorthalidone from 2018 and ongoing for &#39;blood pressure&#39;. It was reported that patient got her first dose of Covid vaccine on 04Jan2021. Patient stated that she has been experiencing some effects, started maybe 2 days after, she began experiencing fatigue (06Jan2021). Patient also stated that she has genital herpes diagnosed before the vaccine, and stated that she usually doesn&#39;t have an outbreak unless there is extreme stress on body. On 08Jan2021, patient clarified she experienced a genital herpes outbreak and thought that it may associated. Patient stated that she treated it with valaciclovir (VALTREX) and some cream and it went away. States that she had another outbreak after, treated it again, and it went away and now she is struggling with another outbreak of genital herpes. Patient also reported that she has on and off headaches (also reported as intermittent headaches) on 04Jan2021, states this could be due to her high/increased blood pressure which she first experienced on 14Jan2021 (as reported). Patient mentioned that her blood pressure has been higher than it ever has been after the vaccine. Patient also stated that she noticed that after the vaccine it was out of control, that she got a blood pressure cuff and it was 149/103, she contacted her nephrologist, stated she is treating it with her usual diuretic and the doctor just prescribed her amlodipine (NORVASC). Patient further stated that she is still struggling to get the diastolic blood pressure in the 90s, stated this is abnormal for her. Also is experiencing severe hip pain bilateral on 08Jan2021 after the vaccine. Patient further reported that she was a little over weight - usually about 150 sometimes 162 around this time she was 162. Patient clarified that her current weight is 159.2 and stated that she was diagnosed with sickle cell trait and stated that she has the kind that mimics the disease and will have a lot of side effects of sickle cell disease. Patient further added that she also has stage 3 kidney failure on 18Jan2021 due to either her high blood pressure or sickle cell trait and is also pre-diabetic. Patient also thought that the outbreak was associated with stress on body. Patient wanted to know if she refuses the second vaccine, if the first vaccine will do anything. Outcome of the events &#39;Stage 3 kidney failure&#39;, &#39;High/Increased blood pressure&#39;, &#39;Outbreak of genital herpes&#39;, and &#39;on and off headaches/Intermittent headache&#39; was not recovered, outcome of the event &#39;extreme fatigue&#39; was recovered on 06Jan2021, outcome of the event &#39;hip pain bilateral&#39; was recovering, outcome of the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stage 3 kidney failure was due to either the pre-existing high blood pressure or sickle cell trait or prediabetic condition, and was unrelated to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).

                                                In discussion with Dr., medical director at Detox, she  arrived night of 2/3/21 was quite intoxicated so was not going through any  withdrawal.  She was getting vitals and CIW  checked regularly.  First dose of  chlordiazepoxide 25mg was 2/4 at 1:25pm for CIWA 9.  She had repeat vitals at  5:50pm, CIWA 1, vitals: P 67, 118/79, 94% on RA, T 98.3.  she had complained of  some &#34;pressure in her head&#34; and feeling anxious, but otherwise denied other  complaints.  she was talking with others in the group, then other patients report  she suddenly started having seizure like activity around 6:45pm, med techs came  to help and found her stiff, gurgling.  they tried to get vitals on her, called  911, noticed that at 6:54pm she had lost a pulse and they started CPR.  paramedics arrived at 7:08pm and she was brought to ED.   Pt BIBA in cardiac arrest. Pt was at Detox Center when she  was reported to have seizure-like activity followed by collapse. She  was found to be pulseless and CPR initiated by staff members. EMS  arrived and performed approx 15 min of CPR and gave pt epi x 3 and  bicarb. No shocks administered but they did not report a rhythm.   In the emergency room the patient arrived and was found to be pulseless with PEA arrest, CPR was initiated, patient was intubated. ROSC ultimately achieved, patient remained very acidotic despite ventilator adjustment, head CT revealed cerebral edema. Pt also found to be profoundly anemic with a hemoglobin of 5 and platelets of 37, she was thought to be GI bleeding so medications for this were initiated. Patient then became more hypoxemic with bradycardia, consultation with neurosurgery and critical care medicine at tertiary care center deemed ongoing CPR futile. Patient arrested at 2:30AM on 2/5, pronounced dead at 2:48AM.

                                                At about 10pm the injection site pain had radiated to my armpit and breast area. I took ibuprofen and tried to go to sleep. I was unable to sleep on my left side as normal. Around 12:30am I woke up cold, shivering violently, with a fever of 103.°3. My feet were also burning.  I woke up around 2:30am. Fever was down to about 102.4°, feet were still burning and my face and eyes were swollen. I took more ibuprofen and put used cold compress on my eyes. Around 4:30am I woke up with abdominal pain and pain in my hips. Fever was lower, eyes were better but face still swollen and feet still burning. I called off work at that time. By about 8am fever broke and have just had an intense headache.

                                                I experienced Fatigue, chest tightness, and increased blood pressure the first 2 days. Day 5 I started having pain in my upper back, left side. The next day had increased discomfort and developed a rash. Today, it is extremely painful and spread from the upper back to across my left  breast. My PCP agrees that it is Shingles. I am beginning a course of Valtex today, to lesson the severity of symptoms.

A 46-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Dec2020 10:30 at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ectopic pregnancy, hay fever. Concomitant medication received within 2 weeks included: loratadine, colecalciferol (vitamin D), olly womens multivitamin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No known allergies. About 15 minutes after the vaccine the patient experienced jaw tightening and muscle spasms. The patient was given oral Benadryl 50 mg. About 5 minutes after taking the Benadryl, her entire face and around her mouth went numb. The patient began having heart palpitations and felt a wave of heat rush up her back. She had hives on her chest. The patient received 1 dose of epinephrine from an Epi-Pen and transported to the emergency room for further treatment. Adverse event start date: 22Dec2020 11:00 AM. Events were considered as non-serious. Events resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse event included: Benadryl, Epinephrine, Solumedrol, Pepcid. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had been tested for COVID-19. Test Name: SARS-CoV-2 by PCR (Nasal Swab) on 30Dec2020: Negative. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The temporal relationship is suggestive of an acute anaphylactic reaction. Based on the temporal relationship and the known pattern of response, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events.

But I am experiencing numbness and tingling throughout the entire length of my arm.  It is not severe and I am still able to conduct my work and daily chores, but it is very concerning to me.  It is now 5 days later, and the numbness is not any better.  My left pinky finger is the worst out of all of my digits.  I&#39;m not sure if they somehow hit a nerve during the injection or if this is a side effect of the shot.

                                                15 minutes and 21 seconds after shot was given, I felt suddenly very hot, lightheaded and I could feel my pulse escalating. Nurse in the post-shot monitoring tent took vitals to confirm pulse at 95, when typically 68. I was laid down and BP dropped to 110/78. Chest tightness that I am familiar with from asthma started to develop and my neck and throat and upper shoulders felt very tight and constricted. I had some trouble swallowing water as though my throat was constricted and my breathing felt shallow. Nurses provided care and I was asked to get up and sit in a chair again. Within a minute, I felt dizzy and disoriented again and heart rate went up. The tightness in my chest and throat and shallow breathing continued along with my voice becoming hoarse.  The doctor on call asked if I?d had these symptoms before and I said I had after eating shrimp years ago. He decided to transfer me to the ER for monitoring . I stayed at the ER for about an hour and a half and was monitored. The constricted throat and asthma  chest tightness did not subside but did not get worse. Doctor recommended Benadryl every 6 hours as symptoms persisted. Within a half hour of taking 25 mg of Benadryl, I started to feel improved breathing and less throat constriction and easier swallowing. After the second dose of Benadryl, symptoms were much 70% gone, except for hoarse voice abs very slight tightness with swallowing.  I had informed the injection staff prior to receiving my vaccine that I am a person with a history of anaphylaxis (not to a vaccine) that required and epi pen and overnight hospital stay in the past .

                                                About 5 min after receiving vaccine - had just sat down after vaccine and had a weird sensation: like felt like rushed through my body and then instantly my heart started racing and I felt it thump into my throat. Let nurse in attendance know and she took me to another area secluded from others and told me to relax. Sat down. Hooked me up to monitors; blood pressure cuff  and  finger pulse and she left to go get someone and she brought EMT back with her. Felt tight in chest; in neck felt like there&#39;s tightening; but could still breathe; felt heavy: chest. Neck felt tight. Felt like I needed an inhaler. I don&#39;t have it with me as I only have asthma in spring and fall. They kept telling me to calm down and I wasn&#39;t feeling nervous. I was trying to relax. EMT asked questions and he said that the same thing happened to him. He told me I couldn&#39;t leave  Event Center until things calmed down for me. Released her when I felt fine but was just really tired and kind of shaky. I felt so exhausted. Told EMT that and he told me he would feel that way if he had just ran a marathon. I had slept 12 hours the night before. He didn&#39;t tell me what my heartrate went up to.  I left event center  at 9:49 pm. Started feeling strange again when doing errands and was at store afterwards (about 30 or 40 min later) - nauseous; dizzy; sweaty, clammy. Heart was racing again. I told husband I didn&#39;t feel right. Felt like I needed to sit because I was shaky. Left and went to vehicle. As we sat in car, I told him something wasn&#39;t feeling right. Mouth was so dry. He started driving. I felt like we were driving down a tunnel.Husband looked at me and said you don&#39;t look right either. Took me to ER in nearest hospital: blood pressure high; heart rate elevated; ER           (Hospital) The doctor did lab work. Triponin levels elevated; potassium levels low - sign of a heart episode and needed to get in control. Gave me potassium and took  more blood work and troponin levels started coming down. Dr advised me not to go back to get second dose. Personal Care Dr confirmed that I shouldn&#39;t get the 2nd dose - put in my records that I am allergic to this vaccine.  The next day I had severe diarrhea and terrible pain in my arm that went all the way down and up into my neck and whole right side head hurt. (really bad headache). Extreme fatigue. Went back to work on the following Monday evening and was exhausted doing my job. When I say family Dr on Tuesday, I didn&#39;t want to be taken off work because I was in the right place where people could take care of me and I&#39;d taken time off at holidays. That entire week was a lot of exhaustion and tiredness.

                                                Pain, numbness, weakness in arm opposite site of injection.   Time line regarding possible adverse event from COVID 10 Vaccine Dec 21, received COVID-19 Vaccine #1 in right arm lot #EH9899 Dec 23- mild pain in left shoulder, did not do anything that I could pinpoint as the cause of this, no injuries, falls or accidents Dec 24, pain intensified Dec 28, 2020- went to primary MD for exam, gave several medications and ordered an MRI of C-spine which was completed on this day.  Dec 29- pain has continued to intensify, now shoulder, and entire left arm. Fingers on left hand intermittently numb except for pointer finger that stays numb, and hand is colder than right hand Dec 29, 2020- results of C-Spine showed no significant issues. Small herniation in one of the disks. Per MD, ?more suspicious of a muscular issue or something external to spine pinching that nerve?. Pain has continued despite medications ordered.  Dec 30, 2020 MD referred me to a Neuroversion for pain control. I did not want to go here yet, I wanted to know what was causing the issue, not just treat the pain, decided to wait to make this appointment and instead get an appointment with a Neurologist on Monday due to offices being closed on New Year?s Eve.  January 4, 2021 pain, numbness and now weakness have persisted all weekend, appointment with Neurologist scheduled for Tuesday January 5, 2021. January 5, 2021, appointment with Neurologist, suspecting Parsonage-Turner Syndrome.   Parsonage Turner syndrome (PTS) is characterized by the sudden onset of shoulder and upper arm pain followed by progressive (worsening over time) weakness and/or atrophy of the affected area. The pain is felt along the path of one or more nerves and often has no obvious physical cause. The network of nerves involved in this syndrome is called the brachial plexus and it controls movement and sensation in the shoulders and arms. The cause is still unknown (idiopathic). However, researchers believe that most cases are due to an autoimmune response following exposure to an illness or environmental factor. Suspected triggers include viral and bacterial infections, surgery, vaccinations, injury, childbirth, strenuous exercise, certain medical procedures, and various health conditions. Treatment is symptomatic and may include pain relievers, corticosteroids and physical therapy.[1][2] January 6, 2021- MRI of left shoulder completed January 8 2021- Follow up of MRI with neurologist. No abnormalities seen on MRI, ruled out any other tumors, or anatomical issues causing pain. Diagnosis Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. Increased dosages of current medications and added another to control nerve pain.  January 9, 2021- pain seems to be lessening, numbness and weakness continues January 10, 2021- significant pain returned, numbness and weakness continues. I did get the 2nd dose of the COVID-19 lot # EJ1685 in R arm vaccine today, as MD did not advice against it and I still believe that the vaccine is important.

I also had a muscle pain in the arm and I felt tired during the day and in the evening. My pulse rate continues to be high. My pulse rate was 100 on the second day and for number of days it is around 95. Today it was 95 most of the day. I have not been regularly checking my pulse rate before, but based on what I found in some information in my medical record, it is most likely around 75. I notice the higher pulse rate through pulsation in the chest and temples. I have a hard time concentrating on work and reading things on the screen.

A 46-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020. The patient received her second dose. After getting the second dose she is having soreness of her left arm where she got the injection, it is painful and she expected that. It is not depriving her of moving or anything. Now (08Jan2021) her whole body is achy, has chills, she has a temperature of 99.7, she is tired all over. She is calling to see if it safe to take acetaminophen or something else OTC around the clock to pass the symptoms or will it cause a delay in anything with the vaccine? She mentioned she heard there was a time frame where could not take anything because it would cause a delay. She is wondering if she should be worried she has COVID and get tested since it came back? She doesn&#39;t want to report she is doing it online. The side effects she is experiencing are headache, chills, muscle, and joint pain. Also, last night she had GI issues. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A 46-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 in deltoid left at single dose for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications.  Family medical history relevant to event was none. Relevant tests were none. Patient reported she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021 and had pain at the injection site. On 07Jan21 she started having muscle aches and got something that look like hives on the arm and her skin felt really hot to touch, it was fire engine red on the right upper arm. On 08Jan2021, she woke up and felt like she got hit by a tractor trailer, has severe aches, voice very raspy, and very wiped out with headaches.  Patient mentioned injection site arm was bright red and warm to touch after injection, but has improved. When waking up this morning on 08Jan2021 even walking this morning from the bedroom to the bathroom she was fatigued and it has gotten better with her walking around, but she still felt wiped out. The muscle aches was very short lived. She went to do something at work and it took a minute for her to catch her breath and that and the muscle aches went away and that was it. An hour later she felt very flushed and itchy and coworkers joked with her about what she ate for lunch, which was nothing different. On the opposite arm from injection arm she had hives on the lower right arm. They were there about 15-20 minutes and it turned completely fire engine red and that lasted about half an hour. She showed the doctor she worked with and they recommended diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), which she didn&#39;t take, it was weird. All this subsided and she felt fine afterwards. Last night she felt very fatigued when walking around the house. This morning when she woke up she felt very, very, very fatigued. Walking took a lot of effort out of her. It is hard to explain, but people say this was how they felt when they had Covid. She felt very lethargic and very tired. Patient still had a lingering headache, but nothing like she felt earlier this morning. It&#39;s not terrible, but it wasn&#39;t pleasant for a couple of hours. Patient was unable to provide seriousness for today&#39;s events (08Jan2021), and stated it wasn&#39;t really life threatening, but more significant than yesterday. Patient denied having any other vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No history of problems or adverse events with vaccines in past. Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine with events were reported as related.  Events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Outcome of severe aches, voice very raspy, headache/lingering headache, wiped out /fatigued/tired were not recovered; outcome of lethargic, it took a minute for her to catch her breath, flushed and itchy was unknown, and outcome of other events were recovering.

SEVERE headache began on Day 2 which I wondered if I should go to urgent care.  Unable to tolerate walking or being &#34;up&#34; for more than 3-5 minutes at a time.  Notable fatigue.  A week later now, still having daily headaches which are moderate in nature.

                                                This is a report about me. I received my Covid vaccine on Sunday after my hospital shift (if was first dose of the Pfizer vaccine). Other than some muscle soreness, which I expected, I started experiencing numbness and tingling in the arm that received the shot (my left arm). It is now 4 days later, and the numbness/tingling is not any better. I don&#39;t know if this is a frequent side effect that will go away in time, but it is very concerning to me.

                                                Hello,   When I received my second Covid vaccine, I was asked to report my side effects to this email address.  They are as follows:   After Vaccine 1 (12/22/20):  I had the vaccine at around 1:30pm.  I only had arm-stiffness at first.  Approx. 24 hours after however (1:30pm the next day), I started having chills and feeling like I had a fever.  My entire body ached but I did not have a headache.  These side effects lasted through the night for approx. 14 hours.   The following day I woke up with a surge of energy and felt very much like I had been given a shot of adrenalin.  I?m not sure that I have ever felt as good.   After Vaccine 2 (01/11/21):  I had much more severe side effects after the second vaccine.  I had this vaccine at approx. 1:30 pm and within a couple of hours I started to feel a bit tired.  At approx. midnight that night, I started having body aches and a headache that woke me up.  I had chills and was oscillating between feeling very cold and feeling very hot.  Through the night I had to change my clothing several times due to sweating.  These symptoms lasted for the entire following day.  The second day after the vaccine I felt much better but still a little tired.    Of greatest concern is that I have a lingering pain deep within my left arm (the arm into which the shots were given).  Having a hard time extending my arm and doesn;t seems to be going away.  Sometimes it feels tingly and I sometimes have loss of grip and/or weakness in the entire arm.     Hope this helps you in compiling the side effects.  Thank you.

I felt the same mild fatigue and headache as with the first dose, but yesterday (Thursday (01/20/21) afternoon, around 3-4pm), I noticed soreness in my right axillary area, and found lymphadenopathy with palpation. I took additional ibuprofen and tylenol, and the pain has lessened somewhat today (Friday 01/22/21, noon)

                                                Within a few minutes of vaccine, I got a severe piercing headache and nausea / vomiting which we attributed to nerves and I went to go home without reporting. During the drive the headache and nausea got worse and my extremities and face began to tingle. My chest felt tight. My body was shaking. My colleague noted weak pulses and pale complexion. I am a doctor and gave myself epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and within 60 to 90 seconds the symptoms improved dramatically. I had my husband pick me up at the office and went home. The headache and nausea worsened on the drive but then settled down significantly. I rested for a few hours, then took oral pred 20 mg at about 2:45. I noticed that my headache was back and very intense at about 3:15 pm. No nausea this time, but my left eye began itching and it was very tight / hard to breathe. My extremities began tingling and I had spasms / tremors of my muscles. I injected another 0.3 mg epi into my thigh and followed with dex sodium phosphate 4 mg IM. Symptoms resolved within about 2 to 3 minutes. I took 40mg more of oral pred. I also took 10 mg of pepcid PO.   I am still feeling well now with no headaches or other symptoms at this writing (7:30 pm), but I have another doctor with me and we are 2 minutes from the ER if needed. I am marking unknown below since it has only been a few hours without symptoms.

Hard to walk. progressivly got worse to point unable to walk without pain, lay down without pain. only able to sit.  Steroids, NSAIDS, ICE, Whirlpool Therapy, message, chiropractor. Neurologist consult unable to walk.    2/1/21 MRI completed Circumferential disc bulge with superimposed left lateral recess and foraminal disc protrusion at L4-5 resulting in moderate to severe left foraminal stenosis and impingement of the exiting left L4 nerve root.  There is contact of the traversing bilateral L4 nerve roots with some mass effect on the traversing left L5 nerve root.  Correlate for left L4 and/or L5 radiculopathy.   3. Circumferential disc bulge with superimposed right lateral recess and foraminal disc protrusion at L2-L3 with contact the traversing right L3 nerve root, but no nerve root compression.  No compression of the exiting right L2 nerve root.  Correlate for right L3 radiculopathy   It is my impression that patient presents with acute onset of left L4 radiculopathy.  Her MRI scan suggests a far lateral/foraminal left L4-L5 disk herniation.  She also has some underlying lateral recess stenosis which is fairly mild.     I discussed the above findings with patient and her husband.  I reviewed her MRI scan with the help of a spine model.  I outlined both conservative and surgical approaches.  However, given her findings and the severity of her pain currently, I think one could argue that a left L4-L5 microlumbar diskectomy via far lateral approach would be her most definitive option.  I did outline this procedure in detail with the help of a spine model.  I outlined the risks which include but are not limited to infection, bleeding complications, nerve root and/or cauda equina injury, cerebrospinal fluid leak, recurrent disk herniation, spinal instability, the possibility that she could require additional spine surgery in the future, and the possibility that her would not be relieved to her satisfaction.  We also discussed trying a left L4-L5 foraminal steroid injection but she has had injections in the past and she actually felt like it gave her more pain.  At this point she would like to go ahead and schedule the left L4-L5 microlumbar diskectomy via far lateral approach with METRx.  This will be scheduled on an elective basis in the near future.

A 46-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient reported that she received the COVID-19 vaccine at a hospital, patients were allowed to stay for 30 minutes, then they were released. After she left the hospital she started to feel an itch, like an allergy, it was not a rash, just an urge to scratch herself. She started feeling dizzy, nauseous, and a headache. Yesterday (02Feb2021), she could hardly stand up. Today (03Feb2021) she did not got to work, she do not feel well, she have pain in her body, fever and chills. The (most serious) issue was her throat, she feel like she have something (stuck) in her throat, she can&#39;t speak, she feel like she can&#39;t breathe normally. She haven&#39;t felt well at all, today is the 3rd day after receiving the vaccine and she couldn&#39;t go to work, she was nervous because she was fine (before receiving the vaccine). She does not want to go out because she feel very tired and dizzy, she was afraid of falling down in the street and getting hurt, she can hardly walk and she feel tired, experienced fatigue and sore throat. She have a cold, she feel terrible. she feel isolated and afraid. She will have to go to the hospital, if she cannot breathe well. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about Lot/batch no has been requested.

                                                In the first 5 mins after the injection I became very irritable and then within 10 mins had a cold sensation in my head that I had previously had after a reaction to sulfa and had almost passed out.  I told a staff person who had me talk to one of the nurses &amp; put me in a separate space from people getting vaccinated.  The nurses then wasted a lot of time talking to me about anxiety instead of treating me.  The cold sensation traveled from my head down my neck, there was a sharp pain in my left breast, and then my heart started racing.  My lips and tongue on the left side started swelling.  I told the nurses this but they ignored me.  Eventually they brought in equipment to monitor my vital signs.  My blood pressure  and heart rate were higher than I had ever seen them and kept rising.  The head nurse eventually said I needed medical care &amp; there was no doctor on site.  She called the paramedics.  It was now 1 hour after I told them something was wrong.  The paramedics thought this was temporary because my bp fell to 153 [I told them I did not have a hist of bp this high]  from where it had been before &amp;   gave me Benadryl pills. (The ER doctor later said they should have done something).  Later that night my HR went up to 220 and I was taken to the ER.  The ER doctor also wasted time assuming it was anxiety but bloodwork showed I was in shock.  They first treated me with 4 aspirin, then Atavan, which all did nothing.  My bp was up to 189 the last time I could view the monitor.  Sodium chloride ivs, Bendaryl ivs were given after the bloodwork.  Diltiazem was eventually also given. I had palpitations that caused my entire body to shake. EKG showed I had developed an atrial flutter and the doctor said the flutter, arrhythmia, and tachycardia were caused by the shock from the vaccine disrupting the electrical signals in my heart.  I stayed overnight in the ER until Sat morning.  I took Diltiazem but jolting palpitations and tremors did not stop.  I saw a cardiologist on the 25th who concluded I had gone into shock from the vaccine, and I was given the wrong medication, and put me on metropolol.  Metoprolol lowered my bp and reduced the palpations.  I weaned off it with the doctor&#39;s permission.  I still have palpitations.

I was barely able to move the left arm, and I could not bend it due to severe pain in the elbow joint. At approximately 0800, I started having diarrhea that lasted for no more than an hour. By noon the soreness and aching had reduced to a moderate pain (5/10). I was able to bend my left arm, but the arm remained sore at the elbow joint until 01/10/2021. By the morning of 01/10/2021, all the symptoms were gone.

This lasted for about 20-25 minutes and then  mostly resolved.  I was monitored by the paramedics.  I had normal vitals at the time of evaluation which was soon after notifying staff. After the 1st injection I had a similar episode, but I thought it was anxiety related.

By morning I had a bad headache and terrible body/muscle aches. I was unable to report to work that day. By midafternoon, the nausea and stomach pains subsided, all other symptoms remained along with then getting a 100.5 fever. I was taking Tylenol every 4 hours since 1am and keeping hydrated. By midnight I was exhausted and was finally able to sleep. I woke the following morning with a dull headache and just felt achy. I felt much better by that evening (now Monday). Tuesday morning I woke with discomfort to my left armpit and clavicle area. I then noticed swelling, the areas felt ?lumpy? and were very tender to touch. That lasted about 2 days.

                                                The first night of the shot I had severe pain in both arms and could not sleep. The first 3 days I felt tired and chilled, without fever. After the third day, symptoms subsided and I was back to normal activity. On the 7th day following the vaccine, I began having pain in the armpit of the left side. It was painful to have pressure on the area and to raise the arm overhead. It progressed on the the 8th day with increased pain and tenderness to touch. On the 9th day, I had severe pain with palpation and could feel a lump in the armpit. I have no redness, heat, or rash in the area. I went to my physician with concern because I have had a double mastectomy two years ago.

                                                Mild headache; Weakness; Loose stools/diarrhea; it was hard for me to walk; stomach ache/stomach cramping; Fatigue; Some sweating in the middle of the night; some pain behind her eyes; Shoulder area is sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient herself). A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 11:00 in left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Patient take medications for mood and sleep with were very low doses. But she didn&#39;t have any medical problem. She took 10 mg of fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC), 150 mg of bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN) and 10 mg of doxepin for sleep. Yesterday after the vaccination towards the end of the day (09Jan2021 approximately 11 o&#39; clock am), she developed a stomach ache about 5 pm and it went on throughout the night and she normally didn&#39;t have issues with her stomach. Maybe it was because she was hungry because she went ice skating with her son where they wore mask in the afternoon yesterday and she was feeling perfectly fine. But when she came home, she noticed her stomach started hurting at 5 pm and she wondered maybe it is because she was hungry. And after she ate it was still bothering her and then it got progressively worst in the middle of the night where it would wake her up periodically. But she was so fatigue that she was able to sleep still. But she noticed in the middle of the night that her stomach would wake her up because it was aching and cramping in the middle of the night. And then she also had some sweating in the middle of the night as well as some pain behind her eyes. And today (10Jan2021) she had some fatigue which she noticed was not usual, she had mild headache which she saw was a common side effect. And then in the morning (10Jan2021) some fatigue and weakness like when she walked to the bathroom it was hard for her to walk. And when she went to use the bathroom she had some loose stools which was not common for her unless at all she was sick or have eaten something that makes her stomach really sick which was very unusual for her. Her stomach was still hurting her, if she walked it will start getting cramped so she was sitting down. The only thing she toon this morning was 2 acetaminophen medicine tablets because she was having pain behind her eyes when she woke up. She was just going to say she had influenza type A and type B on several occasions. And these symptoms are similar to when she had type B influenza, which was not as difficult as type A. So this is, they seemed to be like a mild version of type B influenza which she had terrible stomach issues, diarrhea and fatigue and pain behind the eyes from type B influenza. She had not any sickness because she work from home and she had limited field contact. So, she hadn&#39;t had illness from past year now. Because she worked from home. She provided mental health counselling remotely. So, she didn&#39;t think it could be attributed from anything else. The left on arm which was up toward like shoulder area and it was sore but it was tolerable in Jan2021. Outcome of stomach ache/stomach cramping was not recovered, and outcome of other events were unknown.

A 47-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot Number EL3249, via an unspecified route of administration from 25Jan2021 14:00 (at the age of 47 years old), Dose 2, as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included she had her tonsils out on an unknown date. She was a nurse that works with COVID patients; she got tested twice last week (Jan2021), both were negative. She had no pre-existing medical conditions. She has never had a problem with vaccines. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously received dose 1 of BNT162B2 on 04Jan2021 (Lot # EX9231) and experienced no reaction then. The patient had the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine around 2 PM yesterday (25Jan2021) and she kept moving around in bed and feeling sick last night. That night she was just tired and achy but she thought that could just be from working. She went to bed early and she woke up around 1:50 or 2 AM with chills so she went and got a thermometer. She woke up at about 2 AM (26Jan2021) with a 103 fever and chills and her right carotid on her neck felt swollen and her face felt swollen, but her right carotid hurt. Her skin just burns; she went to take a shower. With the skin burning she knew it was sore to touch but when she got in the shower, that was when she noticed it hurt. She was really achy; her legs were aching and she was having shooting pains in different spots. She commented that she called out today (26Jan2021), she never calls out; all she wanted to do was take a shower and she wondered if she needed to go to the doctor. Her skin burns even when she was showering; every part her skin burns. She was also having muscle and joint pain and cough and the back of her ribs hurt (Jan2021). The other thing was nausea (Jan2021).  The fever and chills were persisting and were about the same. She was hoping for it to go down so she could go to work to tomorrow (27Jan2021). The clinical outcome of the fever, chills, and her right carotid on her neck felt swollen and hurt was not recovered.   The clinical outcome of feeling sick, tired and achy, face feels swollen, skin burning, muscle and joint pain, cough, back of her ribs hurt, nausea, and shooting pains in different spots was unknown. The reporter states she thinks what she is reporting was directly related to the product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of the reported events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A minute later fatigue hit and I was starting to fall asleep at the wheel. I live 1 mile away so I made it home. Now my head was getting fuzzy.  Called a co-worker to tell her what was happening and she said my speech was slurring. I felt drunk and hungover at the same time.  I went to bed and slept for an hour. I woke up and felt very fatigued. I  finally went to bed for the night then was awoken with severe arm pain. My entire upper arm felt so tight but I it was soft upon palpation. I fell asleep and awoke to terrible arm pain again. I started crying in bed but fell asleep again. I woke up in the morning with severe upper arm pain and minor headache. I couldn&#39;t rotate my arm back to put my bra on so I took some ibuprofen. That had immediate relief for my arm and headache. I ran one errand and was wiped out. The fatigue hit again.  The arm pain came back so I took another ibuprofen with relief. I had no energy so laid around for the rest of the day. I woke up on Sunday and finally felt normal with  just pain at the injection site.  The 2 other medical people that have had similar reactions like mine with dizziness and feeling light-headed have one thing in common with me...we are all vegetarians. I don&#39;t know if that makes a difference with protein metabolism or other enzymatic activity, but we are the only 3 that I know of out of all of our co-workers who have received the vaccine to react like this.

                                                On 1/1/2021, in the early morning, I started having severe shoulder pain in my right shoulder (the arm opposite of the injection site arm).  By the afternoon the pain was so bad that I was unable to lift my arm all the way.  I sent a message to my PCP but have not heard back yet, probably because it is a holiday.  I have been applying ice and heat to the area with little relief.

                                                I was diagnosed with shingles on my left side on 12/31/2020, with symptoms (burning/skin sensitivity on my back (probably on 12/27, definitely by 12/28 progressing to waves of pain in my back to abdomen).  On 12/30, a rash appeared on my abdomen starting below my navel and going around my left side to about an inch before my spine.   I submitted a picture and it was diagnosed as shingles via a virtual visit.  It is  responding to antiviral therapy, although I still have a rash and pain (but improving). I did not go through the COVID vaccine side effect virtual visit route because I did not really think it was a side effect and knew I had a history of chicken pox and have been experiencing ongoing stress.  The provider for the virtual visit told me to still report it for it to be investigated, but she too, thought it was likely unrelated, but still should be investigated.

Symptoms are swollen cheeks and welts , sudden itchiness at the site of my mask placement. The reason for this report is a sudden onset of excruciating and debilitating pain throughout my body specifically pain of my right shoulder radiating down my sprightly arm. I have been receiving testing and treatment for ongoing neuropathy due to Longhauler syndrome, however This recent pain is so debilitating, I spend most of my time in bed.  I have been experiencing chills then profuse sweating.  I also so fatigued, I sleep much of the day.  I have been having episodes of tachycardia with chest tightness which has increased since after having the vaccine. I also become short winded on exertion. I?ve been waking up in a panic and sweating.

A 48-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) via unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included depression, had hip surgery last year (from 2020) and anxiety. Concomitant medication included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) for anxiety and depression. esomeprazole magnesium (NEXIUM [ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM]), on regular basis naproxen sodium (ALEVE) and paracetamol (TYLENOL) because of her hip. Patient was calling because she was vaccinated yesterday, 03Jan2021. Patient was a nurse and she got the COVID Vaccine yesterday. she wanted to go into the symptom checker or whatever because she was having, she woke, she wasn&#39;t (incomplete sentence). she had a difficult time sleeping last night. She woke up like with all her joints start just achy and she did not have a great time. she wanted to report her symptoms. patient have other things. No really big co-morbidities, like, she had depression. she had some body issues like she had a &#34;torn labor&#34; and stuff like that but that needs to be repaired but not like blood pressure, diabetes, none of those things. she had hip surgery last year. she took two Aleve in the morning and two 500 Tylenol. And she took one more Aleve in the evening and two more Tylenol. As of causality, patient stated she believe so. It&#39;s much more intense than it was, than she was feeling yesterday. she definitely could feel it after she had the vaccination. she got like this aching all up her spine and sort of the weird headache for about (incomplete sentence). it was for the rest of the day about an hour after she got the vaccination. She was a little too un-tuned with her body aching. Consumer stated, &#34;Is there, I mean, more I was calling to register with that CDC thing or whatever to report, you know just what&#39;s happening. I figured it was probably, kind of part of the research study or whatever for symptoms and tracking and all that. Is that what I am doing as well too by doing this or is that something separate?&#34; When probed if reported through CDC questionnaire, consumer stated, &#34;No, I went onto the website and it said that on CDC website the worst thing and it said that you needed a code or something a key code to get into the program and I don&#39;t. Is this where the reporting is going or how do I register with the (app Name) or whatever? Is that what I did by telling you what&#39;s going on?&#34; When informed about the role of Pfizer Drug Safety, consumer stated, &#34;I did not understand that safety report or I figured that we were like also assisting in some kind of research trial type thing too. Are they going to call me or no? Is this the last time I&#39;m hearing from anyone?&#34; No investigation assessment. No Lab Work. No Treatment. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 48-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), intramuscular on 04Jan2021 11:30 at single dose at right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included non-Hodgkins lymphoma from 1995, invasive ductal carcinoma 2009 with breast reconstruction; phrenic nerve paralysis left side; cardiomyopathy.

On 04Jan2021 15:30, noted starting around 4 hours after vaccine, the patient experienced mild fatigue, mild intermittent headache, mild intermittent ache in knee joints. The patient was unsure if they were vaccine related but became a little more intense as the evening went on (next 5 hours) but still overall were mild, but enough for the patient to determine they seemed related to the vaccine. Also noted about 6 hours after vaccine, on 04Jan2021 17:30, mild brain fog-feeling &#34;stupid&#34; and struggling with connections, like not picking up on humor immediately, trying to put things away in the wrong place. The patient went to bed about 8-9 hours after vaccine (8pm). The patient usually gets up at 4:45-5am. She was so tired the next morning and &#34;stupid&#34; with brain fog that she called in. She wasn&#39;t uncomfortable per se, no headache the next day, only mild joint ache in knees, fatigue and brain fog. No serious reactions. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient did not receive treatment for the events.   Information about lot/ batch number is requested.

                                                At approximately hour 40 post vaccine my Axillary lymph node became very enlarged, painful and hard.  It was causing a tingling in my arm, like a pinched nerve and was painful to keep my arm in a relaxed position.  The node was visible if I lifted my arm above my head.  With a dose of ibuprofen, the swelling reduced but it was still palpable and painful for the next 18 hours.  By the 72 hour vaccine mark, all symptoms were gone.

A 48-Year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) on 07Jan2021  at single dose via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid  for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included Multiple sclerosis/Diagnosed in 1991 or 1992. She also had 2 previous reactions to a pneumonia vaccine two years in a row. About 30-45 minutes after she had fainting episodes. On 07Jan2021 within 20 minutes she had a really weird sharp pain in her upper back the size of a cantelope. On the same day she complained pretty bad swelling in the shoulder joint that she had the shot in, along with stiffness in her neck and joints, and in both of her hands, fingers, and elbows. She also had pain in both biceps. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced severe fatigue and 10Jan2021 Bilateral arm weakness/dysesthesia. They were floppy noodles and she could hardly use them. She could not hold her purse in her hands. She has not had this issue before with her Multiple Sclerosis. This took about a full week and a half for that to go away. It was like weakness/dysesthesia. She talked to her doctor and he said he felt like the shot had exacerbated her Multiple Sclerosis potentially.  At the time of the reporting the patient was recovering from Bilateral arm weakness/dysesthesia. She recovered from fatigue on 09Jan2021, from &#39;Within 20 minutes she had a really weird sharp pain in her upper back the size of a cantelope&#39; on 10Jan2021and from other reported events on 12Jan2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of bilateral arm weakness/dysesthesia cannot be excluded. The events are confounded by underlying multiple sclerosis.

A 48-year-old female patient (also the age at vaccination) received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown: Unable to locate or read the details), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 23Jan2021 12:45 PM at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included Chiari Malformation (reported as other medical history). The patient has no COVID prior to vaccination, also not COVID tested post vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. The patient is not pregnant. There was no other vaccine in four weeks. It was reported that the patient had other medications in two weeks (unspecified). The patient had the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 02Jan2021 at 12:45 PM at the left arm for COVID-19 immunization (Lot number not reported: Unable to locate or read the details, facility type vaccine: Other). It was reported by the patient that: &#34;I woke up this morning (on 31Jan2021 at 08:00 AM) and my left side of neck was very sore. I went to rub it and immediately felt a swollen lump /lymph about halfway between my ear and bottom of my neck. It is about the size of a dime. My second dose was 8 days ago (23Jan2021). I am assuming this is normal response to Pfizer vaccine, but all I read said reactions should be over 2 to 4 days after vaccine. Is this considered normal or should I contact my PCP? &#34; No treatment was received. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information about Lot and batch number has been requested.

                                                A couple of hours after the vaccine, I began to have extreme muscle pain, both in the left arm and in my other arm, back. I became extremely fatigued and felt lethargic. I felt flushed and slightly nauseated, but mostly I felt body pain and extremely tired. This continued through the evening and night. In the morning of 1/6/21, I felt better, but today I still have severe muscle pain in both arms and shoulders and back and neck and I am still fatigued, with some loss of appetite.

I did have a hematoma and bruising, No fever On Jan 1st, I started feeling fatigued again and noticed round reddening approximately 2 inch in diameter appear about a inch under vaccination location which is still bruised.  There is no pain or itching at reddened site. Jan 2, 3 and 4th-Fatigue worsened and developed low grade temp never surpassing 100. My throat developed allergy reaction feeling, same reaction I get with nuts.  Throat did not swell and benedryl managed the reaction on Jan 3rd.  My eyes began swelling and I could not stop sneezing.  Developed laryngitis from the post nasal drainage.   I was up whole night but still went into work as normal on Jan 4th.  Struggled through the days but swelling and itching subsided.    I experienced the muscle aches on the 3rd and 4th. On Jan 5th, started feeling better and rested.  Still have reddened reaction on arm but is fading.  It is faintly visible today on Jan 6th, I feel better, just have the sneezing currently and a mild headache.  Benedryl is the only medication besides daily meds I took during the past several days.  I did not want to interrupt the immune system&#39;s work.

                                                I did let the nurse know right after I got the vaccine It did feel like  a huge water balloon was sitting on my arm and very heavy at the site. I went to the waiting area and the last 5 minutes and I started feeling weird, kind of getting dizzy and my heart started racing really fast. Am I can tell I was getting really hot and my face was flushed and my heart was racing and my hands started shaking, trembling almost like I couldn&#39;t control it. I&#39;ve never experienced something like this. The part that really scared me was my heart racing like it was going to come out of my chest. They called a code, put me in a wheel chair and took me to the ER (where I work).  They took my blood pressure which was really high, they did EKG, blood work and urine test. They kept me there for about five hours, while watching me. And the last weird thing that happened at one point I felt like liquid was running thru my body and my feet were really cold for several hours, It felt like someone was pouring liquid over me. I kept asking the nurse if this is normal and no one knew what to tell me.  After everything started slowing back down and it had been a couple hours and the next day i felt like I had a slight head ache and felt out of it, kind of  like I had a hangover and of course my arm was really sore.  The Doctor in the ER did advise me not to get the second dose as it will be worse than the first one.

A 49-year-old female received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 30Dec2020 10:40 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included from Feb2020 and ongoing she is currently a breast cancer patient/she had breast cancer, has lymphedema in the right due to breast cancer and on 31Oct2020, she tested positive for COVID and that ever since she was positive, her joints and skin, shins and upper arms and legs are really tender, and hips, wanted to know if that is normal.  Had joint pain and fatigue ever since her COVID-19 diagnosis in October. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took H1N1 shot and her arm got really big and they watched for cellulitis discomfort.  The patient stated on Dec2020, &#34;received the COVID-19 vaccine on 30Dec2020 and is reporting 100.7 temperature, dull headache, tenderness at the injection, chills, joint pain and fatigue. She reported that she has had joint pain and fatigue ever since her COVID-19 diagnosis in October. The patient contacted COVID, she tested positive on 31Oct2020, and still has no taste or smell, and the biggest thing right now, that ever since she was positive, her joints and skin, shins and upper arms and legs are really tender, and hips, wanted to know if that is normal. She wants to know, where it has gone into the joint, the arthritis has flared from it, from her testing positive, it will be 9 weeks tomorrow since she had COVID, and she is not 100%, and yesterday she had the COVID vaccine, her first dose, and she was up all night, her joints and muscles were in a lot of pain, but she had been like that, and this morning she took her temperature and it was 101.7. Does it mean can&#39;t have the shot in 3 weeks? She has had health issues this year, she had breast cancer, and her oncologist wanted her to have the vaccine, but it concerns her with all the pain in her joints swelled, and wanted to know if it is a side effect due to COVID. States she is still coughing, she wants to know if Pfizer thought this was a side effect of COVID, since she tested positive in October, will she have to live like that? It is very painful. Her shot went fine at 10:40 yesterday morning, fine, but she has been experiencing stiffness and joint pain, and she contacted COVID in October, thinks this doesn&#39;t have to do with the shot, this has been this way since October, and her husband said to ask- will it be like this since she contacted COVID, and the only thing, this morning she had a headache, but she didn&#39;t sleep and she gets migraines it she doesn&#39;t sleep, and she took her temperature, she felt warm and it was 101.7.

The patient has been sick for three days now. The patient was a &#34;senior&#34; (not clarified) care giver at the nursing home. Everybody at nursing home at the nursing home got the shot and now everybody has cold and sick. She has only one day of work and she has to come into her job to take care of elderly people. As since current everybody is experiencing the terrible adverse, terrible side effects, everything. Fatigue, muscle ache everything.

The patient also stated that they are off of that side effects. They are not interrupted not just the &#34;arm&#34; (not clarified) been there. The patient said she getting everything. She was getting all the side effects. So when they had this Pfizer drug shot &#34;they didn&#39;t get seven days off of&#34; (not clarified) work. If a person gets a shot, they are feeling fatigue, nauseous (incomprehensible voice). They can&#39;t do anything. They should be allowed to stay home from work. Right now everybody in the nursing home is feeling the adverse effect. The entire building. So, she was telling Pfizer to report the report is that all of sudden that the nursing home &#34;seniors&#34; (not clarified) and nurses they got the shot, they can&#39;t even get to work.

A 49-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EK9231)  for COVID-19 immunisation on 07Jan2021 at 15:30 at single dose in Left arm. Medical history included allergy to penicillin , clindamycin, azathioprine (IMURAN) (known allergies: penicillin, clindamycin, Imuran) , allergy to glove powder and autoimmune disorder (unspecified). Concomitant medication (received within 2 weeks of vaccination) included hydroxychloroquine sulfate (PLAQUENIL), methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil (CELLCEPT), folic acid and magnesium. On 07Jan2021 at 17:30 , approximately 2 hours after she received the vaccine, she had a short episode of disequilibrium, then an hour after that (at 18.30) the left side of her face felt heavy, stiff and was palpably warmer than the right side of her face. There were no visible changes to the appearance of her face, and she had normal motor control. This episode lasted for approximately 1-2 hours then gradually diminished. In Jan202, approximately 36 hours after the vaccine, patient was awoken by intense bilateral leg pain. The pain gradually diminished after approximately an hour, but her legs felt weak the following day. Legs were fine on 10Jan2021. In the evening of 09Jan2021 though 10Jan2021, the skin overlying the injection site had an intense prickly &#34;itchy&#34; sensation, there was no rash. Events were all non serious. No treatment administered and final outcome for all the events was reported as recovering.

                                                29 minutes after vaccine was given i felt tingling and numbness on my left cheek and left side of my lips. i informed nurse and she began taking blood pressure and oxygen levels while asking if i was breathing ok.  i said yes. i then felt the right side of my lips go numb.  i felt a faint tightness in my throat but after about two minutes it felt like my right side of the lips started to feel normal and my throat.  then all at once i felt the blood rush from my body and tingling all over. i told the nurse i didnt feel good. she layed me down on the floor and put my feet up. she asked what i was feeling and i said i felt like i was going to faint.  i was aware that my tongue felt heavy and i wasn&#39;t talking clear. another nurse got the allergist or doctor on standby and she asked me what i was feeling. i just rubbed my throat and my cheeks and lips and felt numbness and my throat tight and my tongue very thick. she asked if i was having a hard time swallowing. i nodded so she said they were going to sit me up because they needed to give me an Epipen. i nodded, tgey brought a wheekchair for me and as they helped me stand because i had no strength, a nurse stabbed me with the Epipen then they took me to the emergency room and observed me until 2:30pmish to make sure i didnt have another episode. then i wss discharged and was told to follow up with my primary care doctor within 3 days. An  allergist will also see me to do a skin test.

                                                I received the shot in the morning on Jan. 21, 2021 and had no issues until 12:20am (Jan 22)when I woke up sweating profusely and had major chills.  My body ached all over and had a hard time sleeping due to all of this the entire evening.  I woke up and tried to get ready but quickly realized I was weak, my joints hurt, body ached, headache and couldn&#39;t do it.  This continued throughout the morning and part of the afternoon.  Then around 2pm, I was still tired and achy but my joints didn&#39;t hurt as bad and I was able to manage the headache with ibuprofen.  The body aches continued through most of the next day (Jan. 23) as well.  By Jan. 24th I was perfectly fine and back to normal.  I had covid early in the year on Nov. 6 which kept me out of work for almost 3 weeks.  These few days were very similar to how I felt when I had covid but not as intense.

This 49-year-old female nurse reported for herself that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL8982) at single dose for Vaccination on 14Jan2021. The vaccine was injected to left deltoid/shoulder about 2:15 pm. Relevant medical history included ongoing uterine fibroids since Dec2019, ongoing obesity since Oct2000 and COVID-19 from Dec2020 to Dec2020.   Relevant concomitant drug was unknown. The patient had surgical procedures when she had her first child. No Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s).  Her mother got the shot a couple of days before caller did and she had no problems. The patient was administered her first dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 14Jan2021. She reported that she became sick (Medically significant) about 12 hours later on 15Jan2021.  The patient Went to sleep and woke up about 12 hours after she got the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with a body temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit and arm pain. She could not really go back to sleep. When she got up it went away. She tried to go to work that day, and did go to work but she was really tired. When she finally got home she got in the bed and really had not been out of bed since then except for today she was sitting in a chair; so she thought maybe she had improved a little bit at on the reporting day. She had maintained a constant fever since 15Jan2021 that had gotten as high as 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At the reporting time her temp was 100.5. She had alternated Tylenol and Motrin for the fever. She was sweating profusely so it may be the temperature trying to break, but she had been struggling since she had it. This was so unlike her, she did not just stay in bed. She could not kick it. She had been unable to work since 15Jan2021 and she had to work tomorrow.  She believed this was medically significant because she cannot work.  The patient did not have vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine(s).  No Additional Vaccines was administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Relevant Tests was None. The patient did not visit the emergency Room nor Physician Office due to the events. The outcome of event being sick was resolving. The outcome of event temperature had gotten as high as 103 degrees Fahrenheit was not resolved. The outcome of other events was unknown. The patient thought the causality was yes 100% because her COVID-19 symptoms were not even this bad; she never had a fever with COVID-19; and she had never before had a fever this high for this long.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible chronological association between vaccine administration and onset of the event; causality therefore cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

He found me lying in a pool of blood. Before going to ER in the next 15 minutes, i had an extreme bout of diarrhea. At ER, I learned that I had Broken both my condyals in jaw and fractured lower mandible. At ER and hospital on 2/2, threw up multiple (about 7-8) times, even with anti-nausea drugs in IV. Doctor put an anti-nausea patch behind my ear but not sure if it helped. Had surgery to set it on 2/3/21.

I went to bed under 3 blankets and couldn&#39;t get warm. 5 hours later, the chills went away, but the pain persisted. 3 hours later, I took tylenol for the pain and felt much better 1 hour later.

Most symptoms lasted about 7 -10 days. However, it is now day 20 after the initial vaccine and I still have joint pain that has not gone away. esp in hands, wrists, and feet. When I sleep I still wake up with all my joints hurting it gets better as I start moving but the wrist, hands, and feet pain has not gone away. This pain will wake me in the night when I change positions.  I called my doctor today to inquire if it is a good idea if I should take the second dose because the first dose made me so dibiliated. Awaiting for a response. I am due to take the second vaccine on 2/9/21.

                                                First night had fever (102.4), chills, body aches, fatigue and slight headache. My arm was sore but my armpit was so painful (felt like stabbing sensation).  This lasted until around 2:00 pm Saturday.  I felt ok except for being tired and armpit still hurting quite a bit. On Sunday, I was very tired and slept during the day and went to bed around 8:30 pm feeling like I had a slight sore throat, tired and mildly nauseous. My armpit still hurt quite a bit.  I woke up Monday at 5:30 am and showered and was profusely sweating when I was getting ready for work - my temperature was 100.6 so I took 800 mg of Ibuprofen to help with the temp and the pain in my armpit.  I did not go into work. I  am still tired and my current temp is 100.1 (12:30pm) and sweaty.  I do feel as though the severity of my armpit pain is lessening but it is still bothersome.

                                                Approximately 11 hours after the vaccination my arm became very sore, to the point that it was difficult to lift it.  I then developed body aches and chills.  I did not develop a fever that I know of but the body aches and chills continues throughout the night.  During the night a severe headache developed as well as generalized weakness.  I was unable to sleep and had to miss work the next day.  Because the weakness and body aches continue, I plan to miss a second day of work tomorrow.  I treated the symptoms with Tylenol.

A 50-year-old female patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 (at the age of 50-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included tachycardia, tension headache, and glucose tolerance impaired.  Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), gabapentin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  On 18Dec2020, the patient experienced hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, tetany, muscle cramps, and hemoglobin dropped little bit.  The clinical course was as follows: The patient received the vaccine and about 30 minutes later she started to &#34;feel bad&#34;. She went to the urgent care and about an hour after they took her to the emergency room (also reported as hospital). She had a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and magnesium level done on the 18th, 21th, 23rd, 26th, 28th, 30th of Dec2020 and then again on 04Jan2021.  On 18Dec2020, her initial lab test showed potassium: 2.6, hemoglobin: 10.2, magnesium: 1.2, and calcium: 5.7. The physician assistant reported that a potassium of 2.6 was critically low and a hemoglobin was 10.2 was about normal for the patient. She received oral medications of potassium 20 mEq twice a day and calcium and magnesium supplements once a day. On 04Jan2021, lab data showed:  potassium: 4.2, magnesium: 2.1, calcium: 9.5 and hemoglobin: 14.5. Per the reporting physician assistant, the above levels went back to normal but stated she had to be supplemented to get back to that point. The clinical outcomes of the hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hemoglobin dropped little bit were recovered on 04Jan2021; while that of the tetany and muscle cramps, were unknown. The physician assistant assessed the events as related to the suspect vaccine.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The tightness lasted about one hour, then I began with all over muscle shaking, which lasted about five hours.  I had chills with the shaking, and sat on the sofa with a blanket and heater until the symptoms resided.

Pain progressed over the next 5 days to arm and left eye. Dizziness, mouth drooping, and numbness developed. Went to ED and diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Evaluated in ED for possible causes. Vital signs stable. CVA ruled out. Patient given ketorolac, droperidol, and IV fluids for her headache. Prescribed steroids and acyclovir for Bell&#39;s Palsy treatment. Prescriber instructed patient to return to ED immediately if symptoms worsen or additional symptoms develop. Follow up with patient on 1/5/21 with patient reporting some improvement in symptoms.  Patient reported having a headache for 2 weeks straight prior to presenting to the ED on 1/3/21. Vaccine was administered on 12/28/21. Unsure if the Bell&#39;s Palsy was a result of the vaccine or some other inciting factor.

A 50-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Solution for injection, lot number: EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 23Dec2020 17:20 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the COVID vaccine and was still experiencing soreness in her arm for more than 2 weeks. She wanted to know if she should get the second dose. She also wanted to know if she does get the second dose can she ask for a different needle size and different injection site. She had soreness in her arm on 24Dec2020 and if it was related to the COVID Vaccine. The soreness in her arm is in the left arm where the site of injection was. She noticed when woke up like am in the morning. She had an X-Ray done yesterday 06Jan2021 and it did not show any type of dislocation or fracture. She stated she knew the soreness in the arm was most commonly seen 48 hours after getting the injection, the COVID shot, she knew this was a normal side effect. However, she was wondering why she is still experiencing this and it&#39;s going on 2.5 weeks now. She later clarified when speaking to previous agent they were providing the number to speak to someone more about the side effects and questions. She wanted to know why she was having it more than 2.5 weeks after getting it. She has read literature and she saw there where it can occur, but it indicated it would not be more than 72 hours. She was worried about this. It was causing a decrease in mobility and effecting her mobility. There was no history of all immunizations with the Pfizer Vaccine considered as suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the event soreness in her arm was not recovered, while unknown for the other event.

                                                Received the 2nd shot on 2/11/2021. I started feeling a little &#34;off&#34; later in the evening. I woke up at 0300 with severe joint pain, headache and chills. Nausea started shortly afterwards. The joint pain was excruciating and it was very difficult to move. By 0330, I started vomiting. Vomiting continued until approximately 0745. I felt dehydrated but was not able to hold down any water. I contacted the Nurse Advice line and spoke to a nurse. She asked me a series of questions, all relating to signs indicative of an allergic reaction. I knew I was not experiencing a typical allergic reaction. But I was experiencing a bad reaction. Based on my responses to her questions, she did not recommend that I go an Urgent Care Clinic or see a Doctor. The severe joint pain continued through 02/14/2021. I started to feel better on 02/15/2021. Even though I did not experience an allergic reaction, given the severity of my joint pain and vomiting, I still feel it is important for what I did experience to be documented. Thank you.

                                                Dizziness, that turned into a Syncopal event, resulting in a fall, that resulted in a broken ankle and concussion.   Transported to nearest hospital, I had to have emergency surgery on left ankle, by Dr.  A plate and screws were placed in my ankle to stabilize the break.  I am being treated and monitored by my general doctor for the concussion.  I am currently non-weight bearing on my ankle, for a minimum of 2-4 weeks.  I am unable to work due to the ankle break and concussion, for an undetermined amount of time. I am scheduled to meet with Dr. on the 4th of March, at which time he stated  he will want to begin physical therapy, once the break has reached an adequate stage of healing.  I will be re-evaluated by my general Dr. for the concussion in 2 weeks.

                                                Transcription of a text I sent to my colleagues:  Hi all--I&#39;m not sure who has received the second vaccine, but I wanted to update as to my experience.  I got sick with the first one from about 4ish hours after until the next mid morning maybe?  Then I felt bad again that second night.  I had my vaccine (second) yesterday at 4 PM, and I felt OK going to bed but had a pretty pitiful night.  I woke up at 5 AM and I felt horrible.  That felt like someone took a pair of metal cymbals and slammed them together on my head.  The tinnitus was strong.  I also had body aches and joint pain and felt like I had the flu.  I felt a little better around 1 PM, but felt bad again around 330.  Now I&#39;m miserable again with terrible body aches and chills (this was at 7:38 PM).  I&#39;m sure I will feel better in the morning, just wanted to share my experience.&#34;  Sadly, since then, I have had tinnitus with a metallic ringing in both ears along with hearing loss.  I had some vertigo one day but unsure if this was related.  The tinnitus makes me very sad.  I am a hospitalist and am happy to have been vaccinated, still.  It has been 2 months today, and it remains, unrelenting.  It is worse in the morning and at night.  The hearing loss is difficult.

As treatment, the patient took Tylenol and a Benadryl. The patient also mentioned that she has been extremely tired too. What she meant was she was sitting at her desk at work yesterday and she was nodding off. According to her, it was just offered through work and they went to a hospital to get it.

When clarified if the swelling around eyes was still there, the patient stated that it was not as prominent, it was more around the eyes it&#39;s worse. She further stated that it has improved, she was still tired but the swelling had improved. The patient was also asked regarding the route of administration and she stated that she believes it was long enough to be, it looked like IM, she was not sure.

                                                Day 7 post vaccine, woke with vertigo, nausea and double vision prior to my alarm going off at 5:30am, told my husband that I did not feel right and it felt like something was wrong with me. I asked him to send a message to work that I was not feeling well and would not be in. I was not able to see my phone clearly as I had double vision.  I went back to sleep to try to get relief, woke up and called out to husband for help and he said I was just making groaning noises but I know in my head I was saying please help me as I could not move my right side and I was not sleeping or having a dream. At approximately 9:30am my husband kept telling me someone was trying to text me and needed a response. I tried to get up and still could not move my right side. He helped me sit up and I could not use my right arm and hand. He helped me get some clothes on and took me to the ED. When we arrived I still could not use my right hand and my arm still felt weak. The weakness resolved within a couple of hours and I got the strength back in my hand.   I did have some concern that my TIA type symptoms could possibly be related to vaccine but it was just a thought until I received my second dose. 3 hours post vaccine my face became numb and tingly. It remained that way until I went to sleep. This is why I am reporting this incident.

                                                received my shot at 8:15 am, within approximately  45min I felt a very slight heaviness to my breathing something similar to allergy season belreathing, and a slight headache on my rr temple. This was nothing that stopped me or slowed me down that day.   At approx 10:30pm I awoke from a deep sleep with SHARP chest pains, at 11pm chills, 1am fever and discomfort, 2am muscle aches.  I slept on my left side to keep blood circulating to my heart which seemed to ease some of my discomfort. My first night was rough. I awoke Thurs (12/24) with a swollen left foot and leg. some rt leg pain, joint pain in my left knee. I pushed myself to get up and move and go about my day. Friday, I still had a little left foot foot swelling and pain, knee pain, but kept pushing. The handout says if symptoms persist for longer than 24-48 to seek medical care, I have not.  Friday, (12/25/20)was Christmas and much of the day was non eventful. At approx 530pm. I felt a bulging not in the center of my chest which was tender to the touch. This concerned me. I gently messaged the area, rested a bit but continued to move up and down the stairs. That discomfort and the bulge decreased within a few hours.   Saturday, (12/26) 4:am and I have notice much of the swelling in my foot and legs has decreased, however, I now have bruising. The sore arm is gone, and I am hopefully, all is well. I forgot to mention, I have had intermittent persistent cough with slight sob, something similar to the start of allergy season, but it is brief. I have been coughing at night. I have a history of whooping cough. And gastric bypass.

A 51-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration (left arm), on 08Jan2021 at 12:00, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included stomach flu (about 2 years ago), pneumonia (14 years ago), and oral surgery (recently). Concomitant medications included lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), calcium, ergocalciferol (VIT D) and red yeast rice.

The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The vaccine was administered in the pharmacy or drug store. About 30 min after vaccination on 08Jan2020, the patient&#39;s entire left arm felt &#34;odd&#34; not painful, just different than my right arm.  About 6 hours after the shot, the patient started getting very tired, and my joints/muscles on my left side (neck, leg, arm) started to ache.  She slept off and on from 20:00 to 12:00 and she did not really feel like moving from the couch, but got up to go to bed. She checked for fever around 19:30 and 12:00 but had none. She took one of my left over 600 mg ibuprofen (from a recent oral surgery) as treatment, then went to bed and woke up feeling much better. Today, she only has soreness at the injection site (as she normally did with a flu vaccine). She decided to be proactive and took another 600 ibuprofen around 15:00 and felt consistent all day. Patient stated that how she felt the evening of the vaccine was not painful; just &#34;different&#34; than she experienced before. Outcome of the events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.

Took Tylenol every 4 hrs and fever (101. 5)returns in 1-2 hrs. Pulse ox remained normal, 98%, but pulse was 99/min. Usually my resting pulse ox is 55/minutes.  Was unable to go to work and see patients.  Had these symptoms for 48 hrs even though stayed in bed, took Tylenol around the clock and drank plenty of fluids (2-3 liters of water in addition to natural orange and apple juices). Never lost appetite either, do eating my vegetables and fish diet. Ice cream help between Tylenol?s. Completely resolved after 72 hrs. Now still have  LEFT  injection site tender deltoid and left axillary tender nodes, improving as well. All along breathing fine, no cough or congestion or sore throat. No anosmia  or dysgeusia.  This was after my second Pfizer dose.  After the First dose only had tenderness on the RIGHT deltoid muscle injection site and tender axillary node, resolved by now.

Was given Benadryl and Steiroid. chest x ray given which was normal. EKG taken which was abnormal but told was consistent with an older EKG. Was feeling better and about 90 minutes later felt warmth over my heart, my lips and mouth became tingly and both arms went numb and uncertain if my heart monitor showed abnormal. Was admitted overnight for observation. About 10 hours later had warmth in my chest, heart started beating fast, numbness in arms and around mouth and slight tightness in throat. Benadryl administered and heart calmed after couple of minutes, numbness went away after couple of minutes and tightness in throat went away after an hour.  Again about 13 hours later the warmth in chest and heart racing only symptoms. Given another dose of Benadryl. The symptoms only lasted a couple of minutes.  I also saw a cardiologist who ordered an echocardiogram just to rule out anything with my heart. It was normal.  I was sent home with instructions to use Bendryl oral for 3 days every 12 hours. I was told it could be from vaccine and I was to follow symptoms for 2 weeks and if not better to see cardiologist to look at other reasons.   I have taken the Benadryl for 3 days every 12 hours and did not have any other episodes with my heart.  I am on day 6 now and I have joint pain and headache.

A 51-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200, expiry date: 21Feb2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 17Feb2021 15:40, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2012 to (diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus almost 9 years ago), neuropathy in her feet/nerves and reported that she only turns pink if she gets overheated. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Historical vaccines included influenza vaccine (reported as flu vaccine) which she gets every year and pneumococcal vaccine (reported as pneumonia vaccine) which she gets every 5 years. The patient reported that she received her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 17Feb2021 and had an allergic reaction. She said she was at a podiatry appointment, and her podiatrist told her the pharmacy had an extra COVID-19 Vaccine available. She said the pharmacy staff came to her podiatrist&#39;s office to administer her COVID-19 Vaccine. She said about 5 minutes after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine injection, on 17Feb2021 15:45, her left arm started feeling flushed, her left arm started getting hot, and the hot sensation traveled down her left arm to her left hand, and up to her left shoulder and neck. She said 20 minutes later, she walked from her podiatrist&#39;s office to a nurse&#39;s station to be monitored further. She said while she was at the nurse&#39;s station, a doctor came by twice to evaluate. She clarified the upper part of her left arm started turning pink, and then red. She said her podiatrist asked her if that was a normal reaction for her. She said she told her podiatrist she only turns pink if she gets overheated. She said her left hand got numb and tingly. She said the muscles in her left arm between the inside of her left elbow down to the inside of her left wrist were &#34;twingey&#34;. She said her podiatrist and his nurse felt both her arms, and said her left arm was much warmer than her right arm. While she was at the nurse&#39;s station being monitored, she felt short of breath. She said she wasn&#39;t sure if she was short of breath because of her nerves. She said her oxygen level was checked and it was at 99%. She said her pulse was 101, her blood pressure was 118/76, and her blood glucose finger stick test was 128. She said she was told by the staff monitoring her, she should expect her blood glucose number to skyrocket because there is a steroid in the COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said the staff also mentioned she can expect blood glucose spikes as the COVID-19 Vaccine&#39;s steroid goes through her system. Her fingers in her left hand became itchy while she was at the nurse&#39;s station being monitored. It was a deep down itch in her left hand fingers. She said she asked for an ice pack to put on her left hand because she uses ice packs for neuropathy in her feet, and she felt an ice pack would help with the itch and burning feeling in her left hand fingers. The doctor came to look at her again and wanted to give her IV Benadryl. Then the doctor decided against the IV Benadryl because she would be too sleepy to drive home but the doctor did eventually give her an intramuscular injection of Benadryl 25mg (clarified as Diphenhydramine 25mg in a syringe) in her upper right arm. Within 5 minutes the itching in her left hand fingers calmed down, and the redness in her left arm calmed down to a pink color. She said 20 minutes later her left arm was still pink and warm. She said she was told by the doctor if her reaction moved out of the localized area of her left arm, to go to the Emergency Room, and to use an icepack, again, on her left hand. When she arrived home, her husband said she looked like she had hives and a rash going down her left arm. Her left arm was not itchy though. She clarified the blotchy red marks go in a line from the inside of her top left elbow down to her left wrist. She reported that while she was at her podiatrist&#39;s office her left arm was a solid pink. She then mentioned that when she goes out in the sun and gets overheated, she turns pink. She said from her left shoulder to left elbow was warm to the touch. She said by the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site there is a flush color around the vaccine injection site, but not on the vaccine injection site. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site is sore and her left shoulder is warm to the touch around her COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. She reported there were no blotchy, red marks on her left arm on 18Feb2021. She said her left arm is a pretty normal on 18Feb2021. The nurse who monitored her after the COVID-19 Vaccine shot said she needed to report her allergic reaction. She was told she needs to let the COVID-19 Vaccine staff know of her reaction before she gets her second COVID-19 Vaccine injection, so she can be monitored closely. She took no other treatment after she returned home from receiving her COVID-19 Vaccine. She reported she had a headache on 18Feb2021, clarifying her whole head hurts, and the headache has been persisting all day. She said she experienced tiredness, as well. She said the tiredness started on 17Feb2021 and can be partially attributed to the Diphenhydramine 25mg injection she was given. Her husband told her she looked completely wiped out, and pale when she got home after getting her COVID-19 Vaccine on 17Feb2021. She said she remembers being tired when she got home because her eyes were squinty. She reported feeling more tired on 18Feb2021 and her whole left arm and left hand are sore. She clarified her blood glucose was at 295 when she checked before bedtime of 17Feb2021, and at 185 before breakfast in the morning of 18Feb2021. The patient recovered from the events &#34;her fingers in her left hand became itchy/it was a deep down itch in her left hand fingers&#34; on 17Feb2021; from &#34;upper part of her left arm started turning pink, and then red&#34; and &#34;rash going down her left arm/clarified the blotchy red marks go in a line from the inside of her top left elbow down to her left wrist&#34; on 18Feb2021; from &#34;her left hand got numb and tingly&#34;, &#34;the muscles in her left arm between the inside of her left elbow down to the inside of her left wrist were twingey&#34;, short of breath, &#34;burning feeling in her left hand fingers&#34; and &#34;she looked completely wiped out, and pale&#34; in Feb2021; was recovering from &#34;left arm started feeling flushed&#34;; has not recovered from &#34;her left arm started getting hot, and the hot sensation traveled down her left arm to her left hand, and up to her left shoulder and neck/her left arm was much warmer than her right arm&#34;, &#34;blood glucose was at 295 when she checked before bedtime of 17Feb2021, and at 185 before breakfast in the morning of 18Feb2021&#34;, &#34;there is a flush color around the vaccine injection site, but not on the vaccine injection site&#34;, &#34;Injection site pain/injection site is sore&#34;, &#34;left shoulder is warm to the touch around her COVID-19 Vaccine injection site&#34;, &#34;looked completely wiped out/Tiredness&#34;, &#34;Headache&#34; and &#34;her whole left arm and left hand are sore&#34;.

A 52-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 on left upper arm at a single dose for COVID-19 prevention. Current medical history included a lung disease called asthma and allergies, diagnosed in her late 20&#39;s; Diabetes Type 2, diagnosed about 10 years ago and High Blood pressure, diagnosed when she was in her 30&#39;s. Caller also wanted to include that she did have COVID before, she had COVID in Jul2020. Current concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) at 2 Puffs via inhalation, twice daily for asthma; Unspecified Blood Pressure Medication One pill, once daily by mouth in the morning; Unspecified Nasal Spray 1 spray in each nare, once daily via nasal inhalation; montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) at 1 pill via oral, once a day for allergies; metformin at 1 pill, daily, by mouth for Diabetes Type 2. The patient stated that her place of employment did not give her the card that has the lot number on it, they said they would give it to her with her second injection. The patient did not know the dose received, just that it was the first in the series. The patient had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that her weight on 21Dec2020 when she got the vaccine, was 200.6, but her weight today, was 196.0 pounds. The patient received the vaccine on 21Dec2020, and as soon as she got the shot, her arm was sore like a flu shot. When she got the shot, she could not raise her arm past her shoulder without pain, but now she can raise her arm again. On Thursday, 24Dec2020, patient got a chill, and later that same night, food was not tasting right.  On 25Dec2020, the chill continued, and she had a little bit of a sore throat with a mild cough, like she needed to be clearing her throat. On 26Dec2020 morning, the patient experienced vomiting when she woke up, and the top of her stomach had a bad burning sensation, and she had diarrhea. The patient stated that while she was vomiting, she got choked on some saline and sweat ran down her face, and she had to concentrate on breathing. But the patient stated that she vomited, had diarrhea, and the burning sensation, the whole day on Saturday. The patient stated that on 27Dec2020, it calmed down, and she did not vomit at all. The patient stated that she felt like she needed to vomit, but she did not. The patient states that on Sunday, she still had the chills a little, and the top part of her stomach was still burning. The patient took some Pepto-Bismol and that helped calm down the caller&#39;s stomach. The patient stated that she could feel the Pepto-Bismol cooling her stomach off, like it had been hot, and patient stated that the top of her stomach felt swollen and gassy. The patient stated that later Sunday night, things calmed down, but she still has the burning sensation and she did not feel like she needed to vomit anymore. This morning, patient reported that she still has some burning sensation, but now, it is coming and going like labor pains. The patient stated that she did go to the bathroom once this morning and had diarrhea that was like liquid-y water. The patient stated that during all this over the last few days, each and every time that she tried to eat, she couldn&#39;t eat much because her stomach would burn more with eating. But yesterday, the patient had some fried fish and stated that the fried fish did not burn as much as the rest of the food she tried eating. The outcome of the events vomiting and the top of her stomach felt swollen and gassy was recovered on 27Dec2020, arm was sore and could not raise her arm was recovered on 26Dec2020, chills, top of her stomach had a bad burning sensation was recovering, Diarrhea/had diarrhea that was like liquid-y water was not recovered and other events was unknown.

                                                Exactly 12 days after the vaccine I reported a fine rash with small blisters covering the backs of both of my hands with itching and warm redness in them both (I have pictures) Within an hour it began feverish red itching and slight burning on both of The undersides of my forearms. I was advised by the pharmacists on duty in the covid clinic site to use topical Benadryl cream and or take Benadryl by mouth if it worsened. I was told to seek emergency dept help if any signs of breathing issues presented. The next morning the itching was gone the redness subsided and the rash was markedly better but still raised in the tops of my hands.  By 1030am on 1/12/21, I could not detect taste or smell at all. I was advised then to report to employee healthline for further instruction. I was told to leave work and proceed to our employee Covid swab testing drive thru facility for Covid testing and remain home for results the following morning on 1/13/21. At approximately 10am 1/13/21 I was confirmed positive for COVID-19 via the swab results. I was told to quarantine and given a return to work date of 1/24/21 as long as my symptoms were resolved.  I am currently in home quarantine still suffering no taste or smell, muscle cramps in legs, thighs and back. Fatigue, Loss of appetite, sinus pressure and headache not relieved with medications.

A 52-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), Batch/lot number: EK9231, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021, via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 09:00 at single dose in deltoid right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart attack from Jul2019. Concomitant medication included diltiazem from 2019 and ongoing at 120mg tablet taken daily for abnormal heart rhythm she did not know of until had heart attack, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) from 2019 and ongoing at 81 mg tablet taken daily for heart attack. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunisation; she got the Flu vaccine every year and got shingles vaccine in Mar2020 for immunization. She did totally fine after receiving Flu vaccines and the Shingles vaccine. She had no side effects from the Flu vaccines except maybe a little arm soreness; she had arm soreness for a couple of days after the shingles vaccine; maybe a slight fever and took it easy. This Emergency Room Nurse (patient) received her second dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 06Jan2021 around 9:00am. She went back to work, worked around 6-8 more hours that day and was fine. She went home and around 8-10 hours after she got the second dose on the evening of 06Jan2021 she had a little arm soreness and body aches. Last night all night she had chills; she could not sleep; fever. This morning: 07Jan2021 she was so nauseous that she got up and tried to get to the bathroom where she threw up a little. She reported as of 07Jan2021 she kept falling down: She fell in the bathroom this morning first when she was trying to get to the bathroom to throw up; During the second fall she was going on the stairs and fell, and hit her head; she had a huge bump on her face that was very painful now that she thought was from that second fall; and she had the third fall this evening; she cannot walk straight or without assistance anymore, she had been on the couch all day. She has had vertigo all day and weakness in the muscles. Chills was described as unbearable, heavy chills that she could not control. Fever: Temperature of 102-102.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The high fever hit around 3:00am on 07Jan2021. When her high fever hit around 3:00am she thought she would go to the emergency room but she did not want to scare her family so she stayed home and tried to pull through it. Today she took a Tylenol after she threw up this morning just to get through the day. Since she cannot walk without assistance or walk straight today that&#39;s the only lingering symptom that really worries her; she may go to the emergency room tonight if she did not get any better. She just did not want to scare her family and the emergency room was another copay cost so she really did not want to go to the emergency room at her workplace; but she may go there tonight and be kept overnight under observation. Prior to taking this second dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she was completely fine. She expected to have body aches, chills and fever; but she never thought the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine would put her into a place where she is falling like this with the nausea and vertigo; she has never in her life had vertigo or falling like this. She reported she had no other vaccinations on the same date as Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine second dose. Has had no other vaccines in the recent past. She had never felt like this before with any other vaccines; she had never felt so weak in her muscles and never fallen down like this with any other vaccines. Seriousness criteria and outcome of all events unknown. The reporter considered all events were related to Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

                                                2 days past vaccination shoulder pain started. Pain is burning and sharp in nature and radiate from the top of the shoulder to occasionally near the back shoulder blade. Range of motion is affected as it is painful to reach backwards or straight out laterally. Taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen every 6-8 hours to help ease burning sensation. Not always completely helps.

                                                after the first vaccine shot my muscles started aching with general fatigue. this lasted about a day and felt like it came and went very quickly. the injection site was still hard and edematous after about 2 weeks.  After the second vaccine I became slightly achy the same day I got the shot but pre-emptively took ibuprofen, which worked well.  it wasn&#39;t until the day after my shot (towards the end of my work day) that I became incredibly fatigued and muscles ached.  Later in the evening I developed a sore throat and slight cough, I did not take my temperature but felt I had a slight temperature increase.  the 2nd and 3rd day post shot I was incredibly fatigued with a slight sore throat.  by 4th day post shot I was feeling back to my normal self.

A 52-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine), intramuscular in the left arm on 12Jan2021 at 16:30 as a single dose to prevent COVID. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported and it was reported that she had no relevant medical history. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Dec2020 at 14:00. The patient did not receive any other vaccine/s on the same date as BNT162B2, did not have prior vaccination within four weeks of receiving BNT162B2, and did not experience any adverse event following prior vaccinations. The patient experienced mild fatigue and myalgia on 13Jan2021, and lymphadenopathy on 14Jan2021. Seriousness for the events was reported as serious (medically significant). The patient received her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 12Jan2021 at 16:30. She experienced mild fatigue and myalgia after 24 hours which has improved. She clarified that the mild fatigue and myalgia resolved by this morning. She felt lymphadenopathy in her lower neck and supraclavicular area. Stated it was almost fullness she can feel, there was no redness and it was not tender. She was hoping this was related to the vaccine that she got in her left upper arm. She went to the CDC and Pfizer website and saw that lymphadenopathy was mentioned but it was a small percentage. The patient declined any treatment. The events did not require a visit to the Emergency Room of Physician&#39;s office. Outcome of the events fatigue and myalgia was recovered on 15Jan2021, while for the event lymphadenopathy  was not recovered. The reporter&#39;s causality assessment between the events and BNT162B2 for the events fatigue and myalgia was related, while for the event lymphadenopathy was unknown.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association and drug&#39;s safety profile, the events fatigue, myalgia and lymphadenopathy are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 52-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal asthma diagnosed when she was a child and has a rescue inhaler she only uses once in a while if she needs it; she stated her thyroid was giving her problem, she takes a thyroid medicine; and stated weight was thanks to menopause. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), fish oil (OMEGA 3), and curcuma longa (TURMERIC). The patient reported that she was aggravated and upset on an unspecified date. She reported that she was not feeling bad before taking the shot and nobody was telling her what to do about it. She was asking what she should do about her symptoms of joint pain, restless leg syndrome and fatigue after getting her first vaccination on 22Dec2020. She was crying and stated that her boss can&#39;t tell her anything, she doesn&#39;t want to go to her doctor because, what was he going to tell her. She doesn&#39;t want to waste a copay. She reported taking Advil and Tylenol for her joint pain without relief and asked what else she should do. She stated she wanted directions, she doesn&#39;t want people reading off of a card. She stated she shouldn&#39;t have to pay a copay and she doesn&#39;t want more medicine to mask her symptoms, she wanted an answer. Additionally, the patient was calling about Pfizer COVID shot, she took first dose 22Dec2020, had a reaction, 35 minutes after she sat for 30 minutes, she works at a hospital, and she walked out to her car, she got sick and nauseous, then after the shot, she had flu like symptoms that lasted, and the next day was terrible, it lasted another week and a half, then she took the second shot 11Jan2021, to this day, she still has restless leg syndrome, fatigue, and her joints were hurting her. She had the same thing before, but this hurts a lot worse, and it was not going away, she was taking Turmeric, everything, and everyone says to just keep taking Tylenol or Advil but she can&#39;t keep taking it because now it was upsetting her stomach, or like arthritis medicine, she was taking Omega 3, vitamins, she was 52 years old, she does Spartan races, Cross fit, she does paleo and keto eating, if one looks at her they wouldn&#39;t know she was 52, and she was hurting everyday and doesn&#39;t know what else do to, and doctors weren&#39;t knowledgeable, she doesn&#39;t want a stupid answer. She called work, the CDC knows about it, now VAERS, and they said to call Pfizer, when she calls her doctor she doesn&#39;t want to pay a copayment and get an idiotic answer. She got this because she works at a hospital and she was trying to protect herself and everyone else, she doesn&#39;t like feeling this way, it was to the point she was getting angry, not at Pfizer, but she gets up and runs, with her dog, she was busy all the time, she has 3 boys in the military, and she meets up to do obstacles with them, but she doesn&#39;t feel like doing crap and was miserable everyday. She was a CNA in nursing school. She doesn&#39;t know if she even wanted to see her doctor, she doesn&#39;t want to get an idiotic answer. She hasn&#39;t seen him in while, she switched insurance, been primary for years. Stated this was her first day speaking to DSU before she decides what else to do after this, she was angry. Stated about 35 minutes after the first shot, after 30 minutes they said she could go, she said ok, she walked out to her car, was nauseous and threw up and didn&#39;t eat that morning, and the next day, she felt like she was in a car accident, that was how bad she felt, she had cold chills, flu like stuff that night before, she runs low like 96.6 to 96.8 and she took her temperature, she got in a blanket and went to bed that night, she was 95.5, and didn&#39;t bother taking another temperature, she took a bunch of Advil and went to bed, and Benadryl to go to sleep. This all started on 22Dec2020, and it took about 2 weeks, she just had joint pain, not like now, but those days she didn&#39;t feel good, but by the third week she was ok, and she went to take the second shot next time, and all hell broke loose. The second shot was 11Jan2021, and that night it she noted her joints were starting all over again, and she had restless leg syndrome, cold chills and everything, so she went to bed, she didn&#39;t have Benadryl, so she got up, and that night took Tylenol, she didn&#39;t get very much sleep, and she was very annoyed the next day, she felt like the first time, that like she got it an accident, feeling terrible, that night, and she can lay on the couch to relax, but with the restless leg syndrome, and her joints all day long, she just went yesterday to buy Advil Arthritis, and she never had arthritis before or anything. Restless leg syndrome depends, sometimes it was better than other time. Joint pain was not improving, she was so aggravated about that, she was not feeling 100%, people look at her and say she doesn&#39;t look like she feels good, she doesn&#39;t, and she was ready to bite their heads off, she was very active, always in the gym or something, she has 3 kids in the military, and was always meeting up with them to do military runs and just this was ridiculous. Stated she took a picture of the vaccine card, as she sent it to a few people. This was definitely the Pfizer vaccine, she has told many people, many people know do not take this, she was so irritated, it&#39;s not even funny. The case was reported as non-serious. The outcome was not recovered for the events joint pain, restless leg syndrome and fatigue; and unknown for the rest of the events.

She felt like the first time that like she got it an accident, feeling terrible that night, and she can lay on the couch to relax but with the restless leg syndrome, and her joints all day long. She just went yesterday to buy Advil Arthritis, and she never had arthritis before or anything. She mentioned that the restless leg syndrome outcome depends, sometimes it is better than other time, as for the joint pain, it was not improving, she is so aggravated about that, she is not feeling 100%, people look at her and say she doesn&#39;t look like she feels good (she doesn&#39;t) and she is ready to bite their heads off since she is very active, always in the gym or something. She started Turmeric since she is desperate, this has been going on since 11Jan2021, anything she is doing now is not doing anything. She does not know what to do as every doctor will say maybe she should see this doctor, but she didn&#39;t feel like this before this shot. She was tired of feeling this way, she didn&#39;t feel this way before the shot, and if anyone met her, they know it. The outcome of the event restless leg syndrome was recovering, arthralgia was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                Significant burning with admin of first shot. Approx 3.5 hours after shot I could not move my arm at the shoulder.  This was more than muscle soreness but being unfamiliar with Covid vaccine, I just rode it out. This lasted 2 days.  Since then, my shoulder joint has not been the same with sl limited ROM and persistent pain.   This improved signif over the 3 weeks until my 2nd Covid vaccine 1/7/21.  This is what tipped me off that the first shot was not correct.  #2 did not burn at all with administration or cause any limited ROM.  Typical deltoid soreness sl more than a tetanus shot, and general &#34;flu like sxs&#34; that lasted &lt; 24 hours.

                                                I received the Covid vaccine. The injection itself was without any issues. However, 6-7 hours later, my entire upper arm began aching-pain from my trapezius down to my elbow. This continued throughout the weekend and then Monday, my index and middle finger began tingling (as if asleep). This symptom has never subsided. I am noting pain in each of the major joints of my arm-shoulder, elbow and wrist. I have tired trigger injections in my trapezius, ibuprofen, muscle relaxers, heat, exercises, a steroid burst-all without relief of symptoms. I am able to move my arm and I do have strength in the extremity. I have seen a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation. What I believe may have triggered this reaction is that in October I had a radial and ulnar tunnel release in the same extremity. I wonder whether the medication has affected the nerves that had been manipulated during surgery. I am wondering if anyone participating gin the trial had recent surgery was well? if so, did they note any complication after receiving the vaccine. Any help you can give would be appreciated. Thanks you for your time.

She confirmed that on 07Jan2021, she had a Rapid test for COVID, and the results came back the same day, as Positive. She was told that she should also have a 48-hour test, so she had that performed as well, and that one also came back positive, but she knew it would, because by then she had lost her taste and smell.

She was told she needed to wait 30 days from her positive diagnosis before she could get the 2nd dose. She added that she will still be in isolation when her 2nd dose is due. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Redness, pain, and swelling at injection site that has continued to worsen even after 48 hours.  Could not perform regular activities of daily living. I could not drive home from work the day after the injection because the adverse reactions were getting more severe, especially after the 24 hour mark.   Treatment: treated my symptoms at home with medications (I am a nurse),  after researching possible adverse reactions. I figured there was not anything someone else would to treat me besides treat my symptoms.

Mild lower back pain that evening (vaccine on left arm and pain on same side). On 12/30 soreness was only to palpation. Rhinorrhea all day long, took NyQuil, moderate back pain, took naproxen and did some back stretches.  On 12/31 no sore arm but little tender. Increased back pain , used back brace , took naproxen  not that much help  though. used heat pack  finally fall asleep around 3 am. on 01/01/2121 around 6 am woke up with excruciating left lower back pain, could not move, get off the bed. took a while to get off the bed. Have to drag my legs very slowly to walk. Went to ER. X-ray did not show anything.  In ER took Narco 5 and Baclofen. MD thinks that it might not be side effects of vaccine. But I wonder,  I never had left lower back pain before. Taking Baclofen and Advil TID since 0101/2021.  01/04 still in pain. increase pain after 6-7 hours after meds. Sitting or standing more than 30 mins Increases pain. Going to see PMD today

                                                Fever began on 24th around 10 with chills. Took Tylenol for low grade fever about 12:30 pm. Subsided for 6 hours and then 6:30 that evening it returned at 100.7. Again 6 hours later, fever was 100.4.  Christmas day, still had fever around 100. Then again that afternoon. Lymph node swelling underneath the arm. The site of the injection I had a large knot. Very swollen, small bruise, hot, and red. No streaking or red lines. Lymph node underneath the arm was about the size of a ping pong. I did not want to go to the ER. I called the nurse line and was triaged over the phone. I was instructed to take BP and pulse and gave numbers over the phone. BP was a little elevated, but nothing to extreme. I pretty much stayed laying down. It sucked the life out of me. I used hot compress and cold compress on site of the injection. It was late Saturday evening when I decided to see a change in the size of the lymph node. By Sunday, the 27th, there was no fever. Not even on Saturday. By Sunday, the lymph node had subsided as well.  I did get a headache, but it was like a nagging headache. My left shoulder in the muscle area towards the neck area, I had soreness.

                                                One week after the vaccine I was find until....I got out of my car after driving and started staggering and could not function.  Severe dizziness, heavy headedness , nausea and vomiting and a horrible headache.  My husband had to physically muscle me back to my car. He wanted to take me to the ER and I would not let him because of the waiting room is full of COVID positive patients.  I threw up along the way home and multiple times to the point I had drive heaves.  I am a Registered Nurse and felt the symptoms I were experiencing were Vertigo.  I had one bout with Vertigo in 2015 and it was extreme.  I had Meclizine on hand and and took one tablet and slept.  The severity of this was so bad I could not walk unassisted or sit up without falling over. After 6 hours of sleeping I got up, dizziness continued, and vision a little off.  I still do not feel 100% I have had a headache since.  It never dawned on me this could be from the vaccine I had taken a week before.

And neck pain... cervical radiculopathy in the L arm... pain and pins/needles into L thumb. It reached its peak with 4 nights of disturbed sleep starting on the date mentioned. I didn?t keep track of the symptoms other than that because I didn?t initially associate the symptoms to the vaccine until early this week. Symptoms have since improved and are (almost) resolved; I was advised to have the the 2nd vaccine today as scheduled - which was recommended lower on the deltoid and on the opposite shoulder.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 08Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 54-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in deltoid left on 29Dec2020 07:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing sleep apnoea (diagnosed about 3-4 years ago, wear her CPAP religiously), Hashimoto&#39;s hypothyroid, and chronic low vitamin d (lack of sunlight). Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from 2016 and ongoing for Hashimoto&#39;s hypothyroid, ergocalciferol (VIT D) from 2018 for chronic low vitamin d; lack of sunlight (She did not take it religiously, but was supposed to take it everyday). At 10:30 AM (29Dec2020), she started to get cold and shake. She thought that this was insane and it was in her head. It became so severe she could not use her computer her hands were shaking so hard. She went back up to where they were giving vaccines, they took her temperature and it was 100. It had been normal the morning before she got the vaccine. Her heart rate was elevated at 100. They put a blanket on her and said they wanted to watch her for 15 minutes. In that time her fever went to 101 and her heart rate was 110. They took her to the ER. She was there for 5 hours. Her heart rate went to the high 120s. They did a 12 lead EKG. Her temperature had gone to 102.6, which was the highest. They gave her a liter of Normal Saline. She also had a headache, backache, and felt nauseated. The liter of fluid helped, no doubt. She was not admitted. She was wiped out the next day (30Dec2020) with aches and pains still. Their concern was they said they did not give her epinephrine because her heart was too high. She had no breathing issues. Just extreme cold. At one point she had woke up in the ER (29 or 30Dec2020) and her chest was hurting, she knows from her heart rate being too fast. She was so cold. She had on 6 blankets. The next day (30Dec2020) she still had the aches and pains, she was tired, and had brain fog. It all went away on 30Dec2020. She had nothing after that. What scared her was the heart rhythm. The ER doctor says its not great, but felt that getting the second dose was better than her having COVID. The Electrophysiologist she saw, said she was unsure if she should get the second dose. The hospital said that for this next dose, they would give her the injection, wait 15 minutes, then send her home, expecting that she would have the same thing happen. When after the first dose, she was in the ER on a 12 lead EKG with an intravenous (IV). She had no arm pain the whole time. The reporter assessed all events related. She felt fine prior, walking in to get the vaccine. But she was much better the next day and recovered completely. She was just worried about the second dose. The outcome of events was recovered on 30Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the drug&#39;s known safety profile, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I waited for 30 minutes; I walked to my car and didn&#39;t feel well; I thought maybe I was hungry I ate 1/2 banana and drank some water. I started to drive home.  It felt like a huge cold railroad spike was being driven up the top of my shoulder to my neck, it was a cold sensation anteriorly and posteriorly on my neck.  Then my face (left side) started to go numb, it started just about the top of my left ear and went all the way to my lips. It stopped midline.  It felt like a dental block.  I could still swallow and breathe.  I started shaking, felt nausea, my upper esophageal sphincter started to spasm.  I kept checking my tongue and airway to see if I should pull over and call 911.  I drove to the ER.  My left side of face was numb, I was trembling, tremoring.  They gave me small dose of IV Bendadryl (12.5 mg) and Pepcid, I slowly started to feel better and the feeling came back to my face moving from midline lip to cheek.  It still felt &#34;funny&#34; but much better.  I was in the ER for around 2 hours. I have had more tremoring since my vaccine in my neck and hand (I do have primary essential tremors but it is tremoring much more now) and more neck pain (could be due to the increased tremors)

I felt perfect as I did with the first vaccine until I woke at midnight with a high fever , diarrhea, severe fatigue and muscle aches. Hard for me to move or walk. Needed assistance from husband to get to the bathroom. The symptoms lasted until approximately 9 am. Then I felt tired but fine. Today I feel tired but no symptoms. Back to normal.

I woke up again at 6:30 with the same horrible headache not relieved at all by Maxalt so I took another dose. I had vertigo so I went back to bed. I woke up at 8:00 still with the horrible headache and vertigo but had horribe nausea. I never vomited. I felt weak all day, had no appetite and my neck felt very stiff all day. In the evening my knees were aching. The next day I continued to have a mild headache and neck stiffness.

                                                On Sunday, January 17, 2021 I started having severe joint pain in my wrists, elbows, knees, hips and shoulders. Along with aching all over. Over the course of the day, I started to feel bad. Then on Monday January 18, 2021, in addition, to the joint pain, I started feeling disoriented, dizzy like spells of vertigo.  I went to my PCP who did lab work and all was normal. He said it muse be delayed reaction to the vaccine. Later in the day, I was having difficulty putting words together and more dizzy and very lethargic. I laid down and slept until the next morning. (Tuesday 1/19/21) On Tuesday 1/19/21, they symptoms were improved but still had some dizziness. On Wednesday 1/20/21, the symptoms have improved except for an occasional dizzy spell.

                                                Two hours after the injection  both of my leg seized. The muscles so tight that I was unable to walk (like a spasm). There was no twitch the a muscular contraction that left me unable to walk properly (the left side seem to be the tightest side of by body) .   I also had bilateral jaw pain  (not sure if its was because I was in so much pain in the legs that I was clenching my teeth) I also  had slight numbness on by left face and by the evening I had redness on my left cheek but it went away.   My face still has a bit of muscle sensitivity (tingling sensation) near the mouth and jaw.

I had positive Covid-19 and I was having some of those symptoms- very painful headache, terrible lower back pain , very tired, upset stomach and sore at injection site. I couldn&#39;t get comfortable . I started taking 3 Tylenol ES, Ibuprofen 800mg, and Pepto Bismol at same time every 4 hours. After about 18 hours I started feeling normal. The testing site told me some people are having reactions.

                                                Dizziness and weakness; Numbness and tingling; Other ADVERSE REACTION Reported: Electrolyte imbalance requiring hospitalization for More than 48 hours with repeated hematology follow up.  Patient is a 54-year-old woman with history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and some alcohol abuse who presented to the hospital with fatigue, headache, muscle cramps and weakness.  She also had a slight fever that followed her 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine.  She had basic lab work which revealed pancytopenia along with multiple electrolyte disturbances including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia and hyponatremia.  She admits that she had heavy alcohol use over the weekend with binge drinking of liquor.  She otherwise does drink a couple of mixed drinks a night.  She has also been trying to lose a lot of weight.  She says that she lost about 60 lb in the last 6 months on purpose.  She is doing this so that she can have a panniculectomy and tummy tuck.  She recently had a breast reduction in November.  She has not been following with a dietitian or having her vitamin levels checked.  Despite having pancytopenia, her levels remained pretty stable during her stay.  She had a peripheral smear sent which was pending at the time of discharge.  She was also checked for vitamin deficiencies.  She is given a dose of IM B12, IV iron, IV calcium and started on oral calcium vitamin-D supplements.  She does take a daily multivitamin.  Due to her reported history of heavy alcohol use she is also given thiamine and folate.  After speaking with Hematology, recommendations were for her to have a follow-up appointment which is scheduled on February 10th.  I also put in a referral for a dietitian to evaluate her for further recommend deficiencies in the setting of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery with heavy weight loss.  I prescribed her calcium vitamin-D along with folic acid.  I recommended she continue her multivitamin.  I also recommended that she abstain from alcohol use.

                                                I had my 2nd does of the Pfizer vaccine on February 27, 2021.  The next morning  I awoke with a very bad headache.  I took and Advil.  My husband was making breakfast.  I came downstairs, ate, had a cup of coffee, then got a glass of water and an ice pack and sat on a recliner in the living room.  I don&#39;t remember much of the rest.  It was like a dream.  My husband said I let out a yell, my arms flailed and my eyes were very strange.  I lost muscle strength in my lift side mimicking a stroke.  He called 911.  I was taken to Emergency facility where I gained consciousness.  I was then transferred to Hospital.  So far every test has come back negative.  I have an EEG scheduled for this Thursday.

                                                increased AFib episodes; joint ache esp to left knee with pain; Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 54-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration at arm left on 28Jan2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 54-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib), depression, aortic stenosis and allergy to sulfa, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included losartan, HCTZ, sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), vitamin D3, magnesium and cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12).  The patient previously took LEVOQUIN and prednisone and experienced allergies. On 02Feb2021 at 08:00, the patient experienced increased AFib episodes, joint ache esp. to left knee with pain and headache.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 (nasal swab) test: negative on 22Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included acupuncture and the events required physician office visit. The patient outcome of the event was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event atrial fibrillation is related to BNT162B2.  The event only occurred 4 days after vaccination.  And the patient had underlying atrial fibrillation, which is considered the most likely cause of the reported event.

                                                On March 16, I was sitting in a chair next to my kitchen counter when I felt like my body was being thrown.  My head was thrown forward and I hit the counter hard and sustained a large contusion above my left eye.  The room was spinning and I was dizzy for the next few hours.  I never lost consciousness but had no control of my body for the few seconds of the episode.  The episode was sudden and violent and I was just sitting when it happened.   I spoke with my physician who diagnosed me with having experienced a Tumarkin otolithic crisis.  He has instructed me to wear a helmet and not to leave my home.  He is also recommending that I have a labyrinthectomy to treat the symptoms.  While I have a history of vertigo, I have not had any dizziness for more than a year.   I now feel dizzy on and off most of the day.

I broke my wrist last year and the ache in that wrist was awful. Motrin helped but this persisted throughout the day. General feeling of being unwell for the whole day and evening. The second day after the shot I woke up feeling better but in my armpit on the arm I received the shot it felt like I had a lump in my arm pit and it is sore. This is still there today, the third day after the shot.

                                                After getting out of the bathtub as I was reaching for my towel, A VERY SUDDEN ONSET of severe weakeness hit me and I had to sit on toilet.  I was unable to move my arms or legs  for 20 minutes, then was able to get up but walked VERY WOBBLY AND WEAK to my bed just a few feet away.  I collapsed on my bed and turned my fan blowing on me directly. {Im NEVER hot, usually cold ALL the time}.  I layed there so weak I could barely move for another 20 to 30 minutes.  I thought I was having a stroke honestly and my thoughts were about my doors being locked so nobody could get in to help me and my phone was in the living room and for that time period I WAS TOTALLY UNABLE to go get it.  THANKFULLY, after about 45 minutes total, all symptons went away and I returned to my baseline mobility.  Im very grateful that this was not a stroke as I thought. but I do believe it may have been a reaction to the vaccine.  I did not notify any physicians yet, and as of this writing Im perfectly fine, Thank the Lord.

Today, Day 3-1/13/21,My skin still feels numb and less, and the tingling in my left thigh is no longer present. dx&#34;paresthesia,&#34; no other concerns as it has not affected my movement or ability to work.

                                                During the early morning following my second Covid vaccination, I started having fever and chills, muscle aches, and a headache. I woke up about 230 am and my stomach was hurting.  I thought I would have to have a bm in a little while but was able to go back to sleep.  About an hour and a half later, I again woke up with stomach pain, maybe some bloating.  I decided to go into the bathroom and I sat on the floor beside the toilet and began vomiting.  I vomited 5 times and had one dry heave.  The vomitus was clear in color, thin with some small pieces of food.  I had felt very hot before vomiting, but was unable to check my temperature due tp nausea and vomiting.  I checked my temperature a little while later and it was 100.2 F.  I was able to go back to sleep for a while and kept checking temperature during the day.  It was between 99.1 and 99.8 for most of the day.

I was unable to move my hands or feet. My fingers were frozen so hard that my husband could not even close my hand for me. My tongue felt thick and I was having difficulty speaking. Husband picked me up off the floor and carried me to our bed. We were getting ready to call 911 when my feet began to wake up and the rigidity subsided for all areas. Epidsode lasted appx 15 mins.

And it occurred within the 24 hrs post vaccine and continues to persist. I felt feverish and had myagia for a day which settled with Ibuprofen. However I  also developed right middle metatarsal inflammation and joint swelling with pain which is ongoing.   thought it will settle down., but still persisting  for 6 days currently.

Still continuing but not as severe as the first 48 hours. Body aches, particularly (but not only)  right hip and knee that have arthritis- worst sx ~ 36 hours post vaccination.  Ongoing intermittently. Heart palpitations but unable to determine if related to vaccination. Chest pain, mid-left sternal, intermittent, ongoing.  More of a muscular pain/discomfort.

So really severe chills. When i got home i got under heated blanket then I started getting itchy and noticed hives all over body. then I started getting blisters on palms of my hands and they were like water blisters. I was uncontrollably itchy. I started looking up online  what to do and asked friends and family and started taking Benadryl.  I had to take it for 4-4.5 days so then the hives finally went away but I was still itchy. I&#39;ve just been very very exhausted and been having to push myself to get up. I had anxiety about getting  the vaccine but I decided to get it. I still don&#39;t feel like myself, I don&#39;t have much of an appetite but not losing weight because I&#39;ve been forcing myself to eat. I&#39;m taking vitamins and praying I feel better but I just don&#39;t feel like myself. I don&#39;t have as much energy and exhaustion is the big thing. My joints started hurting really bad.

                                                Chills; Enlarged lymph nodes; Body aches in her back and shoulders; Body aches in her back and shoulders; fever of 99.6/low grade; Sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 55-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 08Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included urinary tract infection (UTI) from 06Jan2021 and ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), in the left upper arm with no issues. At first, she just had a sore arm on 08Jan2021. Then this morning, on 13Jan2021, she was having chills, enlarged lymph nodes, body aches in her back and shoulders, and a fever of 99.6. It is low grade but does not take much. She has been checking her temperature every 4 hours and it is not any different. She was taking paracetamol (TYLENOL) for a few days to ward anything off. Today (13Jan2021), she laid off the paracetamol to see if she really did have a fever. She did not want to mask it. So, she is taking paracetamol for that off and on. She talked to one person who said the symptoms should last 1-2 days. Then another person said they could last up to a week. She hopes that it is related to the vaccine. She will be mad if she gets COVID after doing all of this. Outcome of the sore arm was recovered on 09Jan2021 and of the remaining events was not recovered.

                                                Since the 1st shot, I have experienced  a sudden onset and increasingly worsening pain in my left wrist.  The immediate reaction at the time of the shot was strong tingling in my left arm. The next day, I felt sore all over my body, as well as cold/flu like symptoms for 2 days.  But the wrist pain has been getting worse, and consistent.   I broke that wrist 10 yrs  ago, and may have some slight work related carpel tunnel.   With that in mind, I can say that the current issues and pain I?m dealing with have been acute and severe since I received the first dose of the vaccine.  I just received the second dose 3 days ago, and still my wrist is hurting.  I am careful to make sure I don?t put too much weight on it, and often wear a wrist brace.  I am currently waiting to see my primary care doctor to seek medical attention.

Approximately 2 pm the day after injection, began feeling overly hot and nauseated. That was followed by pressure type headache, muscle/bodyaches, and overall feeling of no energy progressing as the afternoon and evening continued. Spent that evening sleeping on/off. The following day spent in bed with continued headache, body/muscle aches, feeling overall drained/ no energy.  Nausea improved some; was able to stomach some soup later in the day.  So far today, feeling  some improvement with bodyaches, but overall drained of energy. Headache has lightened some as well.

Approximately 2.5hrs later developed generalized muscle aches, tired, chills.  Next morning muscle aches were less, new headache and dizziness. took Tylenol which helped, about 5 hrs later symptoms worsened, improved with sleep and Tylenol.   Awoke this morning with some chest pain similar to initial response, some headache and dizziness, improved with Tylenol,  now returning (noon).  occasionally feels like I need to take a deep breath.  I believe its mostly muscular pain gets a little worse with deep breathing.  Sent home from work day of vaccine, worked partial days next 2 days

Her husband and I walked her over to the cot and medical treatment area. Her pulse felt thready and weak while walking and her gait was unsteady. As soon as she sat, then lay on the cot she lost consciousness and did not respond to verbal or noxious stimuli over the next few minutes. I gave her one dose of an epi-pen into her left mid outer thigh but she still did not regain consciousness so we called a &#34;Rapid Response code&#34; for transport to the E.R. for further treatment and stabilization.

                                                From the evening of the day I have received the vaccination, my left arm started to feel dull continuous pressure pain, progressed stronger and stronger as the time goes.  No treatment given.  Following day, the pain was worse and stayed same.  The IM insertion site was also painful to touch or pressure.  Then afternoon of the same day, I started nausea, light headache, dizziness, and occasionally chills  as well as occasional dry cough accompanied by itchy throat or without itchy throat.  At this point, I took Advil 200mg 1 tab around 3pm.  The muscle pain on my left arm and headache is eased but other symptoms stayed same at this time, 4:30pm.

A 56-Year-old female consumer (patient) reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1686), via unspecified route at left upper arm on 12Jan2021 about 9:15am at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type was hospital. Medical history and concomitant drugs were not reported. Weight: 175-180 lbs. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Past drug included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) been using the product more than 10 years and never had a problem with it, she didn&#39;t think that was related to her experience. Patient received first vaccine yesterday 12Jan2021. 45 minutes after receiving vaccine (12Jan2021 10 AM), she developed hot flashes in sternum (flushing sensation in her sternum or upper chest area. It was like when she had a dye injected), anxiety, dizziness/ light headedness, muscle weakness, significant dissociation, depersonalization, shakey, mild nausea, arm pain. The patient explained that this was why she was in the MRI scanner (Jan2021). This came a couple of times yesterday and had not been experienced this today (13Jan2021). It (dizziness) was ongoing and sporadic and had happened couple times yesterday and today. There were a few hours yesterday 12Jan2021 where she felt like herself but then it all started again last night. The patient reported feeling disassociated from her body, this was within about 20 minutes of the flushing and went in and out of being more or less alarming. She stated she felt disconnecting from where she was and space she was in, mentally. She knew where she was but could feel no connection to where she was or her body. The patient would touch her hand but couldn&#39;t feel her hands, it was like they weren&#39;t hers. This was during the half hour of the events occurring. She had mild nausea, this started not long after the flushing and it came and went a little bit but it was not too troublesome. The patient felt disconnect from her body and had shakiness like her lower leg feel shaky and weak and tingly. This happened on and off since the episodes started. The patient reported she slept great and had a few hours yesterday where she felt good. Her arm was tender, this might have been yesterday but she thought it was this morning and was only tender to touch. The hand on that same side was painful, but not unbearable, just uncomfortable. The patient apologized for being emotional and tearful. She felt completely overwhelmed. She couldn&#39;t believe that she put herself in this position and she was perfectly fine before the shot. She did contact her doctor. No AE required a visit to emergency room/ physician office. There had been no treatment, she didn&#39;t know what to do. She remarked she was not going back for the second dose. Outcome of event dizziness was not recovered, and the rest of events was unknown.

A 56-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on unknown date Intramuscularly at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included she did have the Virus itself in December and concomitant medications were reported none. Nurse stated, she just was not sure what you really wanted to know as far as adverse reactions for the Covid 19 Vaccine. She just had kind of the whole gambit. Patient experienced temperature of 102.9, GI symptoms, muscle ache, joint pain, headache. And she did not receive any treatment, other than home Motrin type medication, may be some Maalox type. The only thing to know was she did have the Virus itself in December and she did not know if it was because she had such antibodies still on board that she had such a severe reaction or more extreme that was all. That was her only thing she reported and her symptoms came latently like she had it on the 25th or the 5th she mean, her symptoms really did not start until the following day and lasted for several, 2 and half days. The outcome of the events was unknown. There was a reasonable possibility that the adverse events were related to suspect drug by reporter.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. No prior other vaccinations administered within 4 weeks. The patient took the second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Thursday 07Jan2021 at 15:30. She called employee health and was advised to call Pfizer to report side effects since she is not feeling good. She had never had the covid diagnosis. On Friday (08Jan2021) she worked all day and felt arm soreness and sinus congestion but nothing out of the ordinary. The patient reported her right arm was still tender to touch, if she rotated her arm she can feel that she had the shot and she was still tender in her left arm from the first shot. The first shot hurt way more and hurt all over the whole arm, it was throbbing. On 08Jan2021 evening she felt really lightheaded, she thought maybe it was her sinuses since it is dry due to winter.

On 08Jan2021, she also experienced muscle stiffness and fatigue which had improved after a hot shower, that helped. She felt like she had a bad flu shot. The only time she ever felt similar to this was when she received the H1N1 flut shot in 2015 or 2016. She did not have lot number, NDC, or expiration date to provide. Treatment included: took Tylenol on Saturday. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office (she is trying to get an appointment to see the doctor).

                                                On the evening of Sunday December 27th I became violently ill.  I began vomiting and continued all night long.  I had severe body aches and chills.  I was unable to find my thermometer so am not sure of tempertature.  I had lower back pain so severe I couldn&#39;t lie down.  I tried to take Tylenol but was unable to keep it down.  By morning  I got access to Tylenol suppositories,  Dramamine, and a thermometer.  My temperature before Tylenol was 104.4.  These symptoms continued over the next 3 days though vastly improved with Tylenol, Dramamine and IV fluids.  I received a negative COVID test on Thursday.  I have only been this ill once before in my life.  By Thursday I was not longer febrile, only weak and exhausted.  I have to now determine whether or not to get the second vaccination.   I know  this seems to be a somewhat delayed reaction.  Any advice would be appreciated.

Took 1000 mg of Tylenol; and I was feeling okay. Just arm was sore. Not extremely sore. 8 pm at night - started shaking; knees were knocking together; severe chills; and it took a few minutes to recognize what was happening - took temp. 99.4; took another 1000mg tylenol; went to bathroom and without notice -  puked; woke up an hour after going to bed with worsened chills; 10:30 pm - temp 102.4; too early to take more Tylenol and so took pharmacy&#39;s version of Nyquil. Slept through the night after Nyquil but woke up with chills continuing - temp 103. 8 at 4:30 am; and then sat at side of bed and took tylenol 1000 mg  and got up to go to bathroom and couldn&#39;t walk forward and felt my arm hurt really really bad; couldn&#39;t walk forward; I leaned against the wall and bounced against the next wall and kept walking and grabbed a bedroom doorknob and got into the bathroom and fell on toilet and then crawled to couch because I couldn&#39;t walk straight. Stayed on a couch for two hours and then it was gone. Fever and chills continued that whole day on 24th. Didn&#39;t eat/had no appetite. Christmas day -no fever. Felt shaky though - like I&#39;d been super sick. No appetite still. Felt woozy and shaky inside (felt shaky inside) and that lasted for several days.  Appetite still remains poor. 02 stats were low through all of it - four liters (up two liters than normal.  Contacted: a pulmonologist - Dr. and she helped with O2 questions.

It was through the roof/Blood pressure was high and she was concerned she would have a stroke; Muscle soreness; Arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (physical therapist). A 57-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular on the left arm on 21Dec2020 08:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; and sumatriptan from 25Dec2020 to an unspecified date at unknown dose and frequency (standard unknown dose/ She only gets 9 pills a month) for migraine. Medical history included ongoing migraine, obesity (She would say she was kind of obese), coeliac disease (She had Celiac disease and cannot eat gluten which was diagnosed since she was 4), chronic back pain (this was diagnosed a couple of years before she took the COVID vaccine), spinal stenosis (this was diagnosed a couple of years before she took the COVID vaccine), and pain (she took hydrocodone for pain but did not take any that day).  Concomitant medication included hydrocodone for pain. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and events following prior vaccinations were none. The patient had the vaccine on 21Dec2020, and she got sick on Christmas day. She was vomiting at 14:00 and did not know if it was a side effect or not.  She did have arm soreness muscle soreness at 15:00, that evening and the next day too. She normally gets a migraine once a month. She does not normally throw up with a headache though. The vomiting started when she threw up twice on 25Dec2020, then once on morning of 26Dec2020.  She also had very high blood pressure. It was through the roof.  She did not know if that was related to drug for migraine or vaccine. She also had the headache at 14:00 the whole time. She believed she threw up before she took Sumatriptan. The muscles got rigid and tight in her neck and she doesn&#39;t think she took it. She threw up and then she took it. She did not have a lot or expiration. There was no ER nor physician&#39;s office required. She would have it if her car was not buried in snow. Her blood pressure was high and she was concerned she would have a stroke. It was usually around 110/70 and was always very low usually. She did not know if it was accurate, but it was 165/124 at one point and she did know her pulse was accurate. She did not provide her pulse rate. She did not know if she was throwing up because her blood pressure was high and did not know if blood  pressure was high because of Sumatriptan. She only gets 9 pills a month. She did not know if high blood pressure was one of the side effects. It was not a real safe medication to take once a day. She only took it once a month and only once that day. She had never thrown up with  migraines before and was just concerned. She doesn&#39;t usually take her blood pressure and doesn&#39;t know if the Sumatriptan always makes it go up or not. She doesn&#39;t know if she had the flu bug or not. The action taken in response to the events for bnt162b2 was not applicable, while for sumatriptan was unknown. Clinical outcome of sickness and influenza was unknown, for headache was recovered on 27Dec2020, while for the other events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the elevated BP and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.   This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Next afternoon, Jan 5, I got severe myalgias, fever up to 100, severe fatigue, went home after work and slept til the next morning, went to work, took ibuprofen, and the myalgias improved and felt better. But around 3 pm, Jan 6, I got mild vertigo. By about 7pm Jan 6, I noticed my L ear didn&#39;t hear well. I changed the battery in my hearing aide and cleaned it but It made no difference. I woke up on Jan 7 with severe vertigo and hearing loss. I did Epley&#39;s maneuvers with no effect. I have had similar episodes. I went to work, but gave up when I could not hear patients talking to me. I went to the Emergency Dept and got admitted. I was too unsteady on my feet. Audiogram showed profound hearing loss both ears and almost complete loss of discrmination in R ear. I was put on high dose steroids. Also having tinnitus (mostly whooshing sound of my own pulse). MRI negative. Blood work negative. Some mild improvement now, after 1 dose steroids.

Was so cold, had to get a heating blanket to put over me, along with 2 blankets. Was shaking so bad, could hardly walk. Was slightly disoriented at the time. This lasted for 4 hours. Temperature is normally 95.6, did rise to 98.7. Had severe body aches that lasted until the next day, but were not as severe. the following day was very tired and muscles were achy. I did take tylenol, which seemed to help.

The second vaccine is causing the same thing.  My muscles in my upper arm hurt really bad, the pain goes down to my wrist and my arm is weak. Its been 4 days since the second vaccine and its not stopped at all.

                                                Approximately 4-6 hours post vaccine I experienced site soreness and felt my hands were stiff, felt swollen, especially the right. Within a few more hours my arm became heavy and I had some general muscular achiness. By approximately 11pm I had intense muscular pain on the back of my legs making it difficult to stand. It felt like I had been hit repeatedly with 2x4s. About that time my posterior ribcage hurt also. I couldn&#39;t sleep, turning frequently as my hips hurt. This is what I felt like when I had COVID. Intense pain.  At 0630 (1/14) I got out of bed and felt I was going to faint, was extremely nauseous (I did not vomit) and had a very bad, global headache. I had to lay down again. My temp was 100.1 orally. I could not go to work. I was able to take Tylenol. It helped the pain but two hours later my temp was 100.8. I could not get out of bed  until 6pm, I felt delirious when I tried.  I was able to go to work on 1/15. Of note, following my first dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer BioNtech Lot #EH9899 on 12/23/20) I had site soreness, heaviness of my left arm, T of 99.5 same day (about 10-12 hours post vaccination), and mild body aches for about a day.

Symptoms progressed to a patch of redness,diffuse and bumpy induration, and warmth measuring approximately 8x10 cm. Skin is intact with no pustules or vesicles. Indistinct margins. No symptoms or involvement of the inner aspect of the arm or axilla. No adenopathy. Have used topical Hydrocortisone and oral Benadryl with some relief, but symptoms persist now 6 days post vaccine.  Symptoms are enough to wake me at night due to arm itchiness and  discomfort.

On December 27th at 4:00 PM sudden onset worst bone pain ever unrelieved with Tylenol, malaise and nausea. December 28th at 1:00 AM awoke in pain and &#34;on fire&#34; I have never been so hot, truly felt like my skin was on fire. Tympanic thermometer 99.0F. Awoke feeling fine and went to work thinking this was SE however symptoms recurred later that morning so I went for testing as I could not differentiate between SE vs illness. Covid negative. If this was a delayed response to vaccine, wanted to report: severe bone pain unrelieved w Tylenol , malaise, nausea, 48 hours. thanks, NP

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 01Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as Covid 19 vaccine; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 vaccination. Medical history included having something called Adult Still&#39;s which is bad Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she got the vaccine and was experiencing sever cramps in her legs and thighs, and muscle joints pain. She mentioned on a scale of 1-10 it is 20. The patient also experienced flu like symptoms which were body ache and extremely tired. The patient reported that she called because she received her first Covid shot on 17Dec2020 and she was really sick from then, she was talking like super sick. In Dec2020, she had muscle cramps, headache, no fever but like she had the flu. She has something called Adult Still&#39;s which is bad Rheumatoid Arthritis, so it caused her to go into the flare but she was still sick. She was still feeling bad. She was still having muscle pains in her leg. The patient mentioned that she had to go to the emergency room because she could barely move her leg. They told her that it was a combination of Adult still&#39;s and her Covid 19 shot, so they gave her some medications. They gave her Lyrica 75 mg, twice a day and it messed me up that she couldn&#39;t even function. So, now she had to come home from work and now she was still having the leg cramps and just not feeling well so what can she do to feel myself better. The outcome of the event cramps in legs was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

A 58-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number 5K5730/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID Prevention. The patient had no relevant medical history. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine for immunisation which caused arm pain. The patient had no concomitant medications. She had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient received her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 18Dec2020, and at first, she just had pain in her arm. It started getting sore in the evening of 18Dec2020. She suspected that would happen, because she gets that with the flu shot too. A few days after receiving the vaccine, she had pretty severe neck pain, and at first she just thought that maybe she slept wrong, but she still had neck pain. She was sitting with hand warmer packs on her neck because the pain was at the point bad enough that she could barely turn her neck. She experienced muscle pain that was almost like a horse in the muscles above her hips and in her back. The pain in her hips and back is bad enough that it almost takes her down. The patient also experienced muscle cramping. She further stated that she had not done anything different; she did not got to the gym. She remembered that when she signed off to get the vaccine, there was something about not taking the vaccine if someone had ever had a side effect to a lipid. The outcome of the events was recovered on 20Dec2020 for pain in her arm, recovering for neck pain, not recovered for muscle pain that was almost like a horse in the muscles above her hips and in her back, unknown for muscle cramping.

Went to bed with chills. Woke with pain and  stiffness in right shoulder joint. Nausea subsided and I took 50 mg immitrex. Could no longer lay  down due to head pain, so slept sitting up two hours. Chills continued. Meds finally worked and headache subsided. Chills subsided. Mild nausea persists this evening.

                                                On the day of taking the vaccines had joint pains all over mainly involving the arms but they subsided. On the next day noticed redness and pain in the left eye. On 1/6/21 noticed diminished  vision and blurriness in the left eye. Called opthalmology  ED and was seen the next day on 1/7/2021 morning .  Was diagnosed with left uveitis. I was seen by the on call doctor.  There are many doctors involved in my care. My previous episodes of uveitis have been mostly in the right eye and the vision was not affected,  The doctors involved in my care are not sure if this was just a coincidence, was an exacerbation of the preexisting pathology or was something new.  I have asked to put the eye drops every hourly but the vision has not completely improved. I don&#39;t use the eye drops in the night and when I get up in the morning it is still very hard to read.  It is an unusual episode of uveitis as typically my left eye is not involved and I have never had this much diminished vision , I am supposed to put the drops every one hourly until 1/11/2021. I have informed my PCP, Rheumatologist, regular eye doctor.  I will inform my ID doctor Dr .

                                                Received vaccine on Monday by Wed afternoon lower abdominal cramping and feeling very unwell.  By Wed evening had chills and low grade fever 99.4.  Called out of work Thursday.  Felt terrible.  Thursday morning lower abdominal cramping consistent and pain scale between 4-5 with occasional spikes to 8.  Also felt terrible.  Had body aches, could only lay on couch.   Called my gastroenterologist.  Office returned call late afternoon and stated probably from vaccine and if it worsens or fever to call primary and to fill out VAERS form.  Thursday evening had temp of 100.4 and started with a cough where it felt I couldn&#39;t take deep breaths.  Only lasted a few hours.  Abdominal pain persisted.  Friday morning woke up and now have headache, but abdominal pain is now down to a 2 and I feel achy, but feeling a bit better.  Had to call out of work still too sick to go in.  No cough.  No fever.  Since I was feeling better my hope was since it was vaccine related that I would wake on Saturday and be totally fine, unfortunately, not the case.  Saturday morning abdominal pain same at a 2 and headache was on and off through the day into the night.  Still pretty much rested all day into the night.  Sunday morning much better.  Headache gone and abdominal pain down to a 1 and sometimes just vague.   Although I&#39;m feeling better my head feels out of sorts, kind of like my brain can&#39;t keep up with my eyes?  And new symptoms? right ear crackling and teeth on right side feel sensitive also,  pain under left armpit.  It&#39;s tender and lasts through the day.  Monday still feeling a bit lightheaded and fatigued and armpit pain still there but not worse and feel able to go to work to see if I can.  Tooth sensitivity also still there but ear pain gone.  Called primary doctor she suggests getting Covid test and have appointment for phone conference for Tuesday with doctor, also had  Covid test today at work  (was Covid tested last Monday also for work and negative) into Monday night head is still feeling &#34;off&#34;.  Tuesday armpit pain still same and dizzy head feeling same, mild abdominal pain comes and goes - Not bad enough to stop daily activity.  Spoke with primary doctor and she said side effects could possibly last this long and let her know when yesterday&#39;s Covid test comes in.........

                                                Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   I received the first Pfizer Vaccine (EH9899) on 12/19/20. A few days later, I felt like my head, on the side of my right ear, had a great deal of pressure in it and it felt &#34;funny &#34; but it did not really hurt. It was uncomfortable and distracting. I waited to see if it would go away. I noticed my hearing was decreased . On 01/06/20 when I woke up, my hearing was completely gone in my right ear. I could hear nothing out of that ear.  I had a noise in my head. Just a loud roaring noise. I had severe vertigo and could not walk across the room. I describe this as I felt like I was on a merry-go-round and someone was spinning me really fast. (continue)  Additional information for Item 18: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   continued:    I also experienced severe vomiting and could not stop. My husband took me to the doctor. Since I could not get in to my regular doctor that day, we went to an ear doctor I had visited a couple of years ago because that was the only person I could find to see me on short notice. I had regular hearing test in the past and my hearing was normal last time he checked it.  After doing a hearing test, he verified my Hearing was severely decreased in my right ear. I explained to him, I also feel &#34;foggy&#34; and I have problems concentrating, was having vertigo, and vomiting. I am not sure if that is because of the constant sound in my ear that distracts me but it is a definite problem and interferes with my work. I cannot concentrate. He started me on Steroids (Prednisone) 60 mg a day for 7 days, then 40 mg for 3 days, then 20 mg for three days, Antivert 12.5 mg three times a day as needed, and Zofran for the vomiting if I needed that.  I have not experienced anymore vomiting and the Vertigo has been very limited. Mostly when I lay down now instead of when I stand up.  My blood pressure has also been slightly elevated, but it could be from the Steroids.   I was scheduled to take the 2nd Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21. Since I was receiving the high doses of Steroids, I was concerned that the vaccine would not be effective or may interact with the steroids so I went to my family doctor 01/08/21, for a visit. He said he would check and let me know if it was contraindicated for me to take the Vaccine on high doses of steroids. When I did not hear from him, because I had to take the vaccine the next day, I called the Pharmacy and talked to someone there and they told me the agency was still recommending you take the Vaccine even if you are on the steroids. I received the second Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21.  My hearing is now coming and going but I can hardly hear anything out of that right ear. . There is a constant noise, like a roaring, in my head and I still have problems concentrating. I have had no more vomiting and my vertigo has hot been as severe but I have experienced some at times.   I reported to the Pharmacy the day I received my vaccine, 01/09/21, about the things I had experienced this since my first vaccine. They took my information and said they would call me but today is 01/12/21 and I have not heard from them yet so I thought I would go ahead and report this. I am concerned this was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I return to the doctor 01/20/21 for a repeat hearing exam.   The Doctor expressed this condition could be a permanent and disabling  issue but currently being treated and will follow up with more testing.   I am also concerned about how the second vaccine affected me because I was receiving the high doses of Steroids at the time I received it.    I am sending this from a work email so if you reply, please reply to personal email.

She said if she continues feeling the way she is, she will see her doctor. She said her system seems off.

A 58-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EK9231), intramuscular in right arm, on 07Jan2021 at 10:00, at a single dose, COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included hypertension (HTN), exercise induced asthma, allergies to sulfa, and hormones. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included lisinopril, carvedilol (COREG), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), and unspecified hormones. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 on 16Dec2020 (also reported as 20Dec2020) at 2:00 PM for COVID-19 immunization (intramuscular in left arm; Lot Number: EK5730). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in a hospital. On 07Jan2021 at 10 PM (also reported as 7 hours after shot), the patient&#39;s right arm became painful and could not touch or move without lots of pain. 1 hour later, the patient went to bed, only to be woken with excruciating muscle pain all over. The patient was unable to lie down, sit, stand, or move without severe pain. The patient took ibuprofen (MOTRIN) and applied heat and lied down on stomach. Within 4 hours, that pain decreased, and the next 24 hours was very achy all over. The patient used heat most of the day. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was recovering from the events.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

This 58-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot  EJ1685 or FJ1685), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 09Jan2021 06:00 for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation on unknown date (1 episode), allergic to Keflex. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot  EJ1685 or FJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 22Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunisation.  On 10Jan2021 01:00 AM, the patient experienced: I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in i was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive (loss of consciousness) (medically significant), I had my 2nd vaccine at work early sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day (feeling abnormal), Iwoke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise (malaise), I was covered in sweat (hyperhidrosis), vomited (vomiting), I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F (pyrexia), sore (pain), I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response (seizure). No treatment required. The outcome of the events was recovered.   The events were described as follows: I am healthy RN with no active medical problems. I had my 2nd vaccine at work early Sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day, I expected this so was not alarmed and went to bed around 10pm. I woke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise and went to the bathroom in case I might vomit, etc. and I tried to have a BM. I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in I was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive. He yelled at me for about 10 seconds and I came to, I was covered in sweat. I asked him to walk me back to the bedroom where I again passed out, fell to the floor and hit the bed, then was unresponsive again for about 10 seconds then came to again and vomited. After this I felt completely relieved of my malaise. I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F. After this I was sore but otherwise completely okay, the next day I had a temp of 99.5°F. Today I am back to normal. I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response. The vaccine was administered at Hospital Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event &#34;began to pass out&#34; with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

                                                Large uncomfortable lymphadenopathy in L neck/clavicle area, the size of a lemon.  It hurt to move my neck, and is very tender to touch.  It is still present now, 10 days after receiving the vaccination.  I saw my MD today who assured me it is a typical appearance for a lymphadenopathy, but it still bothers me, especially never having had such an occurrence before.

I began taking Tylenol which caused the pain to subside to a reasonable level.  I took Tylenol every 6 hours to keep the pain in my arm, which seemed to cause some neck stiffness, down to a 2 or 3 level (10 being the worst pain). The next morning pain was down to 1 or 2 level, I took Tylenol again.  By noon the second day pain was gone.

                                                After being observed for approximately 20 minutes and patient walked to her car without assistance I was called to assess the patient in the parking lot for troubles breathing.  EMS was called as I made my way outside.  Upon my arrival patient was leaning out of the car and stating that she could not breath.  She was able to tell me that she was allergic to penicillin.  Oxygen was immediately placed on the patient with minimal relief.  Lung sounds were coarse throughout.  She then  began to vomit about every 20-30 seconds.  Epipen was administered in the right leg with no relief.  Patient continued to complain of troubles breathing and vomiting.  A second epipen was administered in the patients right arm again with no relief.  A few minutes later patient was given racemic epinephrine through the oxygen mask.  There appeared to be mild improvement in her breathing as she appeared more comfortable, but still complaining of shortness of breath and vomiting.  When EMS arrived patient was unable to transport herself to the stretcher.  When EMS and clinical staff transferred patient to the stretcher she became unresponsive.  She appeared to still be breathing.  She did not respond to verbal stimuli.  Per ED report large amount of fluid was suctioned from the patients lungs following intubation in the ambulance.  When patient arrived to the ED she was extubated and re-intubated without difficulty and further fluid was suctioned.  At that time patient was found to be in PEA, shock was delivered.  Shortly thereafter no cardiac activity was found and patient pronounced dead.

                                                The first symptoms was pain in the injection site. Then felt pain traveling down to my left arm and fingers. I was told I was only to stay 15 minutes after the shot. On my way home from the vaccination about 30 minutes after the shot, I felt sick. I had a rapid heart rate and itch red hives on my left chest and left palm of my hand. My husband stopped along the road and gave me benadryl. I still had hives the next day. On the third day I had vaginal spotting and I am in menopause and  I had extremely bad pain in my left hip, left thigh and left buttocks for 2 weeks. I could not sit or stand up to get relief. I cried with pain and thought I would never recover. I visited a urgent care and he suggested I see a neurologist for the pain. I was tested for covid at that time and was negative. I went to an allergist to see if I am allergic to the PEG in the vaccine. I am not allergic to the compound. She believes my body had a very strong immune response to the vaccine which caused all the symptoms described above. All symptoms were strictly limited to just the left side of my body. I do not know what to do about taking the second dose because I am afraid it will be worse.

I went to bed and when I got up and had a fever, horrible joint and leg pain, horrible leg pain, terrible bouts of nausea until I couldn&#39;t puke anymore. I went into the ER and got fluids and they ran tests and everything was normal. ER said it could be a moderate reaction to the vaccine.

                                                Nausea; Migraine headache; Chills; Joint pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse. A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 10:30 at Left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine was administered at hospital and not administered at military site. Medical history included ongoing spondylolisthesis diagnosed 15-20 years ago and overweight. Her vertebrae were not in physical alignment. The patient was given steroids, but it didn&#39;t help. Steroids didn&#39;t do anything. There was no name or NDC/Lot/Exp of steroids. The patient no longer has steroids. Her back will hurt when she gains weight. Height was now under 5 feet 5 inches (164 cm). The patient had no family medical history. There were no concomitant medications. No additional vaccines administered on same date of pfizer suspect and no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No adverse events follow prior vaccinations. The patient experienced multiple side effects 10 hours after the vaccine and lasted 20 hours. Side effects started 20:00 - 21:00 on 30Dec2020. Side effects were classified as: Nausea, migraine headache, chills, and joint pain. The events was waxing and waning. On 31Dec2020, side effects were 75% gone by 16:00. Joint pain was completely going by 22:00-23:00 on 31Dec2020. Chills were gone between 08:00-09:00 on 31Dec2020. Nausea and migraine headache stayed until 16:00-17:00 on 31Dec2020 and then it went away. At the time of vaccination, there was a low-pressure center coming through. There was also an ice and snowstorm. She was wondering if the headaches and joint pain were due to the weather. The patient took no medication or treatment for spondylolisthesis and wondered if that had something to do with it. The patient really want to have second shot in two weeks. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of the events was recovered on 31Dec2020. Causality assessment by primary reporter via global introspection was unknown.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0615 am on 1/8/21.  Had no symptoms (not even injection site pain). At 2100 on 1/8, began to develop a lot of pain at the injection site.  Within 2 hrs of that time, I developed other symptoms, which include total body (bone and joint) pain (especially in my knees), and what I would describe as a &#34;bad sunburn type&#34; rash across my cheek bones, bridge of my nose, and orbital area.  Small raised bumps to this area, with swelling, and a feeling of pins and needles stabbing me all across my face.  My airway was fine, and at no time did I feel shortness of breath.  I was unable to sleep due to the bone and joint pain, and felt the need to walk continually (it was more painful to stay in one position). These symptoms persisted throughout the day (Saturday 1/9/21), noting at 5pm I described myself &#34;miserable&#34; to my friends and family.  All symptoms described above,  were at their most elevated intensity between the hours of 1700 - 0400. At 0400 Sunday (1/10/21) I felt a gradual release of the body aches, enough so that I could sleep until 0800.  At this time, 1300 (Sunday 1/10)  I note that I still feel &#34;flu type&#34; body aches, but constant pain has diminished in intensity by estimated 50%.  The sunburn type redness and swelling across my face/orbital area has also less by 50% (there is still redness, mild swelling, warmth, and some raised bumps across this area;  pins and needles feeling is gone).

                                                Six hours after being administered by the vaccine I started to feel soreness around the site. Within the hour it progressed to pain in my left upper arm radiating down to my lower arm. By this time, I had difficulty raising my arm and limited ROM. This continued for three days. The symptoms eased up a little bit but there was constant pain whenever I raised my affected arm. When I went to work on the night of the Jan third, I felt my arm hurting during the night. I took ADVIL for the pain and continued to do so. Jan 6 and 7 At night, I was awoken with excruciating pain on the same arm. This lasted for approximately a couple of mins. I sought a virtual consultation with my PCP who advised me to take ten days off from work. I am currently on medical leave. I haven&#39;t experienced the same excruciating pain as I had those two nights. However, my ROM is still limited because there is still moderate pain involved. I&#39;ve stopped taking Advil since it has started to upset my stomach.

A 59-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Dec2020 14:15 at first single dose (0.3 cc, but really uncertain of dose) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID virus from Nov2020 to 2020 (The patient was not hospitalized. It was a mild case and lasted about 10 days. she had any positive antibodies at that time. Was off work for about 12 days and was very lucky to have had a very light case with fever, cough, cold, and super fatigue). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines at the same time or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccinations in past or events.  Caller reported she had the first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on the 30Dec2020 and having some side effect symptoms and her supervisor recommended for her to report these things, they are not life threatening, obviously, but things were still lingering. Side effect of severe fatigue started on the 31Dec2020 and lasted for 72 hours. It was so severe, now it is mild. The patient reported soreness around the injection site. Had a fever on the night of the 31Dec2020 of 101.3 and had that for 6 hours then it dissipated and was gone. Had never had a fever after injections before. Had severe arm pain that usually goes along with an injection. It started also that night of 31Dec2020. She had rolled over in the middle of the night and it hurt. That lasted for about 48 hours, but it has improved. Had some muscle aches since 31Dec2020 but that had improved and had joint pains since 31Dec2020. What was worrisome was the swollen lymph nodes under her right arm, the armpit area had swollen and painful lymph nodes, since 31Dec2020. The patient was still having that and that is why she was so concerned because shouldn&#39;t that have gone away after a week. Had knee and hip joint pain, but that had improved. Again, mentioned she had never had that before with an injection. The patient received vaccine at her workplace. Some of her coworkers got it the same day and no one else has this. Mentioned she did have COVID virus back in Nov2020 and wonders if this correlates with her getting the vaccine. Was not hospitalized or notified she had any positive antibodies at that time. Was off work for about 12 days and was very lucky to have had a very light case with fever, cough, cold, and super fatigue. This is the same way she felt back when she had the virus back in November. The patient was concerned about having these side effects would it be okay for her to get the next injection in 3 weeks. AEs did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. No further details provided. Outcome of the events Fever was recovered, of event swollen and painful lymph nodes was not recovered, of events knees and hip joint pain, fatigue, muscle pain, severe arm pain was recovering, of event soreness around the injection site was unknown.  The reporter considered the events severe fatigue, fever, swollen lymph nodes and pain under right arm, knees and hip joint pain as serious (medically significant). The reporter considered the events severe fatigue, fever, severe arm pain, muscle ache, swollen lymph nodes and pain under right arm, knees and hip joint pain as related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I received 2nd injection of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine at 1015AM on 1-12-21 and was doing great. I had taken one 325mg Tylenol and one  200mg Ibuprofen approximately 60 minutes prior to receiving vaccine (which is what I did prior to the first vaccine). I was doing great initially following the vaccine. I took another 325mg Tylenol and 200mg Ibuprofen when I went to bed at 2000  1-12-21. At 0300 1-13-21 I woke up feeling nauseated and when attempting to turn over to my right side I moaned loudly because I could not hardly move my left arm. My husband was woken and turned on the bedroom light and we noted a 3 inch bruise and large knot on my left deltoid at the injection site. He told me that I felt warm. I took my temperature that was 101.2 degrees. I took 650mg Tylenol and that time. At 0500 1-13-21 I was having chills, muscle and joint aches. I could not fully close my hands into a grip. My &#34;brain&#34; hurt, not a headache but literally it hurt to move my head. I would occasionally get a sharp pain in the front and back of my head. My temperature went to its highest at approximately 1500 1-13-21 to 102.5 degrees. I continued to offset Tylenol with Ibuprofen throughout the day. At 2000 1-13-21 my temperature was 101.8 and began to trend downward.  I went to bed and when I woke up on 1-14-21 I felt 100% better with just a little fatigue from the inability to sleep the day prior.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got her first shot on 19Dec2020 and had some muscle spasms on Dec2020, but it was gone after two (2) days. On Saturday (09Jan2021), she got her second shot and she was in a giant muscle spasm from head to toe. It was like a whole-body Charlie horse that won&#39;t quit, and it hurts. It started three (3) hours after the shot and is not going away. It hurts and worked her up. The patient called to ask what she can request to treat the muscle spasm; a muscle relaxer? Patient didn&#39;t want to take anything that will counteract the vaccine. The event was reported as Non-serious. The patient recovered from muscle spasms on an unspecified date in Dec2020.  information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I reached a fever of 103.6 and had pain and extreme redness in my right tissue expander. I also had all axillary lymph nodes removed from that side in December 2020. On Friday I was still feeling ill and noticed redness, so I immediately contacted my doctor and was instructed to meet him at the hospital. I was admitted and placed on antibiotics and had my tissue expander removed The next morning after no improvement from antibiotic infusion. I had a wound vac placed and stayed in the hospital for one week and had my expander replaced on that following Saturday.  I am not planning on taking the second shot.

A 59-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 59) as a single dose, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included an unspecified heart condition and a flu shot un an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) and ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS [ASCORBIC ACID;ERGOCALCIFEROL;NICOTINAMIDE;RETINOL;RIBOFLAVIN;THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE). The patient stated, &#34;I am calling about the side effects I had from my Covid shot vaccine. I am concerned about getting the second one because my reaction was so big. I got it on Saturday, this past Saturday about 12:45 I think 12:30 and I did fine, the shot didn&#39;t hurt at all. That night I was a little bit tired but that&#39;s it. My arm was just little bit sore. The next day I got up, I still felt good I went to work for 2 hours and then about 12 o&#39;clock it hit me all at once. This Sunday I ran anywhere from a 103 to 104.6 fever and that was me taking Tylenol and I took Tylenol every 4 hour because my fever was still high. The glands in my neck and the glands under my arm on the side where I got the shot swelled up, they are still swollen. My whole body ached. I had Covid fairly bad I got pneumonia with it all for &#34;two weeks&#34; (not clarified) but my fever was not as high as got with the shot, the vaccine like I could barely walk after the vaccine because my joints were so stiff only way I could walk was to shuffle my feet, it was horrible. I had a fever yesterday all day but it was only in the 102.3 and 4, it never went back to 103. Glands in my arm and my neck hurt quite badly. My arm where I got it, it wasn&#39;t swollen but I get the same reaction when I get a Flu shot (unspecified shot) so that&#39;s not a big deal. I got horrible headaches. I had diarrhea all day Sunday and yesterday and so this morning my fever is only right around 101 like 101.1, 101.2, I am still super tired and also yesterday and day before I was dizzy and foggy. I still have a slight fever today. My lymph nodes are still swollen, my neck and under my arm, my arm where I got the shot is still swollen and sore but I can tolerate that. My joints are stiff a little bit but not nearly as bad as they were, so I don&#39;t know if I should get the second shot, everyone says the second shot is worst like all those heart palpitations start with it as well.&#34; One of my other symptom is at night I break out into a horrible sweat like I have to change my pajamas twice. It was last night and the night before. I am like really wet.&#34;  The outcome of the events was not reported.
