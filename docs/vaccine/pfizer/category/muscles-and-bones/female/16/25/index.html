                                                Pain between the breasts on the ribs. Started out as seconds of slight pain the day after shot until about 9:30pm when the pain became consistent but was a slight pain. I woke up at 2:30am and my chest hurt really badly. It was a constant pain but the amount of pain was back and forth. It hurt more to lay down and if I bent down it was very painful. I stayed up for an hour and a half until the pain went away. When it did I had sweat a lot and was very hot.  I then woke up with little discomfort until an hour after I woke up with slight pain. The pain then has gone off and on but not as painful as it was during the night.

A few minutes later she struggled to make a fist with her same hand and reported having pain going up her neck. The injection site did swell up a few minutes after the injection as well and she felt tingling in her hands shortly after. Patient was given 25 mg of benadryl after she reported the tingling in her hands. She did not have any difficulty breathing though. She was able to stand up and walk with her parent to the car and was driven to ER by parent to be checked out.

Within several days of receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose #2, patient began experiencing worsening/flare of ulcerative colitis symptoms including stomach pain, diarrhea, fatigue, arthritis pain that lasted beyond the reasonable and known duration of vaccine related side-effects. Symptoms treated with dicyclomine and acetaminophen with no relief.  Symptoms continued x 2 weeks.  Patient ultimately required addition of budesonide to treatment regimen for ulcerative colitis and is currently having relief of symptoms.

                                                The patient felt tired and describes her eyes going dark, then passed out a few minutes after vaccination.  She was vaccinated and then left the immunization room to sit down for a 15 minute waiting period.  When she went to sit down, she collapsed on the floor.  Her mother assisted her into a chair.  She continued to be incoherent and have her eyes rolling back into her head for a few minutes.  We used a cool cloth on her forehead and the back of her neck.  The parents requested that we call 911.  EMS arrived shortly and evaluated her.  Heart rate, blood pressure, pulse ox, blood sugar and chest sounds were all within normal range.  The patient stated that her arm felt heavy and &#34;funny&#34;.  She then stated that her tongue felt funny.  EMS evaluated her tongue and said it looked normal.  To err on the side of caution, she was taken to the hospital to determine whether or not she was having a delayed onset anaphylactic reaction.  This patient has no history of seizures.

                                                12 hours post vaccine she had severe myalgia, rash on both arms and legs, headache, nausea, stomach pain, and mild swelling in legs. Over the next 48 hours the rash darkened and spread to the entire body causing pain in her skin. The myalgia became nearly unbearable and both Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen didn&#39;t put a dent in the pain. One side of her face swelled so that one eye could only partially open. The nausea and stomach pain worsened so that she couldn&#39;t eat. Headache became intense. By 48 hours post vaccine she became delirious - her speech was slurred and difficult to comprehend. She would fall asleep for a few minutes and wake up unaware of where she was or what was happening. She never got a fever but did have chills. Around this time I called a relative who is a doctor to seek advice and Diphenhydramine was recommended. Benedryl helped immensely. 30 minutes after taking it she could speak clearly, was more alert, pain became tolerable, and her appetite returned. Symptoms and swelling returned when the Benedryl wore off so she continued taking it every 4 hours for the next two days until it wasn&#39;t necessary any more. The myalgia, stomach pain and headache persisted for 7 days. At 8 days post vaccine (today) a mild headache, mild and intermittent stomach pain, and mild fatigue are her only remaining symptoms. Her pediatrician cannot see her until next week but we have an appt for the 22nd.

                                                The rash first started on her hands on 4/2 and was originally attributed to powdered gloves she used during her job at a restaurant. She had her wisdom teeth out on 3/24 and started amoxicillin and steroids for the wisdom teeth on 3/25. She had her first COVID vaccine on 3/30 with arm pain only on 3/31.  She was seen in the urgent care on 4/4 . Rash felt to be due to amoxicillin or contact dermatitis (gloves). She stopped amoxicillin. The rash has continued to evolve. Originally maculopapular and only on hands, nby 4/13  there was both a maculopapular rash in addition to urticarial lesions primarily on her lower extremities, but also present on her trunk and in her groin. It is intensely pruritic. It seems to change over time, though the family is not entirely sure about that. Certainly, they describe confluent erythema and swelling over her right ankle the morning  of 4/13 which was not present by the time she saw me that afternoon. She has had ankle arthralgias as well.    as of 4/16, rash is gone other than feet.

                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

We were to start ibuprofen and ice, avoid any touching of the area, and monitor it for a few days. That was Monday, and it is now Friday. The lump is still there but it is slightly less painful. If it isn&#39;t better by Monday, we will see the pediatrician.

A 17-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8731) via an unspecified route of administration on 07Apr2021 at 15:15 (at the age of 17-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event was reported as none. Concomitant mediations included ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (JOLESSA) taken &#34;to decrease her periods&#34; from 2019 (&#34;about two years ago&#34;) and ongoing and at an unspecified dose, cyclic, for three months straight with no placebo. Then takes a placebo pill for one week straight and biotin taken &#34;for hair and nail growth&#34; from an unspecified date (&#34;she began taking within the last 6 months&#34;) and ongoing. There was no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine, there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. It was not provided whether there were adverse events following prior vaccinations. On 07Apr2021 the patient experienced began having left eye twitches and they progressed to spasms and the nose and left side of her face. It then included both sides of her face, patient could not open her eye or control her face, her left leg had goosebumps and chills, pinching in her left shoulder, nausea and headache. The reporter called to report that her daughter had a severe reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in her left arm. Less than an hour after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed goosebumps and chills in her left leg. The reporter was not very concerned about it at the time. About 9:00PM that same night, the patient started complaining of pinching in her left shoulder. The reporter was not too terribly concerned. By 9:30PM, that same night, the patient started to have left eye twitches. Then they increased to eye spasms, then the patient could not open her eye or control her face. Then, it progressed to patients nose and left side of her face. At that point, the reporter tried to contact a nurse with the health insurance advice line. She waited for 30 minutes. The patient&#39;s symptoms continued to get worse, so the reporter took the patient to the emergency room. While the patient was in the emergency room triage, while hospital staff were getting her blood pressure and temperature, her symptoms also started to involve the right side of her face. Around 10:15PM, that same night, the patient started to get nauseous and a headache kicked in. The emergency department took patient straight back to a room. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The emergency department started an IV on the patient, and they administered Reglan, Benadryl, and Toradol to treat her symptoms. The emergency department ran blood tests, preformed a urinalysis and a CT scan. The reporter did not know what all blood testing that was done revealed; however, the reporter did know that they told her that none of the testing revealed anything and were all normal. The patient was eventually discharged from the emergency department at about 1:50AM. She was sent home with Butalbital, for headache and was advised to take ibuprofen. She was still having the twitching but not as bad when discharged. On 08Apr2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had not completely subsided, but were significantly better. On 08Apr2021, the patient woke up with nausea, chills and a headache. The reporter expected the patient to have these side effects. The side effects continued until very late in the day on 10Apr2021. The patient never vomited, was only very nauseous. The reporter also stated that when the woman was administering the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the woman said &#34;oops&#34; and it was not explained what &#34;oops&#34; meant. The reporter asked if it was possible that the patient received the dose subcutaneously and that was why she had these side effects. The reporter also stated that the second dose was scheduled for 28Apr2021 and she asked if the patient should receive the second dose. The clinical outcomes of the events began having left eye twitches and they progressed to spasms and the nose and left side of her face. It then included both sides of her face, patient could not open her eye or control her face, her left leg had goosebumps and chills, pinching in her left shoulder, nausea and headache all recovered/resolved on 10Apr2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed; No further information is expected.

She then said she had tingling in her fingers, which progressed to difficulty moving her fingers/stiff fingers, and coldness and redness in tips of fingers. She then reported she was loosing sensations in her feet and legs. 911 was called. We tried to have the patient take slow deep breaths. We offered an ice pack and water up front and a heat pack for her fingers. Paramedics arrived. Her blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, glucose were within normal limits. She was given oxygen and the paramedic was able to help her slow her breathing. Her fingers went back to normal and she felt fine before leaving. She did not feel the need to go with the paramedics.

The next day  I could be rly wake up, my arm was incredibly sore and I felt sick to my stomach in waves. (rolling nausea)  During the day I had off and on headaches that became a full on migraine my dinner. My arm stayed sore and hard to use all day and at night about 7:30 - 8:00 a sharp pain started lancing through my thigh to my knee, after a half hour or so it moved to include down to my ankle, then spaced out between the three randomly till about nine wen it moved to my side for about twenty minutes or so before becoming a dull throb in my leg till I fell asleep.  The next day I felt a slight ickyness that last off and on all day as well as a light headache that got worse in the evening.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving vaccine client became quiet, clenching fists, and started crying. RN asked if she was okay, stated she was scared and that her arms felt weird and her chest was tight.  RN asked some questions about her health history, she then offered a granola bar and water. Client drank some water, declined snack. Clients hand began to shake, RN offered to lay client on a cot but client declined. Her dad came to check on her, she broke down saying that her arms were numb and chest was tight. The 15 vaccine minute timer went off, client stood but legs were week. She sat down and then slid herself onto the floor. She at first went into a fetal position then laid out flat on the floor. Client began acting more panicked and frantic with short quick breaths and her hands appeared to be contracting some. Clinic team made the decision to call 911 and administer 0.50 mg epinephrine. Ambulance arrived quickly and client was taken to the Medical Center via ambulance.

Medical history included known allergies to Red dye, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), heart murmur, Wilkies syndrome. The patient was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not take other medications in two weeks. The patient previously took Excedrin and experienced allergies. The patient previously received first dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Feb2021 09:45 AM (Lot Number: EL9269) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. On 24Feb2021 at around 7:00pm she started getting a migraine at the base of her head. She then was lethargic, and became extremely nauseous. She started getting extremely cold and then hot within a matter of minutes (inability to control temperature regulation). Her heart rate rose to around 133 just laying down. Her ribs and lungs hurt. And her stomach began to have a really intense stabbing pains. At one point it felt as if she could feel every cell in her body if that makes sense. Not the worst pain she had experienced but definitely not pleasant. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being run over by a car and 1 being a paper cut) she would say it was a 5-6. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Facility type vaccine was facility. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and did not have COVID test post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.

                                                The day after the vaccine was received, the patient noticed arm and face swelling. She also experienced shooting pains and tingling in the same arm she received the vaccination. At work, it hurts when she carries things and has dropped items, which is unusual. Pain is mainly in the shoulder, but sometimes in the forearm. She has tried Tylenol, ice and naproxen with no relief. She received methylprednisolone on 4/12, and now feels that she is having an allergic reaction.  Complaints of increased wheezing, shortness of breath and swelling of her skin, she has used her albuterol inhaler at home which has provided no relief.   On 4/13 she received albuterol by nebulizer and an IV dose of methylprednisolone at the emergency department. She is going to start albuterol nebulizer at home, continue OTC antihistamine, discontinue the methyprednisolone and start prednisone tomorrow.

                                                symptom started 4/21, with pain and tightness in the left arm, progressively spreading up the arm over the following 48 hours, and then to the distal right arm, and legs.  The leg symptom were present when seen 5 days ago, though were not discussed as Patient wasnt sure if thats what was really starting.  This is associated with a feeling of &#34;not being able to feel muc&#34; and &#34;doesn&#39;t feel right&#34;, as if it &#34;feels foreign... body says this is weird,&#34; and feels heavy.  Also notes that different extremities feel different - left is worse than right. Seen 5 days ago, and noted to have been advised by hematology to stop eliquis approximately 2 weeks prior to onset of symptom after PE/Renal artery embolism 1/2021.  At that visit was referred to ER, where workup for repeat clot was normal (CTA, b/l upper extremities dopplers, head/neck CT, CXR).

A 18-years-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9264), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 06Feb2021 12:45 (at the time of 18-years-old) as second dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included partial aortic bicuspid valve, aortic dialation, sulfa wellbutrin allergies (known allergies) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. No other vaccine administered in four weeks. The patient had not covid prior vaccination. The patient had not tested positive for covid post vaccination. Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol/ferrous fumarate/norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE) for an unspecified indication, from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously took bnt162b2 (Pfizer, Lot no EL8982,Administration time=12:15 PM,Vaccine location Left arm, Dose no 1) on 16Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. She received the vaccine at 12:50 PM and my temperature was 98.6 with no symptoms. At 1 am, her temperature went up to 99.6° and a headache, muscle aches and slight chills started. At 4:20 AM, woke up with a 101.6 fever, extreme nausea, dehydration and shakiness. In the morning at 9:00 AM temperature was 100.3 and when I got up around 12:00 PM, was extremely fatigued, dizzy when standing, and slightly nauseous which made it hard to eat normal foods. At 1:20 PM, temperature was 100.7. At 7:00 PM, nausea subsided slightly and was able to eat normal foods. At 10:00 PM, cold chills began in and at 11:00 PM, temperature was 100.4. The next day (08Feb2021), my temperature was at 97.8 upon awakening and felt dizzy, tired and winded with regular activities throughout the days but no fever. By the next day (09Feb), patient was completely syptom free. Arm pain was very minimal, pain level 1, on the day of vaccination and the day after and gone after that. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101.6 (at 4:20 patient temperature was 101.6), 100.3 (at 9 temperature of patient was 100.3), 100.7 (at 13:20 patient temperature was 100.7), 100.4 (at 23:00 patient temperature was 100.4), 99.6 (at 13:00 patient temperature was 99.6F) on 07Feb2021, and 97.8 (patient temperature was 97.8) on 08Feb2021. The patient not received treatment for events. The outcome of events recovered on Feb2021.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

That lasted the entire night.  24 hours after the injection and I am still feeling tightness in my chest when I breathe, sore throat, and sore muscles.

                                                Awoke the next morning with severe headache, fatigue, muscle pain (?felt Like being hit by a truck?). Slept 1.5 days, out of breath walking to bathroom from bed. Treated with sleep and sips of water, soup.  However, her mild daily migraine became more severe 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, her vision has worsened, and her eyes spontaneously dilated with pounding headache a few days ago along with nausea. It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

Thursday night, My heart started racing very quickly and it lasted for 30 minutes - my whole chest was hurting really bad and my heart was beating hard. I had a monitor  - 207 beats per minutes. Blood pressure was normal. ER - monitored my heart. I think they gave me some medication. They gave me a heart monitor to check my heart for next 14 days. There was not another occurrence.

Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

I took one Tylenol to help with the chills and pain about 5 hours after symptoms started and it seemed to help a little.

A 20-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown ), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 at 10:30 AM (at the age of 20-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included allergy to eggs. Historical vaccination included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown ), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 10:30 AM (at the age of 20-years-old) in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The vaccine was administered in a hospital. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The reporter explained that the patient&#39;s adverse events &#34;started as expected&#34; with a  headache side effect (date not specified), however two days after the vaccine, while working as an EMT the patient became very dizzy and had to stop work. She remained dizzy, like vertigo, the next day but attempted to go to work. Her co-worker could see she wasn&#39;t right and took her to the hospital. The patient spent two days in the hospital, barely able to stand, getting a head MRI with contrast, evaluated for vertigo, blood tests, and they did not find anything and gave her vertigo medicine and sent her home. She has since had shifting symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, irregular heartbeat, severe upper back and neck pain. She has barely been able to move for several weeks and has seen an ENT doctor, another emergency doctor, and her regular doctor. None have found any other cause and have tried treating her with steroids. The events were treated with Meklazine and unspecified steroids. Lab data included SARS-CoV-2 test COVID 19 testing on 28Jan2021 which was negative. The clinical outcomes of headache, dizziness, vertigo, difficulty standing, swollen glands, irregular heart rate, back pain, neck pain and unable to more for several weeks were reported as not recovered.  The patient was tested for COIVD-19 after the vaccination, on 28Jan2021, and was found to be negative.

No &#39;trauma&#39; to the site. Nonblanching, two petechiae present within the ring finger&#39;s blister, two also present in the one on my pinky. Those petechiae have disappeared in the last two days, but the spots are still present. Red, not warm, sensitive to touch. I had no other symptoms from dose one of the vaccination, outside of a sore arm and some joint pain. Possibly fatigue, but that&#39;s likely just me being fatigued as per usual.

                                                After receiving the second dosage of my COVID vaccine at 2 PM on 02/03/21, I only had left arm pain near the site of the injection. However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 8:30 AM, I went to use the restroom and felt dizzy with hot flashes. Immediately afterwards, I noticed that I had fainted and my mother helped me to my bed. After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                The morning after my second dose of Pfizer?s Covid-19 vaccine, I woke up feeling freezing (at 9:00 am) and suspected I had a fever.  After waking up again later (around 12:30 pm), I took my temperature and found that I have a fever of 101°F.  I still have a fever and chills (2:50 pm).  I have not taken any medication to treat the fever yet and plan to just take it easy.  If I begin to feel worse, I might take an ibuprofen.  After getting the vaccine, my left shoulder was sore, and is still sore, but it?s my understanding that this is normal, and just as my arm was sore with the first vaccine, it may be 2 days before my arm feels better.  I am not concerned about the soreness of my arm.

                                                I got the shot around 5:20. About 4 hours later I started to feel nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. About an hour after that I had diarrhea. I went to bed, couldn?t fall asleep until 3. I woke up at 6 am sweating a lot and having body aches that were very persistent and painful in my legs. This persisted to 3/12/2021 until about 6 or 7 pm and I began to feel a lot better. That entire day I was hot and cold and had body aches. But no longer had vomiting. Then on Saturday, 3/13/2021 I woke up with a sore left armpit and neck but the armpit was way worse. I looked it up ?sore left armpit after covid vaccine? and it said swollen lymph nodes - so I?m guessing that?s what both pains were as my roommate who had the second dosage of Pfizer vaccine  the week before had a protruding lymph node on her neck. They both are still in pain until today 3/15/2021.

I became nauseous, sick and had seizure like episode and then I had tingling sensation in my face and limbs. They gave me shot epi-pen - two doses. I was pretty much paralyzed for hands and legs. I was brought to hospital and they treated me there for about a week and I had muscle weakness. I gained feeling back in my hands but not in my feet. I was at Haywood for a week. Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

                                                I received my shot at 11:47 and started to lose sensation in my hands in the waiting area. After about 25 minutes I felt dizzy and was about to stand up but my muscles started shaking. My heart rate was checked and found to be 140. This lasted for about another 30 minutes. My heart rate went down and I was taken to a private area and checked out by EMS they gave me water and concluded it was some sort of panic attack. However, these are the same symptoms I have whenever I am allergic to a medication, NSAIDS, dicyclomine, etc. It always starts with ascending numbness from my fingers to the rest of my body. Then I start to shake and my heart rate goes way up. Usually I start to cough then vomit and my airway closes. Thankfully this time we were able to slow the process and I never experienced some of the last symptoms.

Not exactly painful, but aching and deeply affecting. Almost itchy like all my muscles needed to stretch but they were also exhausted. All nerves in my body were highly activated, including my taste buds. Could not taste because I could taste everything and the food ended up feeling like individual particles rather than a cohesive flavor. Some nasal congestion. Overall, felt like being sick, but worse. Exhaustion Soreness in left arm

Developed slight cough at 9:00pm. I took Benadryl to help sleep through the night in case of any other side effects. Cough went away overnight, but my arm remained sore. I took Tylenol again on 3/26/2021 at 6:30am. At 7:00pm the same day, my left armpit began to feel sore which could not have been caused by anything other than vaccine as I haven?t been doing any physical activity. This worsened the next day, but I have not taken any Tylenol to alleviate it at this point.

I took my temperature around 1 pm today and had a fever of 100.8. Throughout today, my headache has gotten progressively worse. The pain is sharp at the base of my head and radiates down my spine. I cannot put my chin to my chest without excruciating pain. I have had migraines before and this does not feel the same. This headache is more localized in the back of my head and spine. I also have had COVID19 before at the beginning of July 2020 from which the only symptom I had was a loss of smell which returned 2 weeks after my positive COVID test.

A 22-year-old female patient started to receive BNT162B2 (lot number: EJ1685; expiry date unknown) intramuscular (right arm), on 28Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 vaccine injection/ vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. This nurse was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 28Dec2020, in the morning. Her first concern was that the nurse put the COVID-19 Vaccine injection really low into her right arm, but believes it did go into the muscle. She was concerned that it did not really go into her muscle but the more she has been lifting her arm and seeing where the shot was administered and where her muscle in her arm ends she believes it did go into the muscle. She contacted her primary care provider today because about 30 minutes to 1 hour after she was administered the COVID-19 vaccine injection on 28Dec2020 she had a pain in between her right scapula and spine, which is the side she got her vaccine on. She also reported that her right arm does not hurt at all, she has no pain at injection site for COVID-19 Vaccine which she finds really weird. She also felt the pain if she hunches her shoulders backwards, sits up really straight, crosses her arms or hunches forward; she does not really feel it if she takes a deep breath. She was wondering if these events are normal or expected or serious. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

Itching, swelling on my ears, arm, wrist, hands, back etc... took Benadryl for the 6 days and it helped for the 1st 2 days of my adverse event after that the Benadryl did nothing.

                                                First 36 hours post vaccine beginning about 7 hours after injection: Freezing cold shakes for several hours straight, fever of 101, vomiting (1x), diarrhea (8-10x, nausea, sweats, dizziness, muscle aches everywhere not just the injection site, incredibly stiff neck, migraine. Took ibuprofen in the middle of the first night and it helped a little. Fatigue and some reasonable arm pain and neck stiffness continued for a while. Migraine has continued since the vaccination; it&#39;s been 5 days. I&#39;ve had to take at least 2 Advil every day to help it. Can&#39;t even complete an aerobic workout even with the Advil because my head is shaking so much. I&#39;ve had mild migraines before surrounding my period, but they always disappear when I sleep and aren&#39;t there first thing in the morning like this has been. I feel so bad, I find myself having to keep stop walking during the day when completing a task just to hold my pounding head.  Not sure what to do.

It began to radiate to the left, and Wednesday I went to Urgent Care because I was scared. My EKG &amp; chest x-ray were clear. Today I feel even worse with migraines, chest pain (that radiates up my neck and around my back), and overall feeling gross and exhausted. My head is what?s bothering me the most along with my joint pain.

A 22-years-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine) Lot number=EL9262, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm,  on 25Jan2021 at 09:00 ( at the age of 22) as a single dose  for covid-19 immunisation.   There were no other vaccinations within 4 weeks. Medical history included Asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and insomnia.  Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (DAYSEE).

It was unknown if the patient tested for COVID-19 post-vaccination.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

                                                On April 5th, 2021 I went to the E.D. , for shortness of breath and severe right shoulder pain. While there they got a chest x-ray, ran labs, and did a chest CT. The CT revealed that I had one blood clot in my left lung and two blood clots in my right lung, as well as slight pleural effusion in the right lower lobe. They put me on Xarelto for the next 3-6 months and monthly follow up visits with my primary care provider. I was also given Hydrocodone as need. I experienced extreme pain with breathing and sort of movement for a week and half but currently only have occasional shoulder and back pain usually at the end of the day.

A 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 17Apr2021 at 09:10 (at the age of 22-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included penicillin allergy from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing, asthma from an unspecified date (diagnosed at 4 years old and it is usually controlled with medications) and ongoing and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome from 2019 and ongoing. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccination and did not receive any vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient previously received the flu shot on an unspecified date for immunization and experienced allergic to flu shot preservative and the patient previously received Biaxin on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication and experienced allergy. On 17Apr2021 at 09:12 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction and anaphylactic shock; on 17Apr2021 the patient experienced throat feels tight, ginormous rash on her daughter&#39;s face that comes and goes and then it will be on her chest , face, neck and shoulders and migrates wherever; on 18Apr2021 the patient experienced ginormous welts/rash or welt 1.5 inches by 1 inch on cheek, itching in back of throat; on 20Apr2021 the patient experienced dark purple on face; on 24Apr2021 the patient experienced some trouble breathing and chest pain; on 25Apr2021 the patient experienced a lot of bone pain; on 26Apr2021 the patient experienced white blood cell counts are all elevated and on unspecified dates the patient experienced face and neck swells, tachycardia, feels like she is having an asthma attack, blotch, blood counts continue to become worse and asthma worse. The reporter called to report that her daughter received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 17Apr2021 and that her side effects started two minutes later (also reported as 4 minutes later). The patient experienced anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. She stated that her daughter continued to have anaphylactic reactions and had to go to the hospital every day since then. The clinical course was reported as follows: her daughter and her husband went to get the vaccine together on 17Apr2021. They went to a facility giving the Pfizer vaccine, and the reporter stated that her daughter was asked, and she did tell them, that she could not receive the flu vaccine that had the additives in it because she was allergic to it. The reporter stated that her daughter was not taking the flu shot for years. She stated that her daughter was allergic to Biaxin but could take Zithromax because of the different additives. They had no idea what the preservative was, but it was obviously in the flu shot so they stopped getting the flu shot until they stopped putting the preservative in the vaccine. The reporter stated that her daughter received the COVID-19 vaccine and within two minutes her daughter told her dad that she was having a hard time breathing. Her daughter walked over to the city EMS who were on site and told them that she was having a hard time breathing. They treated her and then took her to hospital via ambulance. She was treated at the hospital and they were hesitant to discharge her because they were worried about her bounce back. This was exactly what has happened. Every night since the vaccine she has had to take her daughter into the hospital. Every day was a nightmare of either EpiPen injections, Tagamet, Benadryl or prednisone and ended up in the ER every day, where they give her IV Benadryl and send her home. The caller stated that her daughter&#39;s symptoms start with ginormous welts and then an itching to the back of the throat. She had seen a ginormous rash on her daughter&#39;s face that came and went and then it would be on her chest, face, neck and shoulders and migrated wherever. She saw dark purple on her daughter&#39;s face yesterday before she went to the ER. Her skin will blotch, and she will say that her throat feels tight like when she had a reaction to penicillin. She stated that her daughter used to get this when she they would give her penicillin; she would have that reaction every time she got penicillin and they finally said she was allergic to it. The caller states that after those symptoms started, she called EMS and they took her to a hospital. The caller stated she took her daughter to another hospital and they medicated her with IV Benadryl and fluids. Her primary care doctor told the emergency room staff to discharge the patient and that he would give her specific medications to go home with. He called in the medications, but they did not work. He gave her specific medication that did not work, half of her face was turning purple. The purple face was then replaced by an area approximately 1 inch wide on cheek between temple and the jaw. It was 1.5 inches long and was red and looked like a rash or welt. The patient would take an inhaler when she started to have breathing difficulties. That was when the reporter was like &#34;here she goes again&#34;. It felt like it almost made her asthma worse and had to treat that as well. There was a little oddity when they did blood work on her daughter and her white blood count was high and was probably her body reacting to the COVID-19 vaccine. So, she went back to the hospital. The nurses said there was nothing they could do for her, and she needed to find an allergist. The reporter stated that she was tired of the ER visits and wanted her daughter to get better. She stated that she doubled the dose of her daughter&#39;s Tagamet. She stated that the patient&#39;s face and neck swells and she would get tachycardia. The reporter stated that she would not take her daughter to the hospital anymore. The hospital did not think it could be related to the vaccine, but she had not done anything else. The reporter wanted to report this event because she did not think people were taking this seriously. She stated that no one believed it was related to the vaccine, so they were not getting help. She wanted to know if this was a side effect and what could she do about it. She also inquired on whether her daughter should get the second shot. She stated that her daughter would not get the second shot. She had heard that if you had any reaction to the vaccine, then you should not receive the second dose. Her daughter&#39;s doctors have told her to receive the second vaccine. The reporter also stated that she wondered if this was some mast cell activation due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The reporter also asked if Pizer made a preservative free vaccine. Upon follow-up received on 27Apr2021, the patient called to report that she was still experiencing side effects from the anaphylactic reaction and it had been 10 days since administration. She was told it would last about 4-10 days and then be gone, but it had continued, and it had been over 10 days. She had no new symptoms, other than a lot of bone pain. The bone pain made it feel like her bones were shattering. She went to the ER yesterday where they did blood work and said that all of her white blood cell counts were elevated. The anaphylaxis lasted from 17Apr2021 and subsided in that sense on 24Apr2021.  Since then she still had the chest pain, some trouble breathing, and felt like she was having an asthma attack. She had been back and forth to the ER several times since 17Apr2021. The ER kept ruling her symptoms as a reaction to the vaccine. She had been using epinephrine as needed. The patient stated that she was not planning on receiving the second dose due to her reaction. She wanted to know where she should go from here. She wanted to know if this would last forever and how much longer could her symptoms last. The clinical outcomes of the events ginormous welts/rash or welt 1.5 inches by 1 inch on cheek, itching in back of throat and a lot of bone pain were not recovered/not resolved; dark purple on face was recovered/resolved on 21Apr2021; outcomes of all other events were unknown.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height.

                                                Approximately 1 hour after receiving the  vaccine I developed tachycardia  that ranged between 130 and 95, this lasted from  01/08/2021 until 01/09 ~10 AM.  On 01/08  ~5 PM I began to develop  a fever that reached a peak of 102.4 at 4am (01/09), despite taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours. Last fever recorded 01/09 ~9PM of 99.5 (while still taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours).  Additional symptoms have been severe nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, bilateral lower back pain with some mild bruising to the kidney region, difficulty breathing,  chest pressure, shortness of breath along with a cough upon exertion (developed ~6 PM 01/08), which is still present today (01/10 1:25 PM), and an erythematous rash that covers the anterior side of the right forearm, from wrist to elbow (first noticed on 01/10 ~11 AM).

Treated with ibuprofen. 21 hours post vaccination was the peak of the symptoms, temperature of 101.6 with ibuprofen, strong body aches, weakness, and anorexia. Symptoms became more mild at hour 31 post vaccine. I had a swollen lymph node after the first vaccine above my left collarbone (injected on left side) and still have this, and now I have a swollen armpit that is very painful on my right side (injected on the right side).

I felt tired and had mild body aches until 3pm the  following day.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

Around 2am, 14 hours following the injection, I woke up with whole body muscle aches and a mild fever. Mild fatigue, muscle soreness and arm soreness continued into the next day.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

                                                First 2 days after vaccination, I had some injection site pain that was improving. Day 5 after vaccination, I developed lymphadenopathy on my left side with swelling into the chest area developing on day 6. Day 8 after vaccination, my injection site turned red and itchy and I began to have trouble breathing. I went to urgent care.  I saw P. A. She said that it was more likely that the difficulty breathing would be due to my asthma, but she could not recommend whether or not I should receive my second dose. She proscribed 20mg of Prednisone and refilled my albuterol prescription. About 20 hours later, my breathing is still difficult and my arm still itches.  We also discussed that the respiratory symptoms could be caused or exasperated by COVID-19, so I am waiting on results from a covid test.

                                                The night after I was vaccinated I experienced knee and ankle pain as well as soreness at the vaccination site (left arm/shoulder).  I experienced this throughout the night and this made sleeping difficult. The next morning, I took 2 500-mg tablets of acetaminophen. This relieved my pain for several hours. At about 1 pm, I became very fatigued. I slept the whole afternoon, ate dinner, took 2 more 500-mg tablets of acetaminophen, and slept for 11 hours. The next day, I felt good and have not had any symptoms since

                                                On 2/10/2021, two days after my 2nd dose, I started experiencing mild abdominal pain at around 10am. I knew it was a side effect from the vaccine for I had been experiencing severe chills, fever, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and nausea the day before (2/9/2021) and those symptoms except for the fever had subsided on the 10th. I had been unable to eat all day on the 10th due to the pain but it was manageable. At 2pm the abdominal pain got worse. At 4:30pm the pain became unmanageable and I could not walk erect without severe pain. I was crying and bend over trying to walk. I had a family member drive me to the ER and arrived at around 4:40pm.  Lying down with my knees up seemed to help the pain a bit but was exacerbated when lying flat or ambulating. I was given Pepcid, zofran,  and toradol all IV push  at 8pm and the pain subsided within 15 minutes. Today I still have mild abdominal pain but I would rate it at a 1/10.

I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

                                                The first day I got my vaccine, I felt  fine, but my arm with the injection sight was very sore and body slightly achy. The second day I woke up and my arm was sore, but other than that I felt normal. Around 4pm on the second day, my back started to hurt where the break break in my spine is. It was just a normal amount of pain at first, but within an hour there was throbbing pain in my lower back, spreading into my legs. This is where I normally feel my chronic pain, but I had a spinal injection a little over 6 months ago and doesn&#39;t usually stop working until about a year. It is the normal pain I experience in the normal places, but the pain is worse and out of no where. That is not usually how the pain comes on when the spinal block wears off. It is much more gradual. It could be a coincidence, but the pain is not the way I have ever experienced the pain.  My back hurts too much to do things I need to do to function, which only happens to me when I have done something with a lot of physical activity that puts tension on my back like jumping, dancing, roller coasters. Before I started experiencing this pain, it was just a normal day for me where I didn&#39;t exert my back any more than normal, which is very little.

It lasted a little over 5 hours until I took ibeuprofen.  Since then I have experience body aches and muscle weakness. Muscle weakness experienced especially in my extremities. Lastly, I woke up on 3/23 and had moderately severe pain below my ribs in my stomach. It most commonly occurred on my left side and was occasionally felt on my right.

Within 48 hours after vaccine was administered, all side effects had resolved except fatigue and swollen lymph nodes and headache.

Took 2 ibuprofens which helped the fever, but still had trouble sleeping. Later in the morning 8am, had same symptoms plus had 3 different sudden episodes of dizziness,  nausea, and light headedness. I had to physically sit down as it felt like I might pass out. From 9am-1pm the symptoms steadily decreased until there was just a bit of muscle weakness. I was taking ibuprofen every 6hrs.

                                                After receiving vaccine at 3 pm I started to have anxiety and my heart rate went up. This was presumably because I also have a needle phobia but I did almost faint and had to have on site EMT asses condition and observe for 30 minutes. At 4 pm one hour after injection face felt itchy and irritated and noticed hives on neck and jawline. Immediately administered benadryl 50 mg which made the hives subside.

                                                Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; Pain in arm; Joint pain; This is a solicited report from a contactable consumer (patient), via a non-Pfizer marketing program.  A 23-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscularly on an unspecified date as single dose for COVID-19 immunization and adalimumab (HUMIRA), subcutaneously from an unspecified date at unspecified dose for moderate to severe adult crohn&#39;s disease. Medical history included hemorrhage of colon from 2018 and moderate to severe adult crohn&#39;s disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, patient experienced postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, pain in arm and joint pain. The events were reported as serious, medically significant. The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. Outcome of event pain in arm was unknown while for all other events was recovered on an unspecified date. Causality assessment for the drug Humira and the events Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and Joint pain was reported as No reasonable possibility by the reporter and manufacturer while for the event Pain in arm was not reported by the reporter and No reasonable possibility by the manufacturer. Causality assessment for the drug BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) and the events postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, pain in arm and joint pain was not reported by the reporter.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of the vaccine BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be fully excluded based on the presumed temporal relationship and since it is part of the product safety profile. Underlying hemorrhage of colon and moderate to severe adult Crohn&#39;s disease may be contributory to the event orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Case will be  reassessed if additional information is received  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The fever went from 100.1 to 102.2 over the course of about an hour (11:30pm-12:30pm), at which time I took 400mg of ibuprofen. The fever was 102.1 thirty minutes after taking the ibuprofen. Along with the fever I experienced tachycardia, body and muscle aches, and moderate to severe deltoid pain at the injection site. I believe the fever broke around 3:00am. The fatigue and body aches lasted about 24 hours since they began, but the majority  of the rest of my symptoms were gone after the fever. The arm pain at injection site was noticeable and painful for about 72 hours before subsiding.

Later that night, I had very strong rigors, chills, severe headache and felt feverish. I took some Tyenol and felt a little better. I woke up at 5 AM to go to work, and my body was so fatigued and tired I couldn&#39;t move. My hands were shaking badly, and my whole body hurt. My joints hurt, my muscles, ect. I called out of work, as I work in the Micro lab doing COVID-19 PCR testing, I couldn&#39;t pipet correctly if I was shaking. I do not have any pre-existing conditions, and I have no allergies. I have never experienced an adverse reaction to a vaccine.

                                                Third day after receiving the vaccine I have been continuously experiencing sparatic and sharp pains mainly in my chest but also in my stomach and occasionally my back. It mainly shows up in my chest. Sharp and achey pains all in different spots at different times. This has been occurring now for 6 days and has not gotten better with time or any medicine I?ve been instructed to take by physician. Sometimes it throbs, sometimes it aches, sometimes it?s sharp and sudden. There is no consistency other than how painful it is. The pain has gotten more intense this evening 1/19/21. I have not experienced more than a half hour without any pain. It has been ongoing since 1/13/21. I woke up last night at 2:45am with a throbbing pain on the left side of my chest.

                                                The day after receiving my second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, I experienced minor side effects, including elevated temperature (99.8 F), headache, and soreness in my arm at the injection site.

                                                I received the vaccine around 9:00am on 1/22/2021, and around 7:30pm, I began running a low grade fever of 99.1 which is pretty high compared to my normal body temperature. I also experienced muscle soreness and chills. After taking Tylenol, the symptoms subsided. Around 3:15am on 1/23/2021, I woke up with a 101.2 degree fever along with more intense muscle soreness, chills, and light-headedness. I felt slightly nauseous and had a headache. I took Tylenol again to lower the fever. When I woke up around 8:00am, the symptoms were gone except for lingering fatigue.

On Friday the 22nd, this patient awoke with worsening chills and sudden nausea. She took her temperature, which was 100.5. This patient called employee health and asked if symptoms lasting  over 48 hours were ordinary or if she should be tested for COVID-19. Employee health informed patient to get tested in case of exposure. Patient was negative, however remained nauseous and had low grade fevers and aches. On the 23rd, patient awoke with severe nausea and vomiting. Patient called her primary care provider for zofran prescription, which was granted.  Zofran was taken around the clock until 1/26.

                                                I felt a little fatigued all day after the shot, but nothing more. As soon as 10pm (02/01/2021) came around I had a pounding headache. The most intense headache of my life. I also got an intense stomachache and it felt like I had an ulcer. That progressed to a low grade fever, chills, myalgia, and arthralgia. The myalgia and arthralgia were so intense that moving to stretch my legs was incredibly painful. I was also very nauseous. The intensity of the arthralgia and myalgia subsided around 8am on 02/01/2021. All my other symptoms continued until around 11am on 2/2/2021. I still have a headache and some muscle pain, but they are manageable.

Next morning 1/28 very sore leg muscles, hot flashes, headache. As day went on my limbs were tingling and had some numbness.  Increasingly getting fatigue and wasn&#39;t able to keep my head up for more than 30sec with out it falling. By 5p I could not move left arm at all and called PCP office and went to ER. Over 5 hours I got  feeling back in left arm and left ER at 10:30p. CT was done to rule out stroke or other injury. Next day around 2p my right arm started to get more numb and I wasn&#39;t able to move it much. SOB and throat tightening came back briefly. Later that day lumbar puncture done to rule out guillain barre syndrome. Numbness is not as severe now 2/3 and each day since 1/28 it gets increasingly less

                                                I had several adverse side effects from the vaccine (which I was expecting given it was my second dose). I woke up with a slight fever that lasted two days (highest point being 102.5*F, but it ebbed and flowed throughout the period). I had nausea (threw up twice, was able to keep food down by the evening of the first day after getting the vaccine). I had chills as well, and standard body aches and headaches that often accompany fevers and chills. My arm was also sore at the injection site, as with most vaccines, but it was actually bizarrely most sore at my armpit, not at the injection site.

I tried to rest and take ibuprofen but nothing was helping the pain and I went to my health center a week after I received the vaccine and they said I was having too much of a localized inflammatory response and to alternate between ibuprofen and tylenol and use heat but the pain is still there and it&#39;s been almost 3 weeks.

                                                I got my Pfizer first dose today and it was fine at first, but four hours later I was slammed with incredible arm and shoulder pain. I have a really high pain tolerance (tore my meniscus 3x with no surgery or pain meds, wasn&#39;t too bad) and I&#39;m 24F, not on any medications. I keep reading that sore arms are common, but this is a 6/7 on the pain scale. Putting on joggers was excruciating and I almost vomited. I can&#39;t even bring a glass to my mouth with that arm. Even laying as still as possible hurts. I cannot lift my arm past my pelvis and my shoulder is immobile. I feel nauseous when I move it.  I haven&#39;t seen this experience anywhere so I am puzzled... I&#39;m fully vaccinated w/ everything else and the closest to this was the tetanus shot, which hurt but not like - this - level of pain. I&#39;m getting a bit concerned that the person who did it (in a hundred car drive thru) missed the deltoid and shot it into my shoulder?? It&#39;s VERY high on my arm. I believe in this vax 100% but I can&#39;t believe the pain I&#39;m having and why it&#39;s not mentioned anywhere.  Like I am so so grateful for this vax and am in awe of the science -- and everyone should get it   -- but I just don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m in literal excruciating pain :( Moving it even slightly feel like I&#39;m ripping it from the bone.   It?s now been 20 hours and the pain is worse than ever, even breathing, sneezing or bending over causes searing pain.

The onset of symptoms had no cause and occurred two days following the first dose of the vaccine. I had a similar event occur 10 years prior on the right leg, with no obvious cause, requiring surgery. And since have been diagnosed with Mast Cell Activation Disorder in 2015.

After extubation, I continued to have anaphylaxis at least once a day with no correlation to what I was eating or drinking. I also began having a severe auto immune flare up with body pains in my legs, back, and stomach immobilizing me with generalized weakness.

These symptoms have lasted for over seven weeks and are so bad to the point I cannot eat or sleep and have sought out emergency medical attention. In this same time period, I got what my doctors believe is Eosinophilic Esophagitis where my throat is now chronically inflamed, making it difficult to swallow. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue, anxiety, and mood swings when I never had a history of this.  I have tried taking several medications and PPI&#39;s with no success as well as trying every type of diet and lifestyle change possible with no success. I have not recovered from this and expect it will be some time before I do.

The soreness continued to get worse throughout the rest of the day after administration. The next day, muscle soreness was significantly reduced and by the end of the day (1/8/21) it was completely resolved.

                                                Almost exactly 12 hours after receiving the second dose of COVID vaccine, I woke up from sleep curled into a ball, covered in sweat, absolutely freezing, teeth chattering, and all my muscles were shaking violently. I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

                                                tingling reaction on her arms, body/tingling in the hands and arms; swelling of the face; headaches; she had numbness in the face and tingling; weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness; fatigue; in the back, she had pain, soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down; in the back, she had pain, soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down; she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days.; a bump on her forehead with a high temperature; a bump on her forehead with a high temperature/ it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer sponsored program. A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) and a non-contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. After a few days on 25Dec2020, patient started to experience reactions, like a tingling reaction on her arms, body, and also swelling of the face, and she also started to have headaches. It has been like that for a while, and patient who is a health care professional was brought to the emergency room, to check on what was going on, but she was not able to get the medication they need, it was twice that the consumer he tried to bring the patient to emergency, and she still hasn&#39;t gotten medication for the symptoms. She started having reactions, she had numbness in the face and tingling,  headaches, tingling in the hands and arms, and weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness, she felt like fatigue and also in the back, she had pain and soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down. She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Intermittent fevers and headaches/head pressure that have continued for 6 days post vaccination.   Side effects of muscle aches/chills subsided after 48 hours. Fever was less than 100F after 48 hours, so I returned to work per protocol. Was taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen.    3rd day: afebrile but headache remained. Taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen to help manage.   4th day: intermittent fevers throughout day (no higher than 100.3F). headache continues.   5th day: afebrile in the morning, but as day progressed headache began to get worse and I eventually spiked a low grade fever as high as 101.5F that afternoon. I was excused from work per protocol and receiving care/evaluation from occupational heath and infectious disease for return to work purposes. Still taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen which were helping the fevers stay between 99F but not helping the headaches.   6th day: Taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen around the clock. Fevers have ranged from 98.9-100.8F so far. Headache still remains.

I have had no sudden stressful events/changed in diet/change in activity. Following the vaccine I had moderate lower back and right lower quadrant abdominal pain that I wrote off as maybe something I ate. This cramping pain did not cease and stayed at a severity of 4/10.  I did not take over the counters for relief. Upon wakening the the next day I found I had bled through my under garmets and had a severe headache. This went away as the day professed and I did not have any more break through bleeding since.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

Took Ibuprofen 400mg still was feeling the numbness and took another Ibuprofen 200mg  around 1400 for the still felt slight numbness.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl around 1700 because I still was feeling the slight numbness on right side of face. In the morning was not noting any improvement in the facial numbness and was feeling that the cheek muscles were tighter on the right side and causing subtle facial asymmetry.  I got worried and went to the ED. I was assessed,  diagnosed with facial paresthesia.  I was offered an MRI, I declined as I did not feel that I needed it at the time. Provider prescribed 40 mg of prednisone daily for 5 days, valacyclovir 1000mg  3 times a day for 7 days. After starting prednisone facial muscle tightness I was feeling improved, still felt slight numbness more so in the mornings the next 2 days. I took the full course of prednisone, I am no longer feeling the facial symptoms. I stopped taking valacyclovir on day 3, since I felt that the prednisone was what is helping and it was harder to evenly take it 3 times a day.

                                                I sat at the hospital for 15 mins after my vaccine shot and was ok. However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

I could not lift my right arm, I was exhausted doing everyday things.  Sunday- migraine wouldn?t go away. I got body chills but it wasn?t until later at night. And my body aches became moderate.  Monday- my migraine went down to a headache but my body aches wouldn?t go away. I did not take any pills. Throughout the day. I was tired. It was hard moving around. I was kind of sluggish but not as much as Tuesday. Tuesday- severe body aches. Both my arms hurt but I thought it was just due to laying in bed after getting home from work at 2:30 on Monday. Severe pain in my shoulders and middle of my back. I did some stretches thinking maybe my body was just sore from laying down. Went to bed at 12 because I couldn?t keep warm and my back was killing me.  Wednesday- horrible ache though out my back I got up to move but it hurt so much. I?m walking so slow. I need to rest on the walls because it hurts so much to move. My headache is still there. I took midol at 1:30pm;  did not do much. I?ve been trying to move about and stretch but my body does not allow me. Even typing hurts I cannot keep a good grip on things. My arms, entire left side of my back and many thighs  are in pain

A 25-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 13Jan2021 at 08:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included anxiety. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) from 2018 and ongoing (for two-and-a-half years) for anxiety. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EK5730) on 22Dec2020 at 09:00 AM (in the right arm) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was calling to report side effects. After the second dose on 13Jan2021, the patient noticed around 18:00 that the muscles in her back became stiff and tight. It got worse overnight and, in the morning (14Jan2021), she had to walk bent over. This stiffness progressed to her whole body. That morning she also noticed her hands felt tingly (like when they fall asleep) and she had a migraine with vomiting and dizziness. All of these effects started to resolve but now her muscles are still very sore (Jan2021). The migraine went away this morning as did the vomiting and dizziness. The patient recovered from &#34;Hands felt tingly&#34;, &#34;Migraine&#34;, &#34;Vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Dizziness&#34; on 15Jan2021. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Muscles are still very sore&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Had to walk bent over&#34; was unknown. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, and low blood sugar. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had rash on her face, chest, and arms on 08Jan2021 (10 minutes after the vaccination), puking on 09Jan2021, she did have a fever during the vomiting in Jan2021, red knot on her arm in Jan2021, her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm in Jan2021, have a black bruise in Jan2021, a red dot/red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch in Jan2021. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 11Jan2021, of other remain events was unknown. Clinical course: She says after she got the shot on 08Jan2021  she developed a rash about 10 minutes after on her face, chest, arms, and they gave her a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) shot and monitored her for about half an hour-45 minutes and then they let her go home and told her husband to monitor her through the weekend. Then Saturday (09Jan2021) morning she began puking and she kept puking through Monday and she still has knot about a week and a half later, a red knot but other than that she feels better. She did have a fever during the vomiting and she did have a black bruise and a red dot in the middle. She says it was red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch and it went away by Friday and then it popped back up Saturday but she feels fine. It was weird that it went away and then a week after on Saturday it popped back up. She has a picture of it, it came back and her arm felt sunburnt all day feel but she feels fine. She has never had all this happen before. It was so weird the nurse was calling to check in Saturday morning and she was telling her at about noon she felt okay she felt better than she did when she had the rash but then she just started puking. The vomiting stopped Monday 11Jan2021. She called to try to get an appointment and they told her that some people are having that reaction, like people that have the rash are having that happen. Her mother in law is having her take a picture of her arm everyday and send it to her, she is just one of those people. It went away everything healed there was a big back bruise it went away and then Saturday all of sudden it came back and her arm was burning, she would say her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm. She says she did report her symptoms through Vsafe she is not sure if that is Pfizer or not. She went online and use the paper work they gave her to scan the thing. She does not have a reference number to provide from that she is not sure if that is through Pfizer. She was a pharmacy tech but she did not handle prescriptions in high school so she does not think that counts. She has never had a reaction, she had an allergic reaction to tick fever but everyone gets a rash from that she gets a rash from dryer sheets but she has never had any issues with medications or vaccines. She says she has the packet they gave her. She has the vaccine in her car, she is an auditor working from home so she can go get it out of the car. She was planning on getting a second shot but now she is not sure she is thinking maybe she shouldn&#39;t because they are saying a lot of people that have this reaction have an anaphylactic reaction the second time so she does not know if she will get it or not. She is told she is high risk so she was getting the shot because she is scared to get COVID she thinks she may would have to go in the hospital or something so she does as much as she can, staying away from people and always wearing a mask. They get groceries delivered and food delivered.

Intense muscle aches, worse two days after the vaccine, instead of just one day after. Aching of the muscles around the eyes (the ones you would use to squint and the top of the cheeks), the scalp, neck (the base of the skull and trapezius), biceps, aching around the wrist joints, hip flexors, quadriceps, and ankle joints. Found relief with 500 mg acetaminophen throughout the day.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Monday, March 15th around 9:30/10:00am I began to feel nauseous, had a headache, felt cold and overall tired. I had to stop working and I laid down to rest and slept for 4-5 hrs. Continued to feel weak with a loss of appetite for the remainder of the day and slept through the night.  Tuesday, March 16th I began work around 8am and by 9:20am I had to stop due to a pounding headache and extreme nausea and muscle aches in my back. My eyes were sensitive to light, my head hurt and felt a lot of pressure in the front of my head and back of my neck and my  ears were beginning to hurt and ring. I took acetaminophen and slept for 3-4hrs. When I woke up the nausea had subsided but I still had a lingering headache, just not as terrible, and took additional acetaminophen 500mg. This headache continued for the rest of the day into the night, waking me up to the point of needing another 500mg acetaminophen and waking up the next morning Wednesday, March 17th with still a slight lingering headache, slight sensitivity to light, light nausea, light muscle/body ache, and general feeling of weakness.

Then, she complained of extreme muscle pains, all over; itching and shortness of breath with formation of mucus in her chest.  She has interstitial lung disease and is well aware of what mucus-filling in her chest (lungs) feels like.  She also had headache and coughing and this necessitated using Benadryl 50mg, her Xopenex rescue inhaler at the site; followed by contacting of her pulmonologist for future treatment and instructions.

I recieved the injection in my right arm. It was a dull achey pain but upon palpation became a sharp shooting pain that radiated from my armpit into my back and under my ribcage. There was also swelling and it to hurt have my right arm resting along my side.  Today, on 4/2/21, I am still experiencing this pain, however, it is less severe. To treat, I have been taking 2 acetominaphen approximately every six hours. It still hurts if I am to rest my arm at my side.

                                                Swelling and redness of the arm within an hour after the vaccine. Tingling began in middle, ring, and pinky fingers within 20 minutes of injection. Numbness began within the first hour. Within two hours, I lost strength and 60% use of my left hand. The pinky and ring finger of my left hand have been either completely numb or tingling ever since my shot over one week ago.   I noticed mild numbness about 3-4 days after the first dose, but assumed I had just slept funny. When my arm became red and hand became tingly after my second dose, I realized this was an effect of the vaccine and not merely a pinched nerve in my sleep.

                                                14 hours after the vaccine was received, I woke up so uncomfortable, no matter how I moved I couldn?t get comfortable. It was the kind of uncomfortable where I swear I could feel it in my bones. Laid in bed until 8:30 when baby boy woke up, promptly threw up, got so nauseated and dizzy that I could not move from the bathroom floor, and had to ask grandma to bring me my medicines. The mix of ibuprofen, migraine medication, and anti-nausea all combined made me feel no symptoms for several hours until they wore off and I lost all ability to stand. My legs just felt so weak. And now I?m finally starting to feel a little better, and it?s been 2.5 days now. Boy, those side effects are no joke. Still worth it though so I don?t bring a deadly virus home to my baby boy ?????
