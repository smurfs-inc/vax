                                                Pain between the breasts on the ribs. Started out as seconds of slight pain the day after shot until about 9:30pm when the pain became consistent but was a slight pain. I woke up at 2:30am and my chest hurt really badly. It was a constant pain but the amount of pain was back and forth. It hurt more to lay down and if I bent down it was very painful. I stayed up for an hour and a half until the pain went away. When it did I had sweat a lot and was very hot.  I then woke up with little discomfort until an hour after I woke up with slight pain. The pain then has gone off and on but not as painful as it was during the night.

A few minutes later she struggled to make a fist with her same hand and reported having pain going up her neck. The injection site did swell up a few minutes after the injection as well and she felt tingling in her hands shortly after. Patient was given 25 mg of benadryl after she reported the tingling in her hands. She did not have any difficulty breathing though. She was able to stand up and walk with her parent to the car and was driven to ER by parent to be checked out.

Within several days of receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose #2, patient began experiencing worsening/flare of ulcerative colitis symptoms including stomach pain, diarrhea, fatigue, arthritis pain that lasted beyond the reasonable and known duration of vaccine related side-effects. Symptoms treated with dicyclomine and acetaminophen with no relief.  Symptoms continued x 2 weeks.  Patient ultimately required addition of budesonide to treatment regimen for ulcerative colitis and is currently having relief of symptoms.

                                                The patient felt tired and describes her eyes going dark, then passed out a few minutes after vaccination.  She was vaccinated and then left the immunization room to sit down for a 15 minute waiting period.  When she went to sit down, she collapsed on the floor.  Her mother assisted her into a chair.  She continued to be incoherent and have her eyes rolling back into her head for a few minutes.  We used a cool cloth on her forehead and the back of her neck.  The parents requested that we call 911.  EMS arrived shortly and evaluated her.  Heart rate, blood pressure, pulse ox, blood sugar and chest sounds were all within normal range.  The patient stated that her arm felt heavy and &#34;funny&#34;.  She then stated that her tongue felt funny.  EMS evaluated her tongue and said it looked normal.  To err on the side of caution, she was taken to the hospital to determine whether or not she was having a delayed onset anaphylactic reaction.  This patient has no history of seizures.

                                                12 hours post vaccine she had severe myalgia, rash on both arms and legs, headache, nausea, stomach pain, and mild swelling in legs. Over the next 48 hours the rash darkened and spread to the entire body causing pain in her skin. The myalgia became nearly unbearable and both Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen didn&#39;t put a dent in the pain. One side of her face swelled so that one eye could only partially open. The nausea and stomach pain worsened so that she couldn&#39;t eat. Headache became intense. By 48 hours post vaccine she became delirious - her speech was slurred and difficult to comprehend. She would fall asleep for a few minutes and wake up unaware of where she was or what was happening. She never got a fever but did have chills. Around this time I called a relative who is a doctor to seek advice and Diphenhydramine was recommended. Benedryl helped immensely. 30 minutes after taking it she could speak clearly, was more alert, pain became tolerable, and her appetite returned. Symptoms and swelling returned when the Benedryl wore off so she continued taking it every 4 hours for the next two days until it wasn&#39;t necessary any more. The myalgia, stomach pain and headache persisted for 7 days. At 8 days post vaccine (today) a mild headache, mild and intermittent stomach pain, and mild fatigue are her only remaining symptoms. Her pediatrician cannot see her until next week but we have an appt for the 22nd.

                                                Patient started experiencing numbness and tingling on her right side and then all over on Sunday evening 5/2/21. It affected her gait and the numbness and tingling in her legs caused her to have to catch herself and hold on to something to keep from falling. She described that her legs felt weak for a few seconds when walking. This sensation gradually decreased in intensity and duration. When I saw her at 5 pm on 5/3, she had normal gait and only felt the numbness and tingling very briefly. Her exam including her neuro exam was normal on 5/3 when I saw her.  The sensation of numbness and tingling completely resolved by 5/4.  She also experienced HA, nausea and fatigue, but did not have syncope, dizziness or fevers.

My joints were hurting, I had somewhat severe nausea, my head started throbbing. At about 6:40 AM my migraine started, my arm felt hot to the touch, and I got dizzy so I took some acetaminophen. At 10:00 PM I noticed the area under my left armpit was a little swollen and really sore, my throat and right tonsil was also sore and it hurt to swallow. The next day (today) I have another migraine, my throat and left armpit are still sore,  and my muscles hurt. I?m getting better though.

                                                Vaccine administered at outside facility. Patient is a 16 yo girl, admitted on 4/19 with myocarditis, s/p IVIG (4/19) after presenting with progressive new onset chest pain. She was in usual state of health up until 2 days ago when she started developing body aches, and chest pain. Patient received her 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine last week (4/15). No known history of COVID infection. Parents brought her to the ED yesterday after she complained of dizziness, SOB, chest pain, and had a near syncopal event. EKG showed non-specific ST abnormalities with labs showing elevated troponin, mildly elevated CRP, normal CXR, negative COVID PCR. Denies fever, GI symptoms, GU symptoms, headache, rash. Once transferred to our PICU, she was worked up for myocarditis vs MIS-C. Troponin has been trended q6 and is trending up (now 11). Of note, there have been no fevers. Patient is a 16 yo girl, s/p admission (4/19-4/23/21) with myocarditis, s/p IVIG (4/19), has now been readmitted on 5/10 with myocarditis after presenting with headache and neck pain for 2 days. Following discharge from the PICU on 4/23, patient states that symptoms have lingered (low grade fevers, feeling tired, on and off chest pain). After developing a progressive headache and neck pain, she came back to the ER for re-evaluation. Upon readmission, her troponin was elevated (2.06 on 5/10). Her CBC and CMP were reassuring. Blood culture collected on 5/11 and urine culture collected on 5/10. ID consulted for workup.

                                                Patient admitted with myocarditis s/p dose #2 of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  At the time of the report, she is still hospitalized. From EHR note: Patient was in her usual state of health when she received her second dose of the Pfizer mRNA Covid vaccine on 6/3.  She experienced mild myalgias in the day following the vaccine.  However, on 6/5 she developed new severe substernal chest pain, dizziness, and dyspnea.  Pain radiated to her throat.  Given severity of pain, she presented to the emergency department.  In the ED she was afebrile, tachycardic, and initially hypertensive.  Labs demonstrated WBC 10.9 (N 49, L 27), Hb 11.7, PLT 315.  ESR 25, CRP 7.61.  Troponin T was mildly elevated at 0.08, consistent with mild cardiac inflammation.  SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing were negative. An EKG was normal. However, an echo demonstrated low-normal LVEF (55%).  Otherwise, patient denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, new rashes, arthralgias. Patient was admitted to the cardiology service for further monitoring.  Following admission, she was started on ibuprofen.  She notes that her substernal chest pain has improved somewhat since admission.  Differential for patient&#39;s presentation includes infectious, post-infectious, and non-infectious causes of myocarditis. Although post-vaccination mild myocarditis seems likely, we agree with the infectious workup already undertaken, and recommend additional EBV and CMV PCR testing.

                                                The rash first started on her hands on 4/2 and was originally attributed to powdered gloves she used during her job at a restaurant. She had her wisdom teeth out on 3/24 and started amoxicillin and steroids for the wisdom teeth on 3/25. She had her first COVID vaccine on 3/30 with arm pain only on 3/31.  She was seen in the urgent care on 4/4 . Rash felt to be due to amoxicillin or contact dermatitis (gloves). She stopped amoxicillin. The rash has continued to evolve. Originally maculopapular and only on hands, nby 4/13  there was both a maculopapular rash in addition to urticarial lesions primarily on her lower extremities, but also present on her trunk and in her groin. It is intensely pruritic. It seems to change over time, though the family is not entirely sure about that. Certainly, they describe confluent erythema and swelling over her right ankle the morning  of 4/13 which was not present by the time she saw me that afternoon. She has had ankle arthralgias as well.    as of 4/16, rash is gone other than feet.

                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

We were to start ibuprofen and ice, avoid any touching of the area, and monitor it for a few days. That was Monday, and it is now Friday. The lump is still there but it is slightly less painful. If it isn&#39;t better by Monday, we will see the pediatrician.

It then included both sides of her face; patient could not open her eye or control her face; her left leg had goosebumps and chills; her left leg had goosebumps and chills; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 17-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8731) via an unspecified route of administration on 07Apr2021 at 15:15 (at the age of 17-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event was reported as none. Concomitant mediations included ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (JOLESSA) taken &#34;to decrease her periods&#34; from 2019 (&#34;about two years ago&#34;) and ongoing and at an unspecified dose, cyclic, for three months straight with no placebo. Then takes a placebo pill for one week straight and biotin taken &#34;for hair and nail growth&#34; from an unspecified date (&#34;she began taking within the last 6 months&#34;) and ongoing. There was no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine, there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. It was not provided whether there were adverse events following prior vaccinations. On 07Apr2021 the patient experienced began having left eye twitches and they progressed to spasms and the nose and left side of her face. It then included both sides of her face, patient could not open her eye or control her face, her left leg had goosebumps and chills, pinching in her left shoulder, nausea and headache. The reporter called to report that her daughter had a severe reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in her left arm. Less than an hour after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed goosebumps and chills in her left leg. The reporter was not very concerned about it at the time. About 9:00PM that same night, the patient started complaining of pinching in her left shoulder. The reporter was not too terribly concerned. By 9:30PM, that same night, the patient started to have left eye twitches. Then they increased to eye spasms, then the patient could not open her eye or control her face. Then, it progressed to patients nose and left side of her face. At that point, the reporter tried to contact a nurse with the health insurance advice line. She waited for 30 minutes. The patient&#39;s symptoms continued to get worse, so the reporter took the patient to the emergency room. While the patient was in the emergency room triage, while hospital staff were getting her blood pressure and temperature, her symptoms also started to involve the right side of her face. Around 10:15PM, that same night, the patient started to get nauseous and a headache kicked in. The emergency department took patient straight back to a room. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The emergency department started an IV on the patient, and they administered Reglan, Benadryl, and Toradol to treat her symptoms. The emergency department ran blood tests, preformed a urinalysis and a CT scan. The reporter did not know what all blood testing that was done revealed; however, the reporter did know that they told her that none of the testing revealed anything and were all normal. The patient was eventually discharged from the emergency department at about 1:50AM. She was sent home with Butalbital, for headache and was advised to take ibuprofen. She was still having the twitching but not as bad when discharged. On 08Apr2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had not completely subsided, but were significantly better. On 08Apr2021, the patient woke up with nausea, chills and a headache. The reporter expected the patient to have these side effects. The side effects continued until very late in the day on 10Apr2021. The patient never vomited, was only very nauseous. The reporter also stated that when the woman was administering the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the woman said &#34;oops&#34; and it was not explained what &#34;oops&#34; meant. The reporter asked if it was possible that the patient received the dose subcutaneously and that was why she had these side effects. The reporter also stated that the second dose was scheduled for 28Apr2021 and she asked if the patient should receive the second dose. The clinical outcomes of the events began having left eye twitches and they progressed to spasms and the nose and left side of her face. It then included both sides of her face, patient could not open her eye or control her face, her left leg had goosebumps and chills, pinching in her left shoulder, nausea and headache all recovered/resolved on 10Apr2021.

She then said she had tingling in her fingers, which progressed to difficulty moving her fingers/stiff fingers, and coldness and redness in tips of fingers. She then reported she was loosing sensations in her feet and legs. 911 was called. We tried to have the patient take slow deep breaths. We offered an ice pack and water up front and a heat pack for her fingers. Paramedics arrived. Her blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, glucose were within normal limits. She was given oxygen and the paramedic was able to help her slow her breathing. Her fingers went back to normal and she felt fine before leaving. She did not feel the need to go with the paramedics.

My arm stayed sore and hard to use all day and at night about 7:30 - 8:00 a sharp pain started lancing through my thigh to my knee, after a half hour or so it moved to include down to my ankle, then spaced out between the three randomly till about nine wen it moved to my side for about twenty minutes or so before becoming a dull throb in my leg till I fell asleep.  The next day I felt a slight ickyness that last off and on all day as well as a light headache that got worse in the evening.

Client drank some water, declined snack. Clients hand began to shake, RN offered to lay client on a cot but client declined. Her dad came to check on her, she broke down saying that her arms were numb and chest was tight. The 15 vaccine minute timer went off, client stood but legs were week. She sat down and then slid herself onto the floor. She at first went into a fetal position then laid out flat on the floor. Client began acting more panicked and frantic with short quick breaths and her hands appeared to be contracting some. Clinic team made the decision to call 911 and administer 0.50 mg epinephrine.

                                                Patient was very anxious and breathing heavy. About 5 minutes after the vaccination they started to hyperventilate and ended up throwing up. After letting them sit and relax for 5 minutes, the patient then had to throw up again and told their mother they felt like they were going to faint. Mother and myself stood by, while patient did end up fainting. We slowly lowered them to the ground, and on the way down their body got stiff and patient had uncontrollable movements and was hardly responsive. Mother and myself finally got her safely to the floor as they came to and was responding to verbal ques and stimulation from mother. Mother went to get water and i stayed with the patient to ensure no other things happen. Patient ended up doing alright after relaxing for a few and then i walked them and mother to their car and ensured they were feeling good enough to go home. I then advised the mother to seek medical attention.

A 17-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Colitis ulcerative from 2014 and ongoing, Genetic immune deficiency, additional Information for other conditions: Caller describes it as &#34;22q&#34;. patient was born with this but wasn&#39;t actually diagnosed until patient was 11 years old. They checked with patient&#39;s Immunologist before getting the vaccine especially with her daughter&#39;s history. Thyroid disease from 2015 to an unknown date, additional Information for other conditions: patient didn&#39;t have a thyroid- her thyroid was removed. Concomitant medications included cetirizine; famotidine; montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR); and epinephrine (EPIPEN) all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aloe vera, pramocaine hydrochloride (ATARAX ANTI ITCH LOTION) taken for itching, swelling and hives, start and stop date were not reported. The patient took first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12Mar2021 10:00 (Lot: EN6207) for COVID-19 immunization and patient had no side effects after the first dose. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient just saw her Immunologist and her Immunologist instructed her to report what is going on with patient. Caller clarifies patient&#39;s immunologist plans to call and report as well but also instructed her to call and report the side effects her daughter is experiencing. Her daughter was cleared to have the COVID vaccine. The caller explains they always check with her immunologist because of her daughter&#39;s immune issues. Her daughter received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 02Apr2021. On the evening of 04Apr2021, her daughter broke out in hives. They didn&#39;t think it was a big deal, they thought it was just an allergic reaction. She tried Benadryl and several other things. They went and saw her daughters regular general practitioner and the doctor believed it was just a delayed skin reaction, which seems to be common with the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The doctor told her he&#39;s seen one other person with this delayed reaction. He gave her daughter a steroid injection, a Steroid Dose Pack and Pepcid. She was also placed on Benadryl as needed. About 2 weeks after this, her daughter and lip and face swelling and ended up in the Emergency Room (ER). At this ER visit, they initiated the allergic reaction protocol and it was not an anaphylactic reaction at that point. Her daughter received IV Benadryl and IV steroids, the caller is not sure what else. She confirms she has no NDC, Lot number and expiry dates for the medication her daughter received in the ER. The ER doctor contacted the Immunologist on call and the Immunologist had seen a few cases with a delayed reaction. Caller clarifies the ER doctor discussed her daughter&#39;s delayed skin reaction with the on-call Immunologist. The oncologist put her daughter on generic Zyrtec, 20mg in the morning and 20mg at night. The following week, her daughter woke her up with facial and tongue swelling. She clarifies further her daughter had fever, joint pain, and had broken out in a rash that moved to her face and lips. She immediately took her to the ER. The ER followed the whole anaphylaxis protocol and was given an EpiPen. She explains her daughter was diagnosed serum/covid sickness. This has been going on for over 6 weeks. The reaction will come and go. She was told as her daughter&#39;s body develops immunity, she is basically allergic to it. She clarifies at her ER visits, they checked her daughters liver and kidneys. It was noted her daughter had and elevated CRP, which is an inflammatory marker. The caller was told they thought her daughter had serum sickness from the vaccine which may last 4-6 weeks or it may be prolonged, so they just went with it. They told her as long as it didn&#39;t move to her lips or affect her daughters breathings, eventually it would wax and wane and go away. Her daughter started breaking out on her arms and legs and last Saturday, she woke up and her face was swelling. She clarifies her daughter&#39;s eye started to swell and her tongue. She took her straight to the ER and the ER followed the anaphylaxis protocol and injected her with an EpiPen. They contacted her Immunologist to check and make sure it wasn&#39;t anything else and consulted with the Covid Vaccine Clinic and it was found 3 other patients had this happen. No further details were provided regarding the 3 other patients. Right now, her daughter is on 4 different medications and an EpiPen. They contacted her insurance about her being placed on a biologic because not even the current medications her daughter is on is making everything going away. Caller verifies her daughter was never admitted into the hospital. When she was last seen in the ER Monday, she her daughter was monitored for 4 hours after the EpiPen was administered. The events require a visit to Emergency Room (total of three ER visits) and Physician Office. She known the last/third ER visit was Monday, 17May2021. The second ER visit was 04May2021. She believes the initial/first ER visit was probably a week or so before the second one. She clarifies she broke out in hives on 04 Apr2021 and went to the doctor on 07Apr2021 or 08Apr2021 so the ER visit was around the next week. Since her daughter had such a good response from the EpiPen the ER doctor took pictures before and after. She clarifies the name of the biologic they want to put her daughter on is Xolair, it is a monthly injection. She explains the current cocktail they have her daughter on is not working. She provides the following product information for these 4 medications and EpiPen. Relevant Tests included she knows they are testing for any other thing that it could be to rule it out. She knows they ran a CIS-tray, a complete CIQ , a Histamine release something and Tryptase. She knows they checked her CRP (inflammatory marker) because it was elevated. Every time her daughter went to the ER, they did a CBC and all of that was normal except for the CRP inflammatory marker, however her CRP was normal at the last ER visit. The outcome of events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Later on that day, I was feeling my neck and I felt a giant lump on the left side of my neck. I thought that I had slept on it wrong. Later on, it wouldn&#39;t go away - even with massage. It was painful. It caused disturbance, I wasn&#39;t comfortable when I was sleeping. It had gotten bigger the next morning. Our doctor said that it was lymph nodes and it was a response of immune system to injection. To make sure, I&#39;m getting an ultrasound. It has gone done but I still notice another smaller lump there still as well. (The two lumps are side by side.)  For the pain and swelling, the doctor prescribed me ibuprofen. This has calmed it down. It was still a little swollen - about two weeks after. But it&#39;s going down little by little. I still feel it, but it&#39;s now very small.

                                                The day after the second dose of the vaccine she started to have pains in all of her joints. Her chest felt painful and even her finger joints.  It was a constant pain that got worse with movement. The pain scale without the medication was an 8 but with the medication a 5 on the scale of 1-10. Ibuprofen and Hydrocodone helped control the pain but it did not make it totally go away. The joint pain lasted for three weeks to date but the chest pain has improved. Heat pads also help. She has never experienced these symptoms before. There were similar symptoms after the first vaccine but it is much more intense after the second dose. It has been consistent since the second dose of the vaccine but the medication and heat application does seem to help. Hospital after the first dose for chest pain.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Feb2021 10:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to Red dye, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), heart murmur, Wilkies syndrome. The patient was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not take other medications in two weeks. The patient previously took Excedrin and experienced allergies. The patient previously received first dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Feb2021 09:45 AM (Lot Number: EL9269) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. On 24Feb2021 at around 7:00pm she started getting a migraine at the base of her head. She then was lethargic, and became extremely nauseous. She started getting extremely cold and then hot within a matter of minutes (inability to control temperature regulation). Her heart rate rose to around 133 just laying down. Her ribs and lungs hurt. And her stomach began to have a really intense stabbing pains. At one point it felt as if she could feel every cell in her body if that makes sense. Not the worst pain she had experienced but definitely not pleasant. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being run over by a car and 1 being a paper cut) she would say it was a 5-6. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Facility type vaccine was facility. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and did not have COVID test post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.

                                                The day after the vaccine was received, the patient noticed arm and face swelling. She also experienced shooting pains and tingling in the same arm she received the vaccination. At work, it hurts when she carries things and has dropped items, which is unusual. Pain is mainly in the shoulder, but sometimes in the forearm. She has tried Tylenol, ice and naproxen with no relief. She received methylprednisolone on 4/12, and now feels that she is having an allergic reaction.  Complaints of increased wheezing, shortness of breath and swelling of her skin, she has used her albuterol inhaler at home which has provided no relief.   On 4/13 she received albuterol by nebulizer and an IV dose of methylprednisolone at the emergency department. She is going to start albuterol nebulizer at home, continue OTC antihistamine, discontinue the methyprednisolone and start prednisone tomorrow.

The leg symptom were present when seen 5 days ago, though were not discussed as Patient wasnt sure if thats what was really starting.

Also notes that different extremities feel different - left is worse than right. Seen 5 days ago, and noted to have been advised by hematology to stop eliquis approximately 2 weeks prior to onset of symptom after PE/Renal artery embolism 1/2021.  At that visit was referred to ER, where workup for repeat clot was normal (CTA, b/l upper extremities dopplers, head/neck CT, CXR).  EKG was notable for Sinus tach and nonspecific T wave abnormalities.  Discharged home with close follow up. Since then the intensity of the symptom as worsened and the leg symptoms have gotten more pronounced and consistent with the upper extremities symptom.

I went to my doctor and they suspected I could have appendicitis and also symptoms from the vaccine. They suggested going to the ER after 3 days if systems persisted. I went home after the doctor visit and was nauseous. I had sprite, ate white rice and chicken broth. My abdomen felt a bit better but I had a bad headache. 5/8/21 - Saturday I awoke at 6am with stabbing/burning chest pain that increased as time progressed. The chest pain was increasing and getting worse after 1 hour and 30 minutes. The pain was in the middle of my chest. My mom took me to the Emergency Room.

A 18-years-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9264), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 06Feb2021 12:45 (at the time of 18-years-old) as second dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included partial aortic bicuspid valve, aortic dialation, sulfa wellbutrin allergies (known allergies) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. No other vaccine administered in four weeks. The patient had not covid prior vaccination. The patient had not tested positive for covid post vaccination. Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol/ferrous fumarate/norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE) for an unspecified indication, from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously took bnt162b2 (Pfizer, Lot no EL8982,Administration time=12:15 PM,Vaccine location Left arm, Dose no 1) on 16Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. She received the vaccine at 12:50 PM and my temperature was 98.6 with no symptoms. At 1 am, her temperature went up to 99.6° and a headache, muscle aches and slight chills started. At 4:20 AM, woke up with a 101.6 fever, extreme nausea, dehydration and shakiness. In the morning at 9:00 AM temperature was 100.3 and when I got up around 12:00 PM, was extremely fatigued, dizzy when standing, and slightly nauseous which made it hard to eat normal foods. At 1:20 PM, temperature was 100.7. At 7:00 PM, nausea subsided slightly and was able to eat normal foods. At 10:00 PM, cold chills began in and at 11:00 PM, temperature was 100.4. The next day (08Feb2021), my temperature was at 97.8 upon awakening and felt dizzy, tired and winded with regular activities throughout the days but no fever. By the next day (09Feb), patient was completely syptom free. Arm pain was very minimal, pain level 1, on the day of vaccination and the day after and gone after that. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101.6 (at 4:20 patient temperature was 101.6), 100.3 (at 9 temperature of patient was 100.3), 100.7 (at 13:20 patient temperature was 100.7), 100.4 (at 23:00 patient temperature was 100.4), 99.6 (at 13:00 patient temperature was 99.6F) on 07Feb2021, and 97.8 (patient temperature was 97.8) on 08Feb2021. The patient not received treatment for events. The outcome of events recovered on Feb2021.

The second dose was reportedly worse. The fever ranged from 104.8 degrees Fahrenheit as a high and 102 degrees Fahrenheit being low, which receded after 3 days of care. In addition, chest pains and heart pain started at 8:00pm the day of the vaccination which was completed at 11:15am. Pain at the injection site and overall body muscle aches lasted for 3 days.   The heart/chest pains have yet to recede. Instead it is occurring more frequently in ?bursts? of pain with a constant aching sensation.

A 18-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0150; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 07Apr2021 13:30, as 1st dose, single dose and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0171; Expiration Date: was not reported ) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 28Apr2021 12:30, as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included colitis ulcerative from 2015 and ongoing. Additional Information for Other Conditions: states was in remission for 6 years prior to her second dose of the vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that she had a pretty severe reaction to her second dose of BNT162B2. States she has been in the hospital for 5 days last week and has now been in the hospital for 4 days this week because of side effects from vaccine that she received on 28Apr2021 which was her second dose. She thought the side effects would go away after the first hospitalization but was readmitted. First admitted to the hospital on 01May2021 for severe reaction to the shot for 5 days then was sent home because they thought the side effects would go away but the side effects have still been heavy. She was admitted again on Friday (14May2021) to the hospital from the side effects that are continuing. States she had lost 14 pounds from the time she was home from her first visit to the hospital. Patient vomiting a lot and couldnt hold food and water down: States that right after she got the second shot a couple of hours later she vomited a lot and couldn&#39;t hold food or water down which started 28Apr2021 and that she hasn&#39;t thrown up since Friday 14May2021, but has improved. She was starting to recover from it, it was just starting to get better. The really bad diarrhea started on the 28Apr2021 and was ongoing. The doctor thinks the second dose of the vaccine caused an ulcerative colitis flare up. She noticed the tachycardia on 29Apr2021. States her resting heart rate before the vaccine was 55 on average and now her resting rate was 105-115, and when she gets up to walk around it was 140-160. States that this was what was preventing her to be able to leave the hospital now. Tachycardia was the reason for admission for the first hospitalization. she was at urgent care she was tachycardic and her throat and glands were all swollen and they thought she needed to be admitted to the hospital. Swollen glands recovered last week, either 12 or 13May2021 and was completely recovered from that. Clarifies throat and swollen glands recovered 13May2021. Her dates of admission were 01May2021- 04May2021 for tachycardia. States she was currently at hospital and was admitted 14May2021 and was still there today for tachycardia and weight loss. States the tachycardia warranted both hospital admissions but the weight loss also contributed to the second admission as well. States her current weight was 116 after losing 14 pounds. She was weighed on the 4th when discharged from her first hospital admission and she weighed 130 pounds or 59 kilograms then had a follow up appointment with her cardiologist on the 14th for tachycardia and was weighed then and was 116 pounds at that time. They then sent her to the emergency room right after that follow up appointment to be admitted. States she hasn&#39;t been weighed again during this hospital admission so she thinks her weight was the same. She coughed and said sorry something got stuck in her throat, then continued her conversation. Ulcerative Colitis flare up- states she was unsure of when it transitioned from diarrhea to this flare up of ulcerative colitis. States she has just starting getting steroids and they increased her normal medications for her condition and was starting to improve. States she has a picture of her vaccine card and the events started after her 2nd dose. They did a procedure to confirm it was flare up at around 15:00 on 17May2021, performed a sigmoidoscopy and just found her left colon and rectum were inflamed as results which was similar to the ulcerative colitis flare up. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included heart rate: 55, heart rate: 105-115, heart rate: 140-160 on an unspecified date, sigmoidoscopy: found her left colon and rectum were inflamed as r on 17May2021. The outcome of the ulcerative colitis flare up was recovering, for event tachycardia, diarrhea and on 29Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered , lost 14 pounds was not recovered, and for vomiting a lot and couldnt hold food and water down was unknown and for events throat and glands swollen was recovered on 13May2021.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

No AE following prior vaccinations. The patient got the second dose yesterday (reported on 12Jan2021) around noon and she was experiencing not so great side effects. The biggest thing was headaches that were pretty debilitating. She was experiencing confusion and muscle aches all over. Stated that all the side effects started around the same time around 9 pm last night. The patient reported that her fever was down a bit so she was a little bit more coherent. Fever was slightly improved at 101.5. The patient took a few medicines for ADHD or anxiety and was wondering if they could have interacted with the vaccine. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. The patient reported her headache with medication was slightly better, but consistently the same. Treatment for headache inclued Ibuprofen. Outcome of event headache and fever was recovering, of event muscle aches all over was not recovered, of event confusion was unknown.

Slept 1.5 days, out of breath walking to bathroom from bed. Treated with sleep and sips of water, soup.  However, her mild daily migraine became more severe 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, her vision has worsened, and her eyes spontaneously dilated with pounding headache a few days ago along with nausea. It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

                                                Got second dose of vaccine the morning of March 10th.  Had the &#34;expected&#34; symptoms of fatigue, headache, and chills the evening of March 10th. Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

The next day, I woke up around 10:30am and was sore until about 12pm when I began to feel completely awful. I was tired and no pain reliever helped with the muscle aches in my shoulders and back. I felt like my chest was being weighed down and it felt like a horrible chore to even breathe. About 24 hours after the shot, under my jaws began to hurt terribly and ice didn&#39;t do much to help it. I finally fell asleep on 04/28 around 2am and woke up on 04/29 without any pain.

                                                About 10 hours after my second dose, I began to have muscle pain. The muscle pain is different than body aches that I?ve gotten with a cold. My muscles hurt and my skin is sensitive to the touch. It feels like the pain goes from the skin to the bone. I don?t know how else to describe it other than  feeling like a bad a sinus infection inside of my muscles. I know that?s a weird way to describe it but the pain is kind of indescribable and unique. The pain is worst in my neck and back. My joints also feel inflamed, it?s hard to close my hands into a fist. I spent most of the night freezing cold and shivering (I live without air conditioning).  It has been  about 35 hours since I received the vaccine. Cold and shivering has subsided but I have have the sweats for the past 8 or so hours. A bit of nausea and stomach pain started about 15 hours after the vaccine.

Injection site soreness began immediately after the vaccine, but is normal for me. Everything else began at time listed on this form (1/25/2021 afternoon) and ended by the following morning. I took one Tylenol to help with the chills and pain about 5 hours after symptoms started and it seemed to help a little.

A 20-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown ), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 at 10:30 AM (at the age of 20-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included allergy to eggs. Historical vaccination included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown ), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 10:30 AM (at the age of 20-years-old) in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The vaccine was administered in a hospital. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The reporter explained that the patient&#39;s adverse events &#34;started as expected&#34; with a  headache side effect (date not specified), however two days after the vaccine, while working as an EMT the patient became very dizzy and had to stop work. She remained dizzy, like vertigo, the next day but attempted to go to work. Her co-worker could see she wasn&#39;t right and took her to the hospital. The patient spent two days in the hospital, barely able to stand, getting a head MRI with contrast, evaluated for vertigo, blood tests, and they did not find anything and gave her vertigo medicine and sent her home. She has since had shifting symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, irregular heartbeat, severe upper back and neck pain. She has barely been able to move for several weeks and has seen an ENT doctor, another emergency doctor, and her regular doctor. None have found any other cause and have tried treating her with steroids. The events were treated with Meklazine and unspecified steroids. Lab data included SARS-CoV-2 test COVID 19 testing on 28Jan2021 which was negative. The clinical outcomes of headache, dizziness, vertigo, difficulty standing, swollen glands, irregular heart rate, back pain, neck pain and unable to more for several weeks were reported as not recovered.  The patient was tested for COIVD-19 after the vaccination, on 28Jan2021, and was found to be negative.

The &#39;blister&#39; is on my right hand index finger (measured 9 mm by 7 mm at its widest points, has not changed size or character since appearing) with a fainter in color &#39;blister&#39; (5 mm by 3 mm at widest) present on my right hand pinkie. No &#39;trauma&#39; to the site. Nonblanching, two petechiae present within the ring finger&#39;s blister, two also present in the one on my pinky. Those petechiae have disappeared in the last two days, but the spots are still present. Red, not warm, sensitive to touch. I had no other symptoms from dose one of the vaccination, outside of a sore arm and some joint pain. Possibly fatigue, but that&#39;s likely just me being fatigued as per usual.

                                                Full body aches starting the day after i received the vaccine. The next day the body soreness was severe enough to where it was painful to clench my fist or walk even a small distance. I also experienced nausea, loss of appetite, migraines and light sensitivity, and was unable to do normal tasks around the house for about 3-4 days. The full body soreness was the most debilitating symptom and certain aresa like elbows, knees, wrists and hips were painful to the touch. I think my joints were most affected. The soreness and pain can be compared to a flu but it was more intense than anything i have experienced before.

Pain was worse every time I inhaled. My breast on the right side swelled up and became red splotchy and hot. Had fever symptoms for 2 to 3 days afterwards. The excruciating pain in my chest and rib cage subsided within 6 to 8 hours. However the swelling in my right breast and redness did not subside for about three days.

On 1/17/21 reports she continued to have left axilla pain and the pain was worse. On 1/18 &amp; 1/19 she continued to experience pain in the left axilla and now in the left arm. The injection site was normal. On 1/20 the pain continued (able to work) and now she had redness and swelling at the injection site. The perimeter of the injection site had plum size redness with some mild to moderate swelling and warm to touch. I instructed to call her PCP that she may be experiencing a localized rxn., to the COVID vaccine. has no other sx.  notified her PCP and has a 3pm, scheduled ZOOM call today.

However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 8:30 AM, I went to use the restroom and felt dizzy with hot flashes. Immediately afterwards, I noticed that I had fainted and my mother helped me to my bed. After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

After waking up again later (around 12:30 pm), I took my temperature and found that I have a fever of 101°F.  I still have a fever and chills (2:50 pm).  I have not taken any medication to treat the fever yet and plan to just take it easy.  If I begin to feel worse, I might take an ibuprofen.  After getting the vaccine, my left shoulder was sore, and is still sore, but it?s my understanding that this is normal, and just as my arm was sore with the first vaccine, it may be 2 days before my arm feels better.  I am not concerned about the soreness of my arm.

                                                I got the shot around 5:20. About 4 hours later I started to feel nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. About an hour after that I had diarrhea. I went to bed, couldn?t fall asleep until 3. I woke up at 6 am sweating a lot and having body aches that were very persistent and painful in my legs. This persisted to 3/12/2021 until about 6 or 7 pm and I began to feel a lot better. That entire day I was hot and cold and had body aches. But no longer had vomiting. Then on Saturday, 3/13/2021 I woke up with a sore left armpit and neck but the armpit was way worse. I looked it up ?sore left armpit after covid vaccine? and it said swollen lymph nodes - so I?m guessing that?s what both pains were as my roommate who had the second dosage of Pfizer vaccine  the week before had a protruding lymph node on her neck. They both are still in pain until today 3/15/2021.

I became nauseous, sick and had seizure like episode and then I had tingling sensation in my face and limbs. They gave me shot epi-pen - two doses. I was pretty much paralyzed for hands and legs. I was brought to hospital and they treated me there for about a week and I had muscle weakness. I gained feeling back in my hands but not in my feet. I was at Haywood for a week. Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

Not exactly painful, but aching and deeply affecting. Almost itchy like all my muscles needed to stretch but they were also exhausted. All nerves in my body were highly activated, including my taste buds. Could not taste because I could taste everything and the food ended up feeling like individual particles rather than a cohesive flavor. Some nasal congestion. Overall, felt like being sick, but worse. Exhaustion Soreness in left arm

                                                I received my shot at 11:47 and started to lose sensation in my hands in the waiting area. After about 25 minutes I felt dizzy and was about to stand up but my muscles started shaking. My heart rate was checked and found to be 140. This lasted for about another 30 minutes. My heart rate went down and I was taken to a private area and checked out by EMS they gave me water and concluded it was some sort of panic attack. However, these are the same symptoms I have whenever I am allergic to a medication, NSAIDS, dicyclomine, etc. It always starts with ascending numbness from my fingers to the rest of my body. Then I start to shake and my heart rate goes way up. Usually I start to cough then vomit and my airway closes. Thankfully this time we were able to slow the process and I never experienced some of the last symptoms.

                                                Sore arm at injection spot that started at 3:00pm on 3/25/2021 and I took Tylenol. Fatigue started at 4:00pm on 3/25/2021. Developed slight cough at 9:00pm. I took Benadryl to help sleep through the night in case of any other side effects. Cough went away overnight, but my arm remained sore. I took Tylenol again on 3/26/2021 at 6:30am. At 7:00pm the same day, my left armpit began to feel sore which could not have been caused by anything other than vaccine as I haven?t been doing any physical activity. This worsened the next day, but I have not taken any Tylenol to alleviate it at this point.

I went to sleep for the rest of the day. 24 hours from the time of the injection, I still had a headache, so I went back to sleep. Eventually, at 48 hours after the injection, the headache, muscle soreness, and fatigue no longer lingered.

I felt tired, feverish, and pain at the injection site. The next day all of these symptoms became worse and I had joint pain. The third day I had bad headaches and fever all day. The metallic taste remains constant and I can&#39;t taste &#34;sweet&#34; accurately. Most sweet things taste tart and extremly sour.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after injection (injection at 5pm on 4/21), the first symptoms came on suddenly and lasted for about 7 hours (3am-10am on 4/22). These symptoms included severe nausea, headache, weak/rapid heart rate, chills, muscle aches, and a fever of 101 degrees F.  Lymph nodes in the left armpit were also swollen and painful to the touch. After 10am, the chills and fever subsided, but the headache, general muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and bouts of nausea persisted (these lasted the entire day). The following day (4/23),  nausea and muscle aches subsided but the headache remained. The headache only came on whenever changing elevation of the head (standing up, sitting down, bending over), at which point it would be painful for a few minutes after moving. An extremely stiff, painful neck also began the same day (4/23) and persisted for approximately 2 days after injection (accompanied by the headache). Lymph nodes under the collar bone on the left side of the body also became swollen (4/23). Lymph nodes in armpit and under collarbone are still swollen 6 days after injection, although not painful.

                                                4 days after first shot, she called me complaining of bad back pain. She was going to her family doctor the next day for her 21 yr old well visit and was going to get it checked out then. She had a complete physical and was cleared even her lungs were clear and she was good. Tuesday night April 13th at  10pm, she told me she had &#34;air bubbles&#34; in her chest. I said you mean indigestion, take tums I said. She said not mom, actual air bubbles and they are popping in my chest. I said you just got your physical, you are fine. They Thursday night April 15th she started having difficulty breathing and was out of breath. She went to urgent care on April 16th because she felt awful and they saw in an X-ray that she had a &#34;cyst&#34; in her upper right part of her lung and her lung was about to collapse. Sent her home on bed rest with a stereos and 2 inhalers. We got her Friday night from college because the pain in her back and now her chest was worse. Took her to ER and she had a collared lung and pneuomothroax. She was admitted to the hospital and they tried to see if the lung would heal itself.  It did not. They had to do surgery to repair the hole. When they were in there they saw a cobblestone texture where the hole was an they removed that texture and repaired the hole. She has never had a lung issue. Ever. She is also the 3rd person in my family to have had an adverse reaction to the shot. 6 of us vaccinated and 3 with injuries.

I took my temperature around 1 pm today and had a fever of 100.8. Throughout today, my headache has gotten progressively worse. The pain is sharp at the base of my head and radiates down my spine. I cannot put my chin to my chest without excruciating pain. I have had migraines before and this does not feel the same. This headache is more localized in the back of my head and spine. I also have had COVID19 before at the beginning of July 2020 from which the only symptom I had was a loss of smell which returned 2 weeks after my positive COVID test.

A 22-year-old female patient started to receive BNT162B2 (lot number: EJ1685; expiry date unknown) intramuscular (right arm), on 28Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 vaccine injection/ vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. This nurse was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 28Dec2020, in the morning. Her first concern was that the nurse put the COVID-19 Vaccine injection really low into her right arm, but believes it did go into the muscle. She was concerned that it did not really go into her muscle but the more she has been lifting her arm and seeing where the shot was administered and where her muscle in her arm ends she believes it did go into the muscle. She contacted her primary care provider today because about 30 minutes to 1 hour after she was administered the COVID-19 vaccine injection on 28Dec2020 she had a pain in between her right scapula and spine, which is the side she got her vaccine on. She also reported that her right arm does not hurt at all, she has no pain at injection site for COVID-19 Vaccine which she finds really weird. She also felt the pain if she hunches her shoulders backwards, sits up really straight, crosses her arms or hunches forward; she does not really feel it if she takes a deep breath. She was wondering if these events are normal or expected or serious. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                On 12/30/2020 I received my 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine. Felt fine, no symptoms or side effects until 12/31/2020 I did get hives on my arm site where I received the vaccine and those hives then started to spread throughout my body. I started having hives and rashes all over for a total of 6 days . Itching, swelling on my ears, arm, wrist, hands, back etc... took Benadryl for the 6 days and it helped for the 1st 2 days of my adverse event after that the Benadryl did nothing. Me and my PCP has agreed it was a possible delayed allergic reaction to the vaccine.

Took ibuprofen in the middle of the first night and it helped a little. Fatigue and some reasonable arm pain and neck stiffness continued for a while. Migraine has continued since the vaccination; it&#39;s been 5 days. I&#39;ve had to take at least 2 Advil every day to help it. Can&#39;t even complete an aerobic workout even with the Advil because my head is shaking so much. I&#39;ve had mild migraines before surrounding my period, but they always disappear when I sleep and aren&#39;t there first thing in the morning like this has been. I feel so bad, I find myself having to keep stop walking during the day when completing a task just to hold my pounding head.  Not sure what to do.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

This non-pregnant 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EN5318) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Feb2021 at 09:45 (at the age of 22-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included depression and anxiety, both from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no allergies to medication, food or other products, and did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included duloxetine from an unknown date for an unknown indication; ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (LARIN FE) from an unknown date for an unknown indication; ibuprofen from an unknown date for an unknown indication; and acetaminophen from an unknown date for an unknown indication. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported, it first started as a headache and extreme fatigue about two hours after the vaccine. She took two ibuprofen and felt better for a few hours, but the fatigue kept growing and then she started to get cold sweats and chills. The day after was the worse. She had fever, nausea, extreme muscle pain and fatigue, pain at the injection site, and congestion. She took acetaminophen through-out the day and couldn&#39;t eat much. The second day the fever and cold sweats went away but she still had intense nausea. It was the third day (as of 10Feb2021) and she felt better but still had fatigue and minor nausea. The events were reported as non-serious and did not require hospitalization. The clinical outcomes of headache, extreme fatigue, cold sweat, chills, fever, nausea, extreme muscle pain, congestion, couldn&#39;t eat much and pain at the injection site were reported as recovering. It was also reported that since vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

I then became nauseous, had a high fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and suffered from a migraine in the front sinus cavity all night. The next morning of the 27th my symptoms persisted, now accompanied by body aches, specifically my hip flexers were very sore and I was exhausted all day. by the morning of the 28th all symptoms subsided.

                                                I first noticed a pain in my left armpit on Sunday 04/04/2021, but I just thought I pulled a muscle or something. Then on Monday, it wasn&#39;t any better, and when I looked in the mirror I realized my lymph node was very swollen and tender. This brings me to today where the lymph node in my left armpit is still swollen. I talked to a nurse to be safe, and she told me it should go away within a week-10 days, so I&#39;m not too concerned.

A 22-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: ER8737) via an unspecified route of administration at arm left on 30Mar2021 16:45 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included vitamin d nos (VITAMIN D NOS). On 31Mar2021 The patient experienced and had fatigue and chills the following day after she got vaccine and took ibuprofen for the pain in my back &amp; arm and when stared to rest she felt pressure when opening &amp; closing them and looked in the mirror &amp; saw her bottom right eye orbit was swollen and was conserved if she was having a reaction to the vaccine and called a nurse &amp; tell a doc. They advised me to do cold compressions &amp; take benadryl. Therapeutic measures were taken. The outcome of the events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal association between the event bottom right eye orbit was swollen and the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded based on strong temporal association.

                                                Around 3:30am on Sunday, I woke up due to feeling very cold. My teeth were chattering and regardless of the amount of layers of clothes or blankets added, I could not get warm. Later in the day I checked my temperature and it registered at 100.6 degree Fahrenheit, but I did not feel as cold as I had earlier that morning. I also had what felt like a sinus headache and my whole body felt stiff/achy. There was also some slight nausea that occurred. The nausea and slight fever went away by 11am, but the headache and body aches lasted until about 9PM Sunday night. After my nausea went away I was able to take some Aleve to help with the stiffness.  At the site of injection, it is slightly raised red bump (about two inches across horizontally and vertically), and there is some slight pain  in the armpit area on this side as well. The swelling of the bump was slightly bigger yesterday, but the swelling has gone down some this morning.

When I woke up the next morning my whole body hurt so bad I could barely move. Over the next few days I felt better in some ways but my joints and muscles still hurt and they never have before. I am still feeling aches . I did not go see anyone as I do not have insurance.

                                                On April 5th, 2021 I went to the E.D. , for shortness of breath and severe right shoulder pain. While there they got a chest x-ray, ran labs, and did a chest CT. The CT revealed that I had one blood clot in my left lung and two blood clots in my right lung, as well as slight pleural effusion in the right lower lobe. They put me on Xarelto for the next 3-6 months and monthly follow up visits with my primary care provider. I was also given Hydrocodone as need. I experienced extreme pain with breathing and sort of movement for a week and half but currently only have occasional shoulder and back pain usually at the end of the day.

                                                I woke up with a high fever of 102 about 13 hours after my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. This developed into nausea, headache, dizziness, and muscular weakness/soreness for about 20 hours after. I still have some muscle soreness, and I have recently developed some minor digestive issues.

A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 21Apr2021 (at the time of 22-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included chronic migraines. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took acetylsalicylic acid/caffeine/paracetamol (EXCEDRIN) for chronic migraines. On an unspecified date it was reported that patient had the first dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine yesterday, 21Apr2021. She has underlying health issues. She was feeling antsy which only started today. it was not like her heart was racing or beating really hard, just she cannot relax even though she was tired. She has chronic migraines and took Excedrin earlier. It was also reported that maybe the ingredients of the vaccine do not coincide with the caffeine in the Excedrin. She has muscle and joint pain bad today, but her arm was fine. Tiredness and headache very much so. The headache was worse today. She took fiorinal with codeine for the bad headache because the RPh (registered pharmacist) said it was ok. she read side effects and asked the agent if agent was saying that feeling antsy is not a side effect of the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

As the day went on, I got muscle aches and pains all through my body (especially in my left arm - the injection site - of course) and fatigue. It continually worsened throughout the afternoon and evening, despite bedrest and proper hydration, and I could barely sleep.  However, the next morning I woke up just as I did the day before - no problems, feeling fine.

                                                Started experiencing dizziness on the day of the second dose (4/30/21). Dizziness continued for 2 weeks and then stopped for a week and came back and have been experiencing it for almost 2 months now. Have gone to 7 doctor visits including an opthemologist, the emergency room twice and my primary care physician and a walk in clinic. I have been prescribed servers medications which do not alleviate the symptoms including meclazine, hydroxaline, scopolamine, amoxicillin, prednisone, Valium, and reglin (for headache). About 3 weeks after getting the second dose I began experiencing headaches so I went for a CT scan in the ER on 5/24 which came back normal. I returned to the ER on 2/27 with blurry vision and was sent for an MRI on my brain and neck which also came back normal. I have upcoming appointments with a neurologist and an ENT next month. I have also been experiencing muscle aches for the past 3 days specifically in my joints, my arms, and legs. I have also had headaches that feel like my head it being sliced or stabbed on the right side.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction.

On 01/08  ~5 PM I began to develop  a fever that reached a peak of 102.4 at 4am (01/09), despite taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours. Last fever recorded 01/09 ~9PM of 99.5 (while still taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours).

                                                Around 9pm, I started getting the chills and some body aches. Body aches were worse in my hands, neck and lower back. By 10pm I felt extremely exhausted, continuing with body aches and chills. Around 12am I had a fever of 102.6 and extreme 10 out of 10 lower back pain. I have never felt more sick in my life. The back pain was so severe I thought I was having a kidney stone. I was ready to go to the hospital. The fever lasted until  about 4am when I took some ibuprofen. I felt tired and had mild body aches until 3pm the  following day.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

                                                First 2 days after vaccination, I had some injection site pain that was improving. Day 5 after vaccination, I developed lymphadenopathy on my left side with swelling into the chest area developing on day 6. Day 8 after vaccination, my injection site turned red and itchy and I began to have trouble breathing. I went to urgent care.  I saw P. A. She said that it was more likely that the difficulty breathing would be due to my asthma, but she could not recommend whether or not I should receive my second dose. She proscribed 20mg of Prednisone and refilled my albuterol prescription. About 20 hours later, my breathing is still difficult and my arm still itches.  We also discussed that the respiratory symptoms could be caused or exasperated by COVID-19, so I am waiting on results from a covid test.

I experienced this throughout the night and this made sleeping difficult. The next morning, I took 2 500-mg tablets of acetaminophen. This relieved my pain for several hours. At about 1 pm, I became very fatigued. I slept the whole afternoon, ate dinner, took 2 more 500-mg tablets of acetaminophen, and slept for 11 hours.

I knew it was a side effect from the vaccine for I had been experiencing severe chills, fever, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and nausea the day before (2/9/2021) and those symptoms except for the fever had subsided on the 10th. I had been unable to eat all day on the 10th due to the pain but it was manageable. At 2pm the abdominal pain got worse. At 4:30pm the pain became unmanageable and I could not walk erect without severe pain. I was crying and bend over trying to walk. I had a family member drive me to the ER and arrived at around 4:40pm.  Lying down with my knees up seemed to help the pain a bit but was exacerbated when lying flat or ambulating. I was given Pepcid, zofran,  and toradol all IV push  at 8pm and the pain subsided within 15 minutes. Today I still have mild abdominal pain but I would rate it at a 1/10.

                                                A few hours after  receiving my second dose of the COVID vaccine, I was extremely fatigued. I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

                                                The first day I got my vaccine, I felt  fine, but my arm with the injection sight was very sore and body slightly achy. The second day I woke up and my arm was sore, but other than that I felt normal. Around 4pm on the second day, my back started to hurt where the break break in my spine is. It was just a normal amount of pain at first, but within an hour there was throbbing pain in my lower back, spreading into my legs. This is where I normally feel my chronic pain, but I had a spinal injection a little over 6 months ago and doesn&#39;t usually stop working until about a year. It is the normal pain I experience in the normal places, but the pain is worse and out of no where. That is not usually how the pain comes on when the spinal block wears off. It is much more gradual. It could be a coincidence, but the pain is not the way I have ever experienced the pain.  My back hurts too much to do things I need to do to function, which only happens to me when I have done something with a lot of physical activity that puts tension on my back like jumping, dancing, roller coasters. Before I started experiencing this pain, it was just a normal day for me where I didn&#39;t exert my back any more than normal, which is very little.

Took 2 ibuprofens which helped the fever, but still had trouble sleeping. Later in the morning 8am, had same symptoms plus had 3 different sudden episodes of dizziness,  nausea, and light headedness. I had to physically sit down as it felt like I might pass out. From 9am-1pm the symptoms steadily decreased until there was just a bit of muscle weakness. I was taking ibuprofen every 6hrs.

This was presumably because I also have a needle phobia but I did almost faint and had to have on site EMT asses condition and observe for 30 minutes. At 4 pm one hour after injection face felt itchy and irritated and noticed hives on neck and jawline. Immediately administered benadryl 50 mg which made the hives subside.

                                                The second the person gave me the shot my index finger went numb, stiff and my range of motion decreased.  Within less than 24 hours day my whole hand and lower arm were stiff, numb,  painful, and tingling. I also have overall weakness and doing basic tasks like writing essays for school has become painful and difficult. My hand is stiff and looks like a claw. While it has gotten a little better after taking medications that my doctor prescribed my fingers are still weak stiff, numb, tingling, and painful.  The vaccine was administered too far up and too far to the left which has most likely caused nerve damage.  There is also a small bruise at the injection site and the injection is still visible 5&#43; days later. This could have been prevented through better training of health officials working at state-run vaccine sites. I hope this hasn&#39;t caused lasting damage.

                                                Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; Pain in arm; Joint pain; This is a solicited report from a contactable consumer (patient), via a non-Pfizer marketing program.  A 23-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscularly on an unspecified date as single dose for COVID-19 immunization and adalimumab (HUMIRA), subcutaneously from an unspecified date at unspecified dose for moderate to severe adult crohn&#39;s disease. Medical history included hemorrhage of colon from 2018 and moderate to severe adult crohn&#39;s disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, patient experienced postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, pain in arm and joint pain. The events were reported as serious, medically significant. The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. Outcome of event pain in arm was unknown while for all other events was recovered on an unspecified date. Causality assessment for the drug Humira and the events Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and Joint pain was reported as No reasonable possibility by the reporter and manufacturer while for the event Pain in arm was not reported by the reporter and No reasonable possibility by the manufacturer. Causality assessment for the drug BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) and the events postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, pain in arm and joint pain was not reported by the reporter.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of the vaccine BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be fully excluded based on the presumed temporal relationship and since it is part of the product safety profile. Underlying hemorrhage of colon and moderate to severe adult Crohn&#39;s disease may be contributory to the event orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Case will be  reassessed if additional information is received  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

They began on the side of the injection but spread to include both arms. In addition, two similarly swollen and painful lumps have appeared, though I am not sure if they are lymph nodes given their locations. One is along my the line of my waistband in the front of my body, not in the traditional groin area where most charts ascribe lymph nodes to be. One is directly below my areola on my right breast. Along with these lumps, I developed a rash made up of several small, inflamed hives that range from painless, to itchy, to painful. They are concentrated along my bra line, particularly around my breasts, but are spread everywhere from below my neckline to above my ankles. These symptoms began approximately 7 days after my second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and are continuing at the time of this report.

It felt like things were moving in slow motion, frame by frame, when I woke up at 3am. Was light headed, couldn&#39;t stand, chills and shaking. I vomited from 3-4 am and then again at 8am when I woke up, with my visual disturbances limited to the 3-4am hours. I took Advil and was able to go back to sleep for most of the day, sleeping from around 9am to 1pm. Nausea, fever, and vomiting have all have cleared. Now I just have a headache and muscle aches, especially near the injection site. Almost 24 hrs after my vaccine now and I feel drastically better than I did overnight.

                                                At about the same time the standard soreness at the shot site from the shot began to form (in the left arm), soreness also began to form in the left armpit.  Both signs of soreness began around 7pm the evening of the shot. The day after the shot was administered the soreness in the shot site began to lessen but the pain in the armpit persisted. The armpit pain, the day after the shot was administered, felt sore, almost as if I have been holding a golf ball tightly between my arm and torso for hours and a bruise had formed.  That night I checked my armpit to see if there was any swelling or bruising. There was some swelling and a small lump within the tissue of the armpit the night of the day after the shot. The morning of the 23rd , two days after the shot was administered, the armpit pain persisted and the lump was bigger than the night before and the swelling remained.

                                                My family has a strong history of arthritis. Mine has never been active, I?ve never been tested for it, I have never been diagnosed. But my grandma, mom, aunt and twin sister all have it.  I woke up on Wednesday the 28th with a slightly swollen and stiff knee, not triggered by any activity or environmental factor. There has been no injury or stress on the joint. But it has swollen and appears to be experiencing an RA flare up.

The night of getting the first shot I barely slept because I had chills all night long &amp; my entire body was so sore it hurt to lay in any position. In the morning, I still had extreme muscle pain all over. I was extremely light headed &amp; dizzy, I had a throbbing headache so I  took 2 aleve pills. I was getting super nauseous and almost passed out while trying to get to my bathroom just in time to throw up only water. Just before throwing up my vision went fuzzy,  my ears were ringing, I was dripping sweat, it was getting hard to breathe, &amp; my hands were shaking.  After taking a cold shower, laying down, &amp; drinking some water I feel a bit better but not 100% normal.

                                                I woke up 6 days after receiving the vaccine and I had some pain at my collar bone. It felt bruised and I felt something that felt like a ball rolling around. I called advice from clinic and they scheduled me a visit with Dr. for a video visit. At my visit with him, I explained what it was and I mentioned that I heard about lymph node enlargement after the vaccine. He told me that he hadn&#39;t heard anything about that, but scheduled an ultrasound for me. I scheduled an appt with my PCP and she told me that she did hear about the lymph node enlargement from the vaccine. I had the ultrasound on 03/30 and the results came back benign. Dr. called with my results and requested a follow up in 3 months.

                                                I felt very fatigued starting around 6pm. Severe chills began around 9pm, followed by a fever. The fever went from 100.1 to 102.2 over the course of about an hour (11:30pm-12:30pm), at which time I took 400mg of ibuprofen. The fever was 102.1 thirty minutes after taking the ibuprofen. Along with the fever I experienced tachycardia, body and muscle aches, and moderate to severe deltoid pain at the injection site. I believe the fever broke around 3:00am. The fatigue and body aches lasted about 24 hours since they began, but the majority  of the rest of my symptoms were gone after the fever. The arm pain at injection site was noticeable and painful for about 72 hours before subsiding.

I woke up at 1am and started feeling a chest pain: both sharp pains and a dull throb. It continued when I woke up and has throughout the day.

Later that night, I had very strong rigors, chills, severe headache and felt feverish. I took some Tyenol and felt a little better. I woke up at 5 AM to go to work, and my body was so fatigued and tired I couldn&#39;t move. My hands were shaking badly, and my whole body hurt. My joints hurt, my muscles, ect. I called out of work, as I work in the Micro lab doing COVID-19 PCR testing, I couldn&#39;t pipet correctly if I was shaking. I do not have any pre-existing conditions, and I have no allergies. I have never experienced an adverse reaction to a vaccine.

It mainly shows up in my chest. Sharp and achey pains all in different spots at different times. This has been occurring now for 6 days and has not gotten better with time or any medicine I?ve been instructed to take by physician. Sometimes it throbs, sometimes it aches, sometimes it?s sharp and sudden. There is no consistency other than how painful it is. The pain has gotten more intense this evening 1/19/21. I have not experienced more than a half hour without any pain. It has been ongoing since 1/13/21. I woke up last night at 2:45am with a throbbing pain on the left side of my chest.

                                                The day after receiving my second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, I experienced minor side effects, including elevated temperature (99.8 F), headache, and soreness in my arm at the injection site. This lasted the whole day. The day after that, my temperature was back to normal (98.1 F), no headache, and the soreness had subsided significantly, but I am experiencing some swelling and soreness in my right armpit.

I took Tylenol again to lower the fever. When I woke up around 8:00am, the symptoms were gone except for lingering fatigue.

On Friday the 22nd, this patient awoke with worsening chills and sudden nausea. She took her temperature, which was 100.5. This patient called employee health and asked if symptoms lasting  over 48 hours were ordinary or if she should be tested for COVID-19.

                                                I felt a little fatigued all day after the shot, but nothing more. As soon as 10pm (02/01/2021) came around I had a pounding headache. The most intense headache of my life. I also got an intense stomachache and it felt like I had an ulcer. That progressed to a low grade fever, chills, myalgia, and arthralgia. The myalgia and arthralgia were so intense that moving to stretch my legs was incredibly painful. I was also very nauseous. The intensity of the arthralgia and myalgia subsided around 8am on 02/01/2021. All my other symptoms continued until around 11am on 2/2/2021. I still have a headache and some muscle pain, but they are manageable.

Next morning 1/28 very sore leg muscles, hot flashes, headache. As day went on my limbs were tingling and had some numbness.  Increasingly getting fatigue and wasn&#39;t able to keep my head up for more than 30sec with out it falling. By 5p I could not move left arm at all and called PCP office and went to ER. Over 5 hours I got  feeling back in left arm and left ER at 10:30p. CT was done to rule out stroke or other injury. Next day around 2p my right arm started to get more numb and I wasn&#39;t able to move it much. SOB and throat tightening came back briefly. Later that day lumbar puncture done to rule out guillain barre syndrome. Numbness is not as severe now 2/3 and each day since 1/28 it gets increasingly less

I woke up with a slight fever that lasted two days (highest point being 102.5*F, but it ebbed and flowed throughout the period). I had nausea (threw up twice, was able to keep food down by the evening of the first day after getting the vaccine). I had chills as well, and standard body aches and headaches that often accompany fevers and chills. My arm was also sore at the injection site, as with most vaccines, but it was actually bizarrely most sore at my armpit, not at the injection site.

A 24-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3247), intramuscular in left arm on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included generalised anxiety and allergies: Sulfa sensitive. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 22Jan2021, 45-60 minutes after vaccination, patient experienced hallucination, severe confusion, dizziness/light headedness, disorientation, fatigue, tachycardia, anxiety, full body weakness, then on 22Jan2021, 8 hours after, patient had full body muscle aches, headache, chills, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, anxiety, tachycardia, 16 hours after, experienced  confusion, full body muscle aches, headache, chills, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, tachycardia, anxiety, then 48 hours after, had confusion, full body muscle aches (TYLENOL helped), headache, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, tachycardia, anxiety, then 1 week after vaccination, patient was experiencing confusion, anxiety, and hallucinations throughout the entire week.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID saliva test: negative on 27Jan2021 and negative on 10Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of full body muscle aches. No treatment was received for the other adverse events. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported event hallucination cannot be completely excluded given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association.

I tried to rest and take ibuprofen but nothing was helping the pain and I went to my health center a week after I received the vaccine and they said I was having too much of a localized inflammatory response and to alternate between ibuprofen and tylenol and use heat but the pain is still there and it&#39;s been almost 3 weeks.

                                                I got my Pfizer first dose today and it was fine at first, but four hours later I was slammed with incredible arm and shoulder pain. I have a really high pain tolerance (tore my meniscus 3x with no surgery or pain meds, wasn&#39;t too bad) and I&#39;m 24F, not on any medications. I keep reading that sore arms are common, but this is a 6/7 on the pain scale. Putting on joggers was excruciating and I almost vomited. I can&#39;t even bring a glass to my mouth with that arm. Even laying as still as possible hurts. I cannot lift my arm past my pelvis and my shoulder is immobile. I feel nauseous when I move it.  I haven&#39;t seen this experience anywhere so I am puzzled... I&#39;m fully vaccinated w/ everything else and the closest to this was the tetanus shot, which hurt but not like - this - level of pain. I&#39;m getting a bit concerned that the person who did it (in a hundred car drive thru) missed the deltoid and shot it into my shoulder?? It&#39;s VERY high on my arm. I believe in this vax 100% but I can&#39;t believe the pain I&#39;m having and why it&#39;s not mentioned anywhere.  Like I am so so grateful for this vax and am in awe of the science -- and everyone should get it   -- but I just don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m in literal excruciating pain :( Moving it even slightly feel like I&#39;m ripping it from the bone.   It?s now been 20 hours and the pain is worse than ever, even breathing, sneezing or bending over causes searing pain.

                                                My hair began to fall out a week after my second dose of the vaccine. It may be unrelated, but I wanted to report it just in case.  I had a fever from the night of 03/31/21 to 01/02/21 that was managed well with tylenol. I had hot flashes, chills, and joint pain during this time as well. Aside from my hair falling out, I feel completely fine now. As I said, the hair may be a coincidence as I have an unrelated autoimmune disease.

It&#39;s been almost two weeks since my second dose (March 30,2021). It&#39;s not a huge concern. It&#39;s tender and hurts a little.  No treatments at the moment. I haven&#39;t contacted my doctor yet. If it hasn&#39;t gone away in another 2 weeks or so then I will contact my Doctor.

My injection site has also been SUPER itchy since day 3, and it?s still warm to touch. I do not have a rash or any redness. I only had redness for about 2 days after the shot

Minimal pain until around 3 am, woke up with severe muscle pain that continued to worsen into the next day- 4/14/2021. I could barely move my arm, the pain had me in tears a few times. Accompanied by inflammation surrounding injection site. Used a cold pack on the area within the first 24 hours, it did not help nor did ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, or acetaminophen. Used a heating pad on low on the area to help with muscle stiffness, it helped minimally. Today, 4/15, the pain and inflammation is improved greatly but hives developed along with a very mild temperature. Symptoms improving overall

                                                4/4: Woke up Easter Sunday with the following symptoms: sweats, chills, uncontrollable shaking, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Went to Urgent Care, but it was closed for the holiday, so instead went to ER. See Item 19 for details. I was discharged within an hour because there was nothing seriously wrong with me, doctor wrote it off as a stomach bug and ordered me to rest and hydrate.  4/4 - 4/10: Virtually every day for this week went the exact same. I would wake up between 6-7am, feel nauseous, weak, no appetite, and shaking. Walking around my apartment would leave me utterly exhausted. I would nap from 9am-12pm, then again from 2-4pm. Ate very little, drank water and sports drinks when awake. Breathing was still shaky. Occasional diarrhea.  4/10: Although slightly less ill than the previous 6 days, I still felt weak, shaky, and exhausted. I went back to Urgent Care this time, and the doctor examined me. She noted my left ear was very inflamed and suspected an ear infection. She prescribed me a week of amoxycilin and told me to rest and eat bland foods.  4/12: After 2 days on the antibiotics, some of my symptoms cleared. I was no longer shaking or having shortness of breath, and although still tired, I did not sleep for half the day as I had the previous week. My appetite was not fully there yet, and in the mornings of this week I would wake up feeling nauseous for about 2 hours. On this day 4/12 my period also started, which is unusual. It was not due to start until around April 17th. My period is very regular and light due to being on birth control, so I consider this abnormal. The flow was also very heavy.   4/17: Heavy flow of my period slows significantly and is now just a slight pink/brown color. I only need a liner to contain it. This is also my last day of antibiotics, so I buy a probiotic supplement in the hopes that it will help settle my gut.  4/17-present (4/20): The morning nausea and lack of appetite are still present despite being off the antibiotics. Occasional discomfort in abdomen/chest. Unexplained muscle soreness in hips, legs, back, and chest. My bowel movement schedule has also completely changed. Normally I do not experience a bowel movement until late morning, after 10am. But for the past 2 weeks I have been woken up around 5:30am with a sudden urge. At the beginning of my illness it was diarrhea but now it has transitioned to slightly more solid feces. It is not really diarrhea anymore.

After extubation, I continued to have anaphylaxis at least once a day with no correlation to what I was eating or drinking. I also began having a severe auto immune flare up with body pains in my legs, back, and stomach immobilizing me with generalized weakness.

Exactly a week after getting the shot, I woke up with a fever of 101.2. The night before, I was experiencing lower right back pain, thinking it was a pulled muscle, but the pain was still present in the morning and it was painful. The rest of the day I had chills, fatigue, fever, lower back pain,  and no appetite. The next day I experienced the same things, plus headache. I was able to control my fever wit Mortin. The 3rd day I woke up with pain in intestine area  as well in my back. I had realized that I had not pooped for several days and I feel that I might have been constipated. I was feeling better on that third day,  with on and off fevers and fatigue. The 4th day I only experienced a fever and it went away throughout the day which was promising. 5th day I woke up feeling great and completely normal. So I experienced Flu like symptoms, plus back and muscles aches and constipation. I took 2 extra strength tylenol everyday along with 1 Motrin and sudafed Claritin D. I drank lots of water and hot teas. 4 days till i felt better.

                                                - 24 hours after felt typical, fatigue, achs, and nausea - 4 days after my second dose I got severe upper back pain for two weeks (no prior history of back pain ever)  - 10 days after my second dose I began to have severe acid reflux after anything and everything I ate. These symptoms have lasted for over seven weeks and are so bad to the point I cannot eat or sleep and have sought out emergency medical attention. In this same time period, I got what my doctors believe is Eosinophilic Esophagitis where my throat is now chronically inflamed, making it difficult to swallow. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue, anxiety, and mood swings when I never had a history of this.  I have tried taking several medications and PPI&#39;s with no success as well as trying every type of diet and lifestyle change possible with no success. I have not recovered from this and expect it will be some time before I do.

Two days later and it?s worse and it spread to my neck and other right shoulder blade. It?s so sharp and awful. It?s gotten worse. Today it?s awful and it spread to the ride side of my chest. Same type of pain. I feel like I can?t breathe in that well and my lungs burn.

                                                Suspected bursitis with prolonged arm pain and weakness 2 weeks after first Pfizer dose. On the day of vaccination, I had a panic attack and nearly blacked out after vaccination, something that had never happened to me after a vaccination. Once the pain started a few hours after vaccination, it significantly increased. I experienced excruciating pain in my left arm like I had never felt after any other vaccination. Complete inability to move my arm without pain; the pain persisted even with zero movement whatsoever. Within the first 12 hours the pain spread to my entire left shoulder, and within 24 hours the pain spread to my neck, and general upper left quadrant of my body to the point where inhaling deeply would cause chest pain on my left side. This extreme pain persisted for about 3-4 days. After about the 5th day, my left arm still felt different and weaker than my right arm but little pain remained. After the 7th day, pain started back up whenever I tried to use my arm in any way. The days went on and the pain and arm weakness is not passing. It is minor pains, aches, and occasional throbbing compared to those first few days after vaccination but chronic pain nonetheless. My left arm continues to feel weak and I have a concentrated area of pain directly where the vaccination site was, it&#39;s as if I could still feel exactly where the needle went through my body. My arm feels okay pain-wise upon waking most days but I am unable to do anything as simple as chopping vegetables or washing dishes without feeling pain for the rest of the day. I am unable to even wear a backpack for more than 10 minutes without my left shoulder hurting and feeling fatigued.

                                                Almost exactly 12 hours after receiving the second dose of COVID vaccine, I woke up from sleep curled into a ball, covered in sweat, absolutely freezing, teeth chattering, and all my muscles were shaking violently. I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) and a non-contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. After a few days on 25Dec2020, patient started to experience reactions, like a tingling reaction on her arms, body, and also swelling of the face, and she also started to have headaches. It has been like that for a while, and patient who is a health care professional was brought to the emergency room, to check on what was going on, but she was not able to get the medication they need, it was twice that the consumer he tried to bring the patient to emergency, and she still hasn&#39;t gotten medication for the symptoms. She started having reactions, she had numbness in the face and tingling,  headaches, tingling in the hands and arms, and weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness, she felt like fatigue and also in the back, she had pain and soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down. She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Intermittent fevers and headaches/head pressure that have continued for 6 days post vaccination.   Side effects of muscle aches/chills subsided after 48 hours. Fever was less than 100F after 48 hours, so I returned to work per protocol. Was taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen.    3rd day: afebrile but headache remained. Taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen to help manage.   4th day: intermittent fevers throughout day (no higher than 100.3F). headache continues.   5th day: afebrile in the morning, but as day progressed headache began to get worse and I eventually spiked a low grade fever as high as 101.5F that afternoon. I was excused from work per protocol and receiving care/evaluation from occupational heath and infectious disease for return to work purposes. Still taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen which were helping the fevers stay between 99F but not helping the headaches.   6th day: Taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen around the clock. Fevers have ranged from 98.9-100.8F so far. Headache still remains.

I have had no sudden stressful events/changed in diet/change in activity. Following the vaccine I had moderate lower back and right lower quadrant abdominal pain that I wrote off as maybe something I ate. This cramping pain did not cease and stayed at a severity of 4/10.  I did not take over the counters for relief. Upon wakening the the next day I found I had bled through my under garmets and had a severe headache. This went away as the day professed and I did not have any more break through bleeding since.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

                                                Within 30 -40 mins of administration of Pfizer EK9231 started developing slight numbness on right side of the face, mainly right cheek and under right eye. Took Ibuprofen 400mg still was feeling the numbness and took another Ibuprofen 200mg  around 1400 for the still felt slight numbness.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl around 1700 because I still was feeling the slight numbness on right side of face. In the morning was not noting any improvement in the facial numbness and was feeling that the cheek muscles were tighter on the right side and causing subtle facial asymmetry.  I got worried and went to the ED. I was assessed,  diagnosed with facial paresthesia.  I was offered an MRI, I declined as I did not feel that I needed it at the time. Provider prescribed 40 mg of prednisone daily for 5 days, valacyclovir 1000mg  3 times a day for 7 days. After starting prednisone facial muscle tightness I was feeling improved, still felt slight numbness more so in the mornings the next 2 days. I took the full course of prednisone, I am no longer feeling the facial symptoms. I stopped taking valacyclovir on day 3, since I felt that the prednisone was what is helping and it was harder to evenly take it 3 times a day.

However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

I could not lift my right arm, I was exhausted doing everyday things.  Sunday- migraine wouldn?t go away. I got body chills but it wasn?t until later at night. And my body aches became moderate.  Monday- my migraine went down to a headache but my body aches wouldn?t go away. I did not take any pills. Throughout the day. I was tired. It was hard moving around. I was kind of sluggish but not as much as Tuesday. Tuesday- severe body aches. Both my arms hurt but I thought it was just due to laying in bed after getting home from work at 2:30 on Monday. Severe pain in my shoulders and middle of my back. I did some stretches thinking maybe my body was just sore from laying down. Went to bed at 12 because I couldn?t keep warm and my back was killing me.  Wednesday- horrible ache though out my back I got up to move but it hurt so much. I?m walking so slow. I need to rest on the walls because it hurts so much to move. My headache is still there. I took midol at 1:30pm;  did not do much. I?ve been trying to move about and stretch but my body does not allow me. Even typing hurts I cannot keep a good grip on things. My arms, entire left side of my back and many thighs  are in pain

A 25-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 13Jan2021 at 08:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included anxiety. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) from 2018 and ongoing (for two-and-a-half years) for anxiety. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EK5730) on 22Dec2020 at 09:00 AM (in the right arm) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was calling to report side effects. After the second dose on 13Jan2021, the patient noticed around 18:00 that the muscles in her back became stiff and tight. It got worse overnight and, in the morning (14Jan2021), she had to walk bent over. This stiffness progressed to her whole body. That morning she also noticed her hands felt tingly (like when they fall asleep) and she had a migraine with vomiting and dizziness. All of these effects started to resolve but now her muscles are still very sore (Jan2021). The migraine went away this morning as did the vomiting and dizziness. The patient recovered from &#34;Hands felt tingly&#34;, &#34;Migraine&#34;, &#34;Vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Dizziness&#34; on 15Jan2021. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Muscles are still very sore&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Had to walk bent over&#34; was unknown. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, and low blood sugar. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had rash on her face, chest, and arms on 08Jan2021 (10 minutes after the vaccination), puking on 09Jan2021, she did have a fever during the vomiting in Jan2021, red knot on her arm in Jan2021, her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm in Jan2021, have a black bruise in Jan2021, a red dot/red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch in Jan2021. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 11Jan2021, of other remain events was unknown. Clinical course: She says after she got the shot on 08Jan2021  she developed a rash about 10 minutes after on her face, chest, arms, and they gave her a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) shot and monitored her for about half an hour-45 minutes and then they let her go home and told her husband to monitor her through the weekend. Then Saturday (09Jan2021) morning she began puking and she kept puking through Monday and she still has knot about a week and a half later, a red knot but other than that she feels better. She did have a fever during the vomiting and she did have a black bruise and a red dot in the middle. She says it was red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch and it went away by Friday and then it popped back up Saturday but she feels fine. It was weird that it went away and then a week after on Saturday it popped back up. She has a picture of it, it came back and her arm felt sunburnt all day feel but she feels fine. She has never had all this happen before. It was so weird the nurse was calling to check in Saturday morning and she was telling her at about noon she felt okay she felt better than she did when she had the rash but then she just started puking. The vomiting stopped Monday 11Jan2021. She called to try to get an appointment and they told her that some people are having that reaction, like people that have the rash are having that happen. Her mother in law is having her take a picture of her arm everyday and send it to her, she is just one of those people. It went away everything healed there was a big back bruise it went away and then Saturday all of sudden it came back and her arm was burning, she would say her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm. She says she did report her symptoms through Vsafe she is not sure if that is Pfizer or not. She went online and use the paper work they gave her to scan the thing. She does not have a reference number to provide from that she is not sure if that is through Pfizer. She was a pharmacy tech but she did not handle prescriptions in high school so she does not think that counts. She has never had a reaction, she had an allergic reaction to tick fever but everyone gets a rash from that she gets a rash from dryer sheets but she has never had any issues with medications or vaccines. She says she has the packet they gave her. She has the vaccine in her car, she is an auditor working from home so she can go get it out of the car. She was planning on getting a second shot but now she is not sure she is thinking maybe she shouldn&#39;t because they are saying a lot of people that have this reaction have an anaphylactic reaction the second time so she does not know if she will get it or not. She is told she is high risk so she was getting the shot because she is scared to get COVID she thinks she may would have to go in the hospital or something so she does as much as she can, staying away from people and always wearing a mask. They get groceries delivered and food delivered.

Intense muscle aches, worse two days after the vaccine, instead of just one day after. Aching of the muscles around the eyes (the ones you would use to squint and the top of the cheeks), the scalp, neck (the base of the skull and trapezius), biceps, aching around the wrist joints, hip flexors, quadriceps, and ankle joints. Found relief with 500 mg acetaminophen throughout the day.

By 2:00pm, had slurred speech; severe fatigue; red skin on hands, face, neck; balance problems and dizziness; swollen hands. That evening through the next morning, I was experienced severe flu-like symptoms, including vertigo, extremely severe fatigue, and full-body muscle aches. My temperature was slightly elevated (98.7) from my &#34;baseline,&#34; which is around 96.7. On Saturday, I was very tired, no appetite, still experiencing some vertigo and muscle aches. Symptoms improved overnight and by Sunday evening, I was mostly back to normal, with some lingering fatigue.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Monday, March 15th around 9:30/10:00am I began to feel nauseous, had a headache, felt cold and overall tired. I had to stop working and I laid down to rest and slept for 4-5 hrs. Continued to feel weak with a loss of appetite for the remainder of the day and slept through the night.  Tuesday, March 16th I began work around 8am and by 9:20am I had to stop due to a pounding headache and extreme nausea and muscle aches in my back. My eyes were sensitive to light, my head hurt and felt a lot of pressure in the front of my head and back of my neck and my  ears were beginning to hurt and ring. I took acetaminophen and slept for 3-4hrs. When I woke up the nausea had subsided but I still had a lingering headache, just not as terrible, and took additional acetaminophen 500mg. This headache continued for the rest of the day into the night, waking me up to the point of needing another 500mg acetaminophen and waking up the next morning Wednesday, March 17th with still a slight lingering headache, slight sensitivity to light, light nausea, light muscle/body ache, and general feeling of weakness.

                                                My daughter experienced immediate nerve pain at the site, L deltoid; followed by radiation to her fingers.  Then, she complained of extreme muscle pains, all over; itching and shortness of breath with formation of mucus in her chest.  She has interstitial lung disease and is well aware of what mucus-filling in her chest (lungs) feels like.  She also had headache and coughing and this necessitated using Benadryl 50mg, her Xopenex rescue inhaler at the site; followed by contacting of her pulmonologist for future treatment and instructions.

I recieved the injection in my right arm. It was a dull achey pain but upon palpation became a sharp shooting pain that radiated from my armpit into my back and under my ribcage. There was also swelling and it to hurt have my right arm resting along my side.  Today, on 4/2/21, I am still experiencing this pain, however, it is less severe. To treat, I have been taking 2 acetominaphen approximately every six hours. It still hurts if I am to rest my arm at my side.

It was very painful to move my arm or leave my arm resting in a normal position since it would put pressure on my lymph node. I had very limited mobility on days 2,3 and 4 after the vaccine but quickly improved starting day 5 with very minimal pain. I had a video call with a doctor who recommended 800mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours &amp; warm compress on the lymph node. In general, I had very minimal symptoms from the first vaccine except the lymph node swelling &amp; pain. Starting day 5 post vaccine I was basically back to normal &amp; have felt good ever since.

                                                I noticed immediately that the shot hurt, and that it was almost as if I could feel both the beginning and end of the needle. This was unusual for me, because I don&#39;t usually notice pain with vaccines. (It may also be worth nothing that the vaccine was not as centered on the deltoid as usual; it seemed to be injected in a location more anterior than medial.) 36 hours later, while my arm was above my head doing my hair, I suddenly felt a sharp and painful tingling shoot down my arm, with pins-and-needles and numbness. The sensation reached from the top of my arm down the outside around the elbow and heavily culminated in my hand and fingers, especially pinky finger. This sensation somewhat subsided, but lasted for somewhere between 1 and 2 hours.  Since then,  I have experienced pain in my elbow, and sometimes hand/palm and shoulder, and weakness in my hand, fingers, and arm in general. I have described all the different feelings of it as the different stages of having hit your funny bone.

                                                Swelling and redness of the arm within an hour after the vaccine. Tingling began in middle, ring, and pinky fingers within 20 minutes of injection. Numbness began within the first hour. Within two hours, I lost strength and 60% use of my left hand. The pinky and ring finger of my left hand have been either completely numb or tingling ever since my shot over one week ago.   I noticed mild numbness about 3-4 days after the first dose, but assumed I had just slept funny. When my arm became red and hand became tingly after my second dose, I realized this was an effect of the vaccine and not merely a pinched nerve in my sleep.

One week after 2nd vaccine (after 7 days of being sick) menstruation came early and experienced heavy, heavy bleeding. This is now day 2 of heavy bleeding and all other continued symptoms.

                                                I received my first shot on April 6th, 2021, and on April 18th, 2021 I experienced extreme numbness with slight pain in the fold and shoulder of my arm. I went to the ER and they took a cat scan of my neck and reported back that everything looked normal - the nurse said it was most likely Cervical Radiculopathy. Then the following morning around 11 AM, I experienced very intense burning in my chest starting on the right side, eventually moving to the left encompassing my entire upper chest. I also experienced a very bad migraine, which I am typically used to but this one was more of a pressure headache between my temples that I felt in my ears and jaw. I made the decision to go back to the ER and to a different one this time. The ER failed to administer a Covid-19 test and to take bloodwork - both faults that family and friends in the medical field have pointed out to me. The doctor there had me receive an IV, a chest X-Ray, and an EKG. The X-Ray and EKG were both normal. The doctor had ordered a Covid-19 test but the nurse forgot to administer it before my discharge. In my IV I received Benadryl and Reglan along with typical IV fluids. I was also given Pepcid and Mylanta. At the end of my visit, the doctor concluded that he thought it was my acid reflux acting up - gastroenteritis. I went home and continued to experience chest burning, tightness, occasional numbness/pains in my body, and very, very bad headaches. On top of that, I could barely swallow - it felt as if my throat was closing. I took Pepcid and Tums and neither really did anything. After seeing a Cardiologist this same week, they ordered an Echocardiogram and routine bloodwork (metabolic panel). I will also be following up with a GI, and I received a Covid-19 test today and am awaiting the results. It is possible I contracted Covid before my shot, but it is also possible that I am having a delayed reaction to my first vaccination as well. Who knows.

A bad migraine, unable to stand because it caused so much pain in my head. at 8:00PM I went to bed due to the pain. at 1:15 AM, my body was in pain. My right rib cage hurt so bad that I couldn&#39;t sleep on my right side. My legs, back, and pelvic bones were in so much pain as well. I felt as if my bones were going to break or I had severely bruised my bones. Breathing, coughing, sneezing hurt because of my rib cage hurting. My migraine had not gone away, and my lymph nodes were really swollen. Couldn&#39;t put my arms down, my neck was swollen and walking hurt because my legs were swollen. This occurred for 24 hours. Next day, migraine is gone and left a headache. Swelling is still prominent and bones still hurt.

On the evening of the 30th (around 9 PM) noticed that the lymph node above the left clavicle had swollen up to about the size of a marble and was causing pain, both when not being touched and when being touched.

It was the kind of uncomfortable where I swear I could feel it in my bones. Laid in bed until 8:30 when baby boy woke up, promptly threw up, got so nauseated and dizzy that I could not move from the bathroom floor, and had to ask grandma to bring me my medicines. The mix of ibuprofen, migraine medication, and anti-nausea all combined made me feel no symptoms for several hours until they wore off and I lost all ability to stand. My legs just felt so weak. And now I?m finally starting to feel a little better, and it?s been 2.5 days now. Boy, those side effects are no joke. Still worth it though so I don?t bring a deadly virus home to my baby boy ?????

Pfizer shot #1 was administered on 3/12/2021 with minimal effects lasting less than 24 hours (arm soreness, flu-like symptoms, etc.).  1) Severe worsening of costochondritis (chronic chest pain) to the point of breathing difficulty and inability to lie down. Began 4/1/2021 and became unbearable the evening of 4/7/2021, requiring an ER trip the same night (see Item 19). This pain has since continued to come and go, worse than I ever had it before the vaccine.  2) Very severe worsening of tinnitus (ringing/pulsing in ears) - lasted 1.5 months, from 4/1/2021 to around 5/15/2021.  3) Severe hormone imbalance symptoms (waves of severe nausea occurring several times daily, extremely late and painful/heavy period, swelling in ankles &amp; feet, etc.) for ~1.5 months, from late April 2021 to around 5/15/2021. I cannot identify any other changes or life factors besides the vaccine that would have caused these issues.
