On day 6 the same symptoms reappeared and the employee was tested for COVID (negative PCR).  She reports that all of her joints in bilateral upper and lower extremities are extremely sore, she noted that &#34;even her toes were painful&#34;.  She is unable to take NSAIDS because of a history of anaphylactic reaction to Motrin in the past.

Took 800mg Advil prn for about 4 days. Tonsillitis- Right tonsil was inflamed and sore . This started  5 days after the vaccine and lasted 3 -4 days. Used warm water rinses and gargled with Listerine As I am a Nurse with Rheumatoid arthritis , I know there is not much info about subjects with my underlying conditions . I just wanted to report that it did cause a flare in my symptoms but it lasted less than a week. I did hold my Humira for one week after the vaccine as I know it is a &#34;t-cell &#34; inhibitor and I wanted a good result from the  vaccine. I had my second shot today and can update you as to how things go

                                                At 4hrs post vaccination experienced extreme muscular pain between shoulder blades. The following week, as far as I can recall, I began to have tingling from the right shoulder blade down to my hand. I thought I may have a pinched nerve and went to the walk in clinic to be seen by the nurse practitioner that is in the same office as my primary. She examined me and thought it sounded like a pinched nerve and said I was swollen in the area of complaint. Cervical and thoracic x rays were taken (normal) and was told to take Flexeril and steroids. Pain was getting worse and primary told me to  begin taking  Meloxicam and have physical therapy. I have been doing both beginning 1-11-2021. Pain continues with no  improvement. Do not know if my symptoms are caused from the Covid shot, but just seemed to me that it was quite a coincidence that muscle pain began on the same day as receiving the shot.

A 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EK5730, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 16Dec220, at a single dose on arm right for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus 2, hypertension (HTN), migraines, back pains, hypothyroidism, and allergies to latex and kiwi. The patient received the vaccine at a military base. She did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. She had no COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications; she received other medications in two weeks. The patient previously took gabapentin and topiramate (TOPAMAX), in which she experienced allergies. On the second day after receiving the vaccine, 18Dec2020 04:00 AM, the patient started feeling left neck moderate to severe pain, and the pain started radiating down her left arm and down left leg, weakening her joints on those extremities. This continued severely for 3 days. At this time, she continued to feel mild left neck, shoulder and arm pain intermittently. She could not report this immediately due to not having her vaccine documents which she forgot at her workplace as she proceeded to vacation. She had paused in getting the second dose that was due on 07Jan2021, waiting to hear from Pfizer. The patient received NSAIDS and Muscle relaxant medications as treatment for the reported adverse events. Outcome of the events was recovering.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130. It started around 3:30-4:00 this morning (on 12Jan2021) and was mildly improved. she was feeling the chest pressure back pain had lesson, but had pain in the upper jaw, flu like symptoms on 12Jan2021. she said she could not get out of the bed right. She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears.

Last time she went to work after receiving the first one and today (on 12Jan2021), there was no way she could go to work. She took TYLENOL when she got home because she was shivering and took more at 3:30 because she felt miserable because of her chest. She took 1 gram. Her headache did not go away. She got to sleep after she took the TYLENOL. Her back and jaw was bothering her. It felt like the flu. She had upper jaw pain and pain in her back. She didn&#39;t have a good back and just aches.

                                                Severe Left Leg, Hip and Lower left leg pain (Sciatic Nerve) it appears the vaccine may have irritated sciatic nerve pain.  Left left leg numbness.  Decreased mobility, difficulty sitting, walking, and even lying in bed.  Started very quickly without andy known injury.  Pain continued to worsen.  Pain even worse after second injection.  Now two weeks after second shot, the pain is going away.  It is like the nerve irritation is subsiding.  The way the irritation is subsiding makes it seem that the vaccination may have caused irritation to the nerve. After receiving 1st and continuing through the second vaccine, started having severe sciatica pain going down left hip and leg.  Left leg pain and numbness.  Thought I had done something to damage the nerve.  Hurt to sit, hurt to stand and even hurt when in bed. The pain was so severe it caused issues with any mobility.  Took Advil, Aspiring, Tylenol and nothing helped.  Received second vaccine 1/12/2021 the pain continued and even got worse.  It was to the point I couldn&#39;t even walk.  I couldn&#39;t figure out how I had damaged the nerve.  I am now thinking it was from the vaccine.  I believe the vaccine irritated the nerve.  The nerve pain is starting to go away.  Normally if you  have a sciatic nerve issue, it just doesn&#39;t go away on its own.  I know there have been reports of severe back and neck pain.  I believe it can irritate the nerves which cause severe pain.  I wanted this reported in cases others complain of similar issues.  The good thing it is improving.

About a week and a half ago she began feeling numbness of her right leg going up to her upper abdomen with progressively worsening symptoms that have stabilized in the past several days. She also feels that her walking is off but cannot quite describe how or when it started. Exam notable for left-sided cervical myelopathy and decreased sensation on her right side up to a mid-thoracic sensory level.  Of note she has a first cousin on her fathers side with multiple sclerosis and a more distant cousin on her mother&#39;s side with multiple sclerosis.  Father with Parkinson&#39;s disease.  I see that COVID-19 biofire came back positive.  In light of this, COVID myelopathy is on the differential

I reported it to the nurse practitioner but did not want to see her because I knew it would resolve. I am a nurse and expected it would improve on it&#39;s own and it did. I did take Tylenol  for the symptoms when they began. I work in a clinic.

                                                Received Pfizer COVID19 injection at 9:57 am on March 4 at the . As is usual for any shot or IV on me, I immediately tasted something weird in my mouth. It was not as metallic tasting as usual. More plasticy. Shot did not hurt.   Was told to stay in 30 minutes waiting area.I did. The taste remained in my mouth. I left at 10:34 am feeling OK, except for weird taste.  As I drove off the parking lot, I noticed that my mouth and tongue were tingling, with worst of it on my left side.  My throat did not seem to be affected, so I continued driving. Some nasal congestion and coughing.  The tingling turned into numbness in my mouth and tongue, all the way back to top of throat.  I called my primary care doctor at 12:10 pm and left a message.  I received a call back at 2:15 pm from nurse. She told me to take Benadryl and have someone take me to Urgent Care right away to get my vitals checked. I did not take Benadryl, as CDC said it could mask anaphylactic reaction.  I called a friend and she took me . I noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were swelling and painful.  We arrived at 2:45 pm. My vitals were checked, heart and breathing listened to and was checked briefly  for swelling in mouth and throat. There was no swelling. He said he had never heard of this tingling reaction and claimed it is just a side effect and not a serious reaction and that it would probably last a couple of days. He recommended that I watch for new symptoms and take Benadryl. That was $30. We left at 3:10.  We left. I noticed that the numbness was spreading to my lips and up the left side of face and I was getting super tired. Also, my mid to lower back started hurting a lot. I took a Benadryl.  4:30 pm still have same numbness. My eyes got super dry and itchy. My head started to hurt. Some coughing.  5:10 pm dry eye and numbness, more swollen lymph nodes and chills. Pain in calves, upper back, same on both sides.  6:38 weirdly, from the bottom of my thumb to halfway up my arm there is pain. Both arms simultaneously. Worse on the  left.  8:11 pm after bundling up and using a heating pad, plus extra heat, chills are lessened. Lymph nodes very sore in neck. Eyes are not quite as dry. Everything else is the same.  8:48 pm jaw really aches. Intestinal discomfort. Going to bed.  10:39 pm pain from jaw extended up into left ear. Upper part of throat hurts.  March 5, 2021  4:00 am. Body aches have lessened. Left arm sore at shot area.  5:45 am  eyes definitely dry, but not nearly as dry as yesterday. Numbness in mouth , tongue and face has lessened, but still uncomfortably present. Definitely worse on the left side. Little bit of tingling on the left, mostly on cheek from chin to ear. Headache gone. Lymph nodes sore and swollen .  7:00 am went on a walk. Noticed some achyness throughout body. Very tired.  10:51 am The tingling and numbness remain in my mouth, tongue and cheek up to my left eye.  Very tired. Lymph nodes still swollen and sore.

Thursday night I woke up in the middle of the night to the feeling of not being able to breathe. I laid awake for a while but dosed back off and it happened again a little later.   It felt as if someone was sitting on my chest which prompted me to go to the ER the next day.  Various test were done and I was admitted in the hospital for further observation. After admission I developed a massive headache which lasted from that Friday afternoon until that Sunday.  I was released on that Sat and the symptoms seemed to be getting better and by that Sunday evening all symptoms had subsided.

It was not like I could not work or anything, it was just there.  On the 9th day I woke up with fever and chills and a super bad headache and I felt so bad I could not even go seek medical care, I finally went after 3 or 4 days feeling like that. At the walk in clinic they tested me for flu, covid and strep and on the rapid the result was negative but when done the PCR it came back positive (around 12/29/20). I did not have any respiratory issues on this one. I do remember having diarrhea.

A 61-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 18Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been otherwise well prior to receiving the bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020. Within 72 hours, she experienced fatigue, body aches, chills and sweats since 21Dec2020, though she was able to work Xmas week. On 31Dec2020, she contacted her PCP to report neck and leg muscle stiffness and pain, difficulty ambulating, fatigue, chills and sweats. She had a negative COVID test on 02Jan2021 and essentially negative blood work, other than an ESR of 124 mm/hr and CRP of 4 mg/dl. I had a negative PET scan on 12Jan2021. Currently, she had pain/stiffness in her neck and legs, and progressive difficulty w/ ambulation (both of which are worst in the early hours of the AM), and difficulty with ADLs since 31Dec2020. She had been unable to work since 03Jan2021. Her physician had not indicated or endorsed any relationship between her symptoms and the vax. She forewent dose 2 out of an abundance of caution. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events muscle stiffness , neck pain and gait disturbance appeared 13 days after administration of single dose BNT162B2. The Company considers that the events are less likely related to suspect BNT162B2 injection given the weak time association. The detailed clinical course and cause of the events would be helpful for further assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Nurse reported that she had severe side effects but not an allergic reaction. She had the vaccine on Thursday (31Dec2020) and by Sunday (02Jan2021), she had a horrible headache, all the muscles in her shoulders and back were tightened up. And all the week long, she kept trying to keep care with hot packs and cold packs and Advil and Maxalt and all kind of things but could not. Yesterday morning (as reported), she lifted nothing heavy, did nothing different at all and she could not pick her head up. Patient had to seek for medical attention just at her doctor&#39;s office not at the hospital. She had to have somebody and take care of muscle pain. She still have the muscle pain she do have to go back but they did give a muscle relaxant. Patient reported that she never had a reaction ever like this. Nurse further stated that she didn&#39;t do anything as a precursor before the vaccine or after the vaccine. The muscles in her neck were all tied up between her shoulder blades, and her shoulders all was shrugging and could never release the muscles back that was what she felt like. Nurse stated that she just have to take the second shot, that was just the first one. Somebody told her that she have to report it because it took her off the work for two days.

                                                (This is a duplicate entry. I mistakenly entered that patient received the Moderna vaccine, but she in fact received the Pfizer.)  I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine late last Wednesday afternoon (1/20).  Before the 2nd dose, I premedicated (as instructed by my medical office) with Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg (for the histamine blocking effect) since I had terrible itching for about 36 hrs after the 1st dose; but the itching didn&#39;t begin-after the 1st dose-until about 8hrs after the shot &amp; became intense 2 more hrs later.  I had itching the night of the 2nd dose that kept me awake part of the night but was FAR less intense than after the 1st dose.  I came to work Thurs not feeling ill--just cold and tired all day (I attributed to the cold weather and not sleeping well).  Thurs about noon I began feeling ill--like I was coming down with the flu; I went home after my shift and found my temp to be 100.4.  Shortly thereafter it was 100.9.  I thought it would pass by morning so I just showered, drank fluids, took Tylenol and slept.  By 0200ish Fri 1/22 I still had a fever of 100.9 (even with Tylenol on board), a bad headache, sinus congestion, and significant neck and back pain so I called out for work.  I continued to treat the fever and by noon Fri the fever finally had resolved-along with the head, neck and back pain. I&#39;ve been fine since.

                                                I am not sure this is what i shoud be filling out - just wanted to report what seemed like pretty bad symptoms on first dose by all info i have found. The actual shot was given by another facility than listed previously. I recieved the first dose of Pfizer at  Health Dept . No other location information was provided by them.  When i got the shot, a blood vein and possibly a nerve was hit. The nurse did everything properly i think to correct and notify other RN. It caused immediate pain in left fingers and arm felt heavy. That continued for days, but not too bad and injection site itself really was not very sore. My concern was how sick I felt starting within 6 hours of the injection and how long it lasted. I had pretty much instant nausea- no vomiting- mild but persistant, severe fatigue and general overall uneasy/sick feeling. Joint pain started within the 6 hours, along with a few odd pains in neck and right abdomen.  Was extremely chilled for hours, pretty bad tension /tight feeling headache, jittery feeling and foggy. I took a 500mg Tylenol about 8 hours after the shot, and it helped to relieve most symptoms to a degree that was nagging, but tolerable. I pretty much went through this for about the next 3 days and off/on to the 5th day

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 05Mar2021 1:45 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the BNT162B2. Medical history included allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, brain barrier fever, epilepsy, encephalitis and meningitis. She had epilepsy as a child. She gets epilepsy when she gets sick. The last 4 times she got sick she had a seizure. The last seizure was 1 year ago (in 2020). She may have had COVID, but she got really sick and had a seizure. She is not sure if it was COVID or not. If it was the flu, she does not want that again. She had ataxia and ended up in hospital two times but did not stay. Prior to this, she did not go to hospital for 30 years. She was unable to walk, her gait was real bad. The neurological disorder messed her up for a while. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient received the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE first dose and experienced autoimmune response. After the vaccine, she had pain and tingling sensation from head to her to spine (05Mar2021), BP dropped to 70/40 (06Mar2021), seizures (06Mar2021), and delayed allergic reaction (Mar2021). She wanted to know if she should take the second dose or not. She also wanted to know if that would be considered the anaphylactic reaction. It was also reported that the patient experienced funny taste in mouth, back pain, hands tingling on 05Mar2021. The patient further explained that when she got the shot, she had a funny taste in her mouth. It started immediately after she got the vaccine and it lasted 30 minutes. She mentioned this to the people at the facility, but they said she was crazy and no one else has mentioned this. She thought they would be interested, but they did not care. About 20 minutes later she had a tingly sensation. It was in the back of her head that developed into a stingy, painful, heat, funny type feeling. It was all the way down to her back. She later further explained the back of her head was tingling (05Mar2021). Like were the cerebellum is to spine. This sensation is still there, but better. After she felt this feeling her back then started hurting. She bent over and her back went out. She felt achy. She already had what she called a tweaky muscle (05Mar2021). She had pulled a muscle in her back, but it was nothing that had caused a problem. After getting the COVID vaccine it triggered an immune response in her body. She started to have pain at the top of her head down to her hip (05Mar2021). She bent over and she could not stand up (05Mar2021). Her husband had to help her put her pants on and sit down due to this. She started to have horrible back pain (05Mar2021). She could hardly move (05Mar2021). She was having trouble walking (05Mar2021). She was having trouble holding her urine (05Mar2021). On Saturday evening (06Mar2021), her blood pressure started dropping and she later had a seizure. After the seizure occurred it seems like everything got better and she did not have any trouble since. It was very scary. She mentioned she was in the bathroom and there was a tub full of water. She had a hard time already getting to the bathroom. She was in a lot of pain. The amount of pain she had she thinks affected her blood pressure. She had pain in the back, middle of her back. It started at her head, back of head, down her spine, came down to her back and hips. She was hurting a lot and having a terribly hard time getting around. She could hardly walk. She was going to the bathroom because she felt like she had to go. Her husband was helping her sit on the toilet. When she stood up it was like her blood pressure dropped, she almost went headfirst in the tub full of water, but her husband caught her, laid her down, and had a seizure. This was a very unnerving feeling. The seizure did not last more than a minute, maybe two at the very most. The seizure occurred probably around 6PM or 7PM. It did not last long at all. She woke up on the floor. She had been sitting and she thought she had fallen off the toilet. However, her husband had to remind her that a few things happened in between. She almost fell in the bathtub and she has glass doors. She mentioned she felt as clarified and confirmed sped up. She did fall into a cabinet and is bruised up from that seizure (06Mar2021). She is sore from the pain from that. Still inflamed (06Mar2021) possibly due to the seizure. Like she has ruminants of what occurred to back of head, cerebellum. Before she had the seizure, her blood pressure had started dropping. It started dropping in the evening around 5PM or 5:30PM. Mentioned she is a little confused about the time onset because she was hurting so much and bad all day. She does not take any pain medication. She has an autoimmune disease and it is difficult for her to take medications. On top of that, if she wanted to take an Aspirin she was told she should not take one. She was informed she was trying to promote an auto-immune response to the vaccine. As the day ran on, she was in a lot of pain. She had been in pain since Friday and was trying to deal with that. The patient further stated her blood pressure is back, no illness. After the seizure her blood pressure went back to normal and at this time it is perfectly fine. The back pain she experienced went from the brain down to her backbone. The pain is gone. It started to go away after the seizure and by Sunday 07Mar2021 it was totally gone. At first it was like she could not walk (05Mar2021). It was like she/her back was on fire (05Mar2021). The patient also mentioned if she moves her head quickly, she can feel like she will have a headache, hangover. She feels it in her back. She feels like she is near recovery, and this is a feeling she does not thing will stay. She further went on to say her hip where she fell is a different story. However, this is associated to a fall and not a vaccine. She was having this problem when she had the vaccine, but the vaccine caused it to be more and extra aggravating.  She later added, when she first got home along with head tingling her hands were tingling as well. When her brain and hands were going through this tingling sensation, she started to notice the back trouble and it was also in her abdomen area and in her legs causing trouble walking (05Mar2021). The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events trouble walking, could not walk, tingling sensation and hangover was recovering. Outcome of BP dropped to 70/40 was recovered on Mar2021. Outcome of seizures recovered on 06Mar2021. Outcome of funny taste in mouth was recovered on 05Mar2021. Outcome of back pain was recovered on 07Mar2021. Outcome of bruised up was not recovered. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient provided an unrelated causality between the vaccine and event fall.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Fall is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.

                                                I experienced a slight headache  sore arm and elevated blood pressure after the shot. My blood pressure is usually very well controlled. On Monday the 29th, at about 3:30 pm, I started to slur my words. At first we blamed it on the Novocaiine earlier in the day, but I had been talking fine after it and had had it many, many times before and it was worn off. We called my doctor&#39;s office after my right arm and leg became very heavy and awkward. They told me to go to the nearest hospital. When I got there, I presented ass a full stroke. I was very hard to understand and my mouth drooped and I had very little use of my right arm and leg. They ran tests, but could not give me the medication because I was already on Eliquis. They thought they saw a small clot very high up. I was hospitalized over the next four days and improved my speech dramatically after a bad headache on March 30. The doctors go back and forth to whether it was a Acute Ischemic Stroke, which is what my paperwork says and a complex migraine. I do not experience migraines or anything like this ever before.  I did not have a real headache on the 29th. Since my symptoms, right arm and leg difficulties are still here, my Doctor believes it was a stroke. I have an appointment with a Neurologist and I have to have another MRI. I am going to Physical Therapy. My Doctor told me to fill this out, she thinks it may be from the vaccine.

A 61 years old female consumer received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; NDC number 59267-1000-01) on 29Mar2921 at 14:15, in left upper arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same date or within 4 weeks. Medical history included allergic to hamsters (she found out that this one had the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and she knew she had problems with those things), allergic to prednisone (crazy rash, itching), allergic to a lot of different things, sinus infection. Family history included allergy (the whole family had allergies). Concomitant medications included unspecified antibiotics for sinus infection (but it had cleared up by then) and unspecified allergy shots (but not a vaccine). The patient just wanted to report that she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Symptoms began minutes after getting vaccine. The patient experienced getting lots of saliva started with a couple of minutes of getting the shot, tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, couldn&#39;t control her breathing, heart rate it got faster, started getting confused, shaky, wheezing, swelling of her throat, blood pressure dropped, all on 29Mar2021. On 30Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and neck pain but she thought that was more of a vaccination saying it was working. Clinical course of the events included the following information: the patient had to stay for a while since she had allergies normally. She started getting lots of saliva and she thought that was her body saying, she did something, not a big deal. Around 15 minutes, she was at a grocery store, she started walking around, her tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, she couldn&#39;t control her breathing and heart rate, it got faster. She started getting confused, shaky, it wasn&#39;t too good. She made her way back to the place where the injections were done, they were trying to get her to use her epinephrine (EPIPEN). She took a diphenidramine (BENADRYL) while walking around looking for her husband and then took another and was wheezing. She thought BENADRYL would have helped. She should have taken her EPIPEN looking back, she thought BENADRYL would help. They heard wheezing, they contacted the other pharmacist, who contacted EMS then they came and took her to the emergency room on 29Mar2021 in the afternoon. When she was wheeled in, the doctor met her in the hall and he said they could give her a steroid shot. The patient stated she was allergic to prednisone, she got a crazy rash, itching, it&#39;s not just prednisone, it&#39;s an allergy. She got the shot at 14:15 and she was at the hospital by 15:00. The patient thought she was there for 5 hours and then she was sent home. Her blood pressure dropped. The only one she saw was 114/39 but her husband saw it went even lower than that. At the emergency room, they had the automatic thing strapped on so they watched her until it started going back up again. The vaccine shot was probably the easiest shot she had ever had. She had never had any problems. She did not research it very well in the beginning because she thought they should be good. The patient was told to not get the second vaccine. The events also required physician office visit. Allergic reaction symptoms resolved on 29Mar2021 but the swelling of her throat and heart rate lasted about four days, until 02Apr2021. Neck pain resolved on 01Apr2021. Sore arm resolved on 03Apr2021 or 04Apr2021. Blood pressure dropping resolved on an unspecified date in 2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Throughout the day and into the night I had pain, redness, itching and swelling at injection site. The next day (21st) a hard lump developed under the skin where I had the  injection.

I didn&#39;t take any medication for the pain and discomfort as I was told it was beneficial to let the reactions occur without drug interaction or interference.

A 62-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 28Dec2020 at 14:15 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included environmental allergies, she has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume, blood pressure (abnormal) and sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included ongoing lisinopril for blood pressure, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took novocaine but was allergic.  She got all this information when she got the vaccine on Monday at (place name) in (state name). It tells all the side effects from the first injection. She wanted to report that it is the same arm that she got the vaccine in. She has swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm.  It says you can have joint pain, but nothing about swelling. She thought she better report it. This was her first shot. She is supposed to get the second one on 18Jan2021. She wanted to make sure she can take it. She received the vaccine on 28Dec2020. She laid around that day. Today is the first day she doesn&#39;t have arm pain and swelling at the injection site.  It was the first time she has had arm pain. She has never had that with flu shot. The arm pain started within the 15 minutes she was observed. It hurt like hell until that day. She got a bruise at the injection site. It bled a little bit when she put it in. Swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm: she doesn&#39;t know if it was later that day. She can&#39;t remember. She really noticed it yesterday. She has never had joint pain or swelling. She doesn&#39;t have any problems with arthritis. Now her little finger is bigger than the rest of her fingers. It hurts because of the swelling. She doesn&#39;t want to take anything. It might be fluid. She has a high pain tolerance. She keeps bending it thinking it will get better. It isn&#39;t as bad, but its still swelled up. At first she thought it was better, but it is still pretty swollen. To her this is a reaction. She was thinking if she took paracetamol before, it wouldn&#39;t hurt as bad, but she can&#39;t remember if she took it that morning. She takes 500mg before bed for the heck of it at night. It helps her sleep better. She has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume. They think she was allergic to the preservative in the flu shot, but she has never had any trouble with the flu shot since. She has environmental allergies. They thought she was allergic to Novocaine once at the dentist office. Who knows, it only happened once. She&#39;s been to the dentist many times and who knows what they injected and why she reacted that way. She felt like she was going to pass out. They don&#39;t give it to her anymore. She doesn&#39;t know what was in it. She is worried since this vaccine is emergency authorization. She doesn&#39;t want to get the next one and have a worse reaction. She is not sure if she should be worried. The events of swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm were assessed as medically significant. Outcome of the event of &#39;swelling of fingers&#39; was not recovered, the other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event joint pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the event swelling with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1284), intramuscularly in the left arm on 29Dec2020 at 06:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), levothyroxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); both taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date.  The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) and experienced allergy from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, influenza vaccine (FLU VACCINE) for an immunization on an unspecified date (received within two weeks of vaccination).  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: muscles felt really tightened up and stiff when getting out of bed and throughout the day (worst complaint) (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight nausea/nausea (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight fatigue (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight headache (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slightly stiff neck (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, right arm pain (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, back pain (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, the muscles knot up under her rib cage/muscle tightness (non-serious) in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown.  The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020 at work, and she had been experiencing adverse events since. The worst side effect she was experiencing was muscle tightness. At the time of the report, the patient got up at 09:00, and her &#34;back was killing her.&#34; The patient was achy. The patient would tighten up really tight under both rib cages, and it made her nauseous. The patient had been taking ibuprofen (ADVIL) and ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN since she received the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine in her left arm, but her right arm hurt the next day. The next day after that (30Dec2020) she woke up and the right side of her back around the kidney area hurt. It was the right side lumbar. The next morning after that, &#34;her entire back was killing her down the middle of her spine. From her head all the way down.&#34; Since then, it came and went. The patient could not say if it was persisting, improving or worsening for any of the symptoms. &#34;It just grabs her.&#34; The day before the report, the patient thought she was doing better. The patient cleaned the house, and then sat down to eat. The past two nights, it had &#34;hit her really hard during supper time.&#34; Both of her sides of her back would tighten up; &#34;tense up like waiting for an impact before a wreck.&#34; The patient&#39;s back would seize up. The patient could not get comfortable; and would start pacing. Then, she would try to lay down. Last night, it took a half an hour to loosen back up. &#34;It knots up like crazy. It was bad enough, she thought she was going to pass out.&#34; The patient did not know if it was the combination of eating supper or what. The patient thought if she got up that maybe she would feel better. The patient started pacing around. The patient went outside because she thought maybe fresh air would help. When it would tighten up under her rib cage, it made her nauseous. The patient did not know if it was a &#34;vagus nerve thing or what.&#34; The patient was close to throwing up. The muscles knot up under her rib cage. The patient&#39;s back felt like she fell off a horse. It was weird to her that her left arm never bothered her. &#34;Nothing stays the same.&#34; Sometimes it was her entire arm or part of the arm that hurt. Like on top of her forearm. The patient thought she was doing good and then it would come back. When she moved her arm upward, she felt it. The patient said she could deal with the arm pain. It was the knotting up pains that were the worst. The patient tried calling an institute (name withheld) because it happened while eating dinner the other night. The institute (name withheld) &#34;nurse was useless.&#34; The pain was across her sacroiliac area. The patient had been &#34;living on Advil and ibuprofen for her back pain.&#34; The patient had been taking them together. The patient worked nights, and she was planning on going to work the night before the report, but she had to text her boss and tell her she could not come in. The patient was in good health; had perfect blood pressure and her sugar was normal. The patient was not diabetic. The patient&#39;s labs were always normal. The patient was really dreading that second shot. &#34;The flu shot kicked her butt for a couple of days, but this was way worse.&#34; The patient started reading up on the COVID vaccine, and it said usually younger people had severe side effects. That old people have less of a response. The patient did not know why she was experiencing such side effects. At the time of the report, it was day 7 or 8, and she was still feeling bad.  The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

At one point it seemed to settle into my hand. Knuckles swelled arthritis like. When walking up stairs I had significant muscle weakness in my legs and exertional  dyspnea.  Eyes felt &#34;feverish&#34; but had no fever. The next morning while trying to do a routine workout the same thing happened. It was a significant change to my normal condition. The dyspnea was the most concerning. The body aches settled into my lower back. Fatigue was moderate-moderately severe.  As the day went on things waxed and waned.  By the end of 72 hrs. most symptoms subsided. Friday 01/08/2021 I had a completely normal workout, no exertional  dyspnea, fatigue subsided, no body aches. Back to normal. I would consider the symptoms to have been  Moderate&#43;.

                                                Almost immediately after the injection, I noticed a metallic taste. It was mild enough that it did not interfere with the taste of foods or drinks. It was noticeable whenever I had not had anything by mouth for a while. This lasted for 2 to 3, maybe 4, days.  Soreness at the injection site, and stiffness of the arm, began the evening after the injection.  Warming applications and moving the arm relieved these symptoms.  They were gone the next day.

                                                I had my first vaccination on 1/11/21 at HD. The reaction was typical- significantly sore red inflammed arm over deltoid muscle that resolved after 3 days. Second dose given 21 days later- some swelling and soreness, low grade fever. Then 3 days later, I awoke, turned in bed and experienced an intense shearing pain in my neck and arm. The pain was the worst ever felt, and was not improved with NSAIDS, Acetaminophen, Hydrocodone, or Tramadol. I went to an urgent care center on 1/16 where a tentative diagnosis of sprained neck was made. The sypmptoms continue with slight improvement with steroids, and a muscle relaxant. I am concerned because I understand that covid itself can impact the nervous system considerably.  I am awaiting improvement in symptoms and if none seen then I will see my primary care MD

A 62-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT#: GL3248 (Caller said that the G may be an E.)), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at second single dose for working with cancer patients. Medical history included ongoing diabetic and ongoing hyperthyroidism, both diagnosed about 6 years ago and were under control. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 for working with cancer patients (First dose, lot number: EJ1685, injection in the left arm). On 11Jan2021 the patient had chills, joint pain, and lower GI symptoms. Her lower GI symptoms included diarrhea. Then caller clarified that it was not diarrhea but the urge to go. The stools were solid. She also had lots of flatulence. She was also wiped out of energy, around like 2 PM on 11Jan2021 she went up a flight of stairs and was so exhausted. The patient is a nurse. She was in her office that day and had to literally lay on the floor because she was so wiped out of energy. She left work early and went to bed. Then the next day 12Jan2021, she was unable to get out of bed the whole day. She is so sleepy and has no energy. She went to bed last night at 08:30, but is still so sleepy. Today she is feeling better, but still had lower GI symptoms. She was also feeling cold, which she normally is always hot. She was having to put 5 blankets on her. Outcome of the event chills was recovered on 12Jan2021, of events joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed was recovering, of events flatulence and feeling cold was unknown. The reporter considered the event chills, joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed as serious (disability) and related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported chills, joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, given the plausible temporal association.

                                                (Friday)Immediately after the injection-dizziness, vertigo, tunnel vision, blurred vision, pin point pupils, unable to talk, headache,   facial  and lip numbness, numbness traveled down the right side of my body (side of injection) trembles, weak legs, very weak all over. EMTs were called but I didn&#39;t go to the hospital.  My son picked me up and took me home because I was unable to drive.  On the way I experienced loss of vision and speech for about 5 minutes.  When I got home, my legs were so shaky that I had to have help walking.  I started getting severe chills that took 3 hours to get warm (2 heavy blankets, space heater, and heating pad).  I was very fatigued and felt bad the rest of the day.  (Saturday)The next day I had flu-like symptoms; headache, joint aches, chills, nausea, extreme fatigue.  Sunday was better but still had to rest most of the day because when I would stay up for over 30 minutes, the symptoms would return.  Monday-  stomach cramps, headache, fatigue  but went to work (30 minutes late due to stomach) and left 30 minutes early.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 15Jan2021 12:53PM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the Pfizer vaccine. Medical history included allergies/allergy from childhood 4 years old, back problem from 2001, back surgery in 2015, vaginal dryness, high cholesterol, depression, acid reflux, surgery in 2015, physical therapy, and allergy to mold, dogs, roaches. She has multiple allergies from childhood including allergy to mold, dogs, and roaches. She also mentioned she has had back problems since her first surgery in 2015. All of these predate treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine and Lipitor. She got to where she couldn&#39;t stand up straight, but she went to physical therapy. She had surgery in 2015. She had a problem in 2018 and they gave her shots and that helped. Family history was none. Concomitant medications included estradiol (ESTRING) (for three years) for vaginal dryness, fish oil (taking for three to four years) for high cholesterol, paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL) (taking for 20 years) for depression, cyamopsis tetragonoloba gum (BENEFIBER FIBER SUPPLEMENT) (using for a year), vitamin d3 (VITAMIN D3) (using for five years; she used to be on calcium but it can cause heart problems so her doctor told to take Vitamin D), dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) (taking for five years) for acid reflux, (ALLEGRA) (taking for 5 years ) for allergy, (QNASL) (using for 3 years), allergy shots (used forever) for allergy and stool softener (taking for 5 years) to &#34;keep things moving&#34;; all were from unspecified dates and ongoing. The patient previously took atorvastatin (LIPITOR) for high cholesterol from 2017 to 2017 and experienced back pain from 2017 to 2017 (recovered). She also previously took calcium. The patient experienced &#34;received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 15Jan2021 at 12:53PM in the left arm/ she noticed a sore arm right afterward&#34; on 15Jan2021, lower left side back pain on 20Jan2021, and rash on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient called to report a problem with her lower back after receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine. &#34;I&#39;ve had surgery and a couple of shots, the CAT scan kind. I have been fine for a while, just had a sore arm and yesterday I noticed a problem with my lower back and thought it may have been because I painted, but it is still bothering me. I remembered when I went on Lipitor I started having problems with my back about 3 weeks in, same deal. The doctor took me off and I went back on a month later and I started having problems again. Because I don&#39;t know if it was the vaccine, I am wondering if I should get the second dose.&#34; She clarified she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 15Jan2021 at 12:53PM in the left arm. She noticed a sore arm right afterward which lasted at least 48 hours. Then on 20Jan2021, she noticed lower left side back pain. Mentions she thinks it is at the L4 or L5 and this is the same place she had a shot there in 2018 for back pain and previously had surgery on that location in 2015. With regard to Lipitor, she is unsure of the exact year, but states it was probably back in 2017. After taking Lipitor she noticed her back pain coming back. Her doctor took her off of Lipitor for a month and it got better. Then he put her back on Lipitor and she had the same back pain problem. She stated that she is unsure if she will take the second dose and asked with regard to her back pain should she take the second dose. Outcome of  &#34;received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 15Jan2021 at 12:53PM in the left arm/ she noticed a sore arm right afterward&#34; was recovered on 18Jan2021, outcome of lower left side back pain was not recovered, while outcome of rash was unknown.

                                                heart rate of 160; severe nausea; arm soreness; muscle soreness in left arm; general fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 62-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 62 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EK5730) administered on 30Dec2020 at 01:00PM and the patient said she did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. The patient received no concomitant medications. She stated that she had no other recent vaccinations or new medications. One thing that may be important is that she did do a 7 day detox that ended the Sunday before her second vaccine dose, so her body was pretty much having no impurities in it, and she has been eating clean since then, maybe having something foreign put into her body set it off after detox. The patient experienced arm soreness and general fatigue on 21Jan2021, and on 22Jan2021 at 01:00 she experienced severe nausea and heart rate of 160 (which was reported serious as medically significant). Patient reported that after her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine she had a significant side effect that didn&#39;t happen until 10-12 hours after getting the vaccine. She did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. After the second injection her arm was sore, and she had general fatigue. She had the second dose injected Thursday at around 01:00PM, then at one in the morning her heart rate was 160, and she had severe nausea. She was that way until 08:00AM. Her heart rate was 120 probably by 09:00AM, then came down to 100, she has never had anything like that before. Her arm soreness was a deep muscle soreness to her left arm. The fatigue was a couple hours later after she got the second dose of the vaccine. The nausea started at 01:00AM, and lasted until six to eight, she did no treatment, and it improved and is still gone now. For her heart rate of 160, she had no treatment, though she probably should have gone to the hospital, but it came down. She usually runs a heart rate of 60-70, it went back to normal Friday, probably in the afternoon on the 22nd, about 12 hours after that started. The patient stated that she feels this is medically significant for her heart rate to be that high. She had contacted her primary care physician (PCP), but they didn&#39;t call her back for 4-5 hours, by then she was fine. She doesn&#39;t think that this was treated well by her PCP, and that they should have done an electrocardiogram (EKG) and follow up labs, she is changing her PCP as a result of this. She is concerned about the people who will be getting their second dose, she has been helping with these, they have patients that are over 100, they wouldn&#39;t survive that rapid heartbeat. The outcome of arm soreness/muscle soreness and fatigue was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event of heart rate increased was likely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I am submitting this as a supplementary report to the report assigned on March 1, 2021.  This is day 10 after the vaccine and my mast cell reactivity symptoms have increased by the day--internal and external swelling, flushing, pruritis, wheezing, tightness in chest, as well as pain and pressure in arm pits, groin, and ears.  By late afternoon I am severely fatigued, weak, and foggy-headed.  These symptoms are consistent with those I experienced during the twenty years when my mast cell disease was unstable.  Through identification of my triggers and avoidance of the same, I have been symptom and medication free for the past three years--until taking the Covid-19 vaccine.  It appears that the vaccine has reactivated an excessive degranulation response in my mast cells and that response is getting worse as my body responds to the vaccine.  I realize that the percentage of persons who suffer from a condition like mine is small, but I would have appreciated having the information that I am submitting to you when I was weighing the pros and cons of vaccination.  I know from the twenty years of navigating this disease that there is nothing that can be done at this point other than taking various H1 and H2 blockers.  This vaccine appears to be undoing the hard-won level of stability achieved through years of careful lifestyle management.

A 62-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982, expiration date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shingles which she contracted in 2019, about one and a half years ago, it was a shingles on her back and lower back which she stated were the worst place for shingles has attacked, it left her with severe pain in both legs; diabetes; and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included losartan, atenolol (a beta-blocker), and metformin for diabetes. The patient took the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and after about 2-4 days (Jan2021), she had a little chill and got very tired. She had to take care of herself. She was very tired not realizing it was the shot she took. She also felt like she has no energy. The patient was working from home but a lot of times, she was lying on the couch. Over the weekend (Jan2021), she had a slight pain on left arm. About a week or 8-10 days later (2021), she got very tired and couldn&#39;t even sit up. Her body was not itself. She started to feel like a bus rolling over her, like somebody took a baseball bat and beat her really bad. The patient uses her arm a lot and her hand started to feel a lot of pain. She couldn&#39;t even touch herself; it was so sensitive. She took paracetamol (TYLENOL) but it didn&#39;t work. She had celecoxib (CELEBREX) an anti-inflammatory, she thought she was maybe inflamed, but it didn&#39;t work. She had some diclofenac cream, she rubbed it, but it didn&#39;t work. The patient had shingles about a year and a half ago which was very bad. She just felt weak and didn&#39;t feel like herself anymore. She had a little bit of nausea and her whole body was really terrible. When she had the shingles, it left her with severe pain in both legs. She saw a neurologist and told her that she would have to take pregabalin (LYRICA) and it would go away. So, when she had severe pain last week, she took pregabalin but it didn&#39;t help. The patient took half of acetaminophen, oxycodone (PERCOCET) as she was not the person who takes pills, but it didn&#39;t work. Her body was so severe on Friday, it was not going away, the pain was there 24 hours. The patient has been experiencing this for 8-10 days now. She took one PERCOCET on Friday and had a slight relief and didn&#39;t took anything again. She kept rubbing the diclofenac cream, but it was not much of a relief. This morning, she has to work, she was sitting so she took PERCOCET. She is getting her second shot on Friday, 12Feb2021. She asked how she will feel after the second dose if she felt that way after the first dose, if the first shot was adequate, and if she should take the second dose. She stated that she didn&#39;t want to take the second dose. Her body felt so weak including her fingers and hand. It triggered the shingles pain in her back and felt like she was beaten up by someone. She has to lie down for the pain in her back. She also mentioned that she couldn&#39;t sit for so long as her waist and back were so painful. She was lying on a heating pad and ice and nothing was working. She even has a hard time getting up. She thought what happened was it triggered the shingles pain in her back and also left her with a problem under her feet. The shingles left her with some kind of damage when she took the shot. It was really bad. Her son was a physician and was concerned because last week, it got so bad, she didn&#39;t come out, she was in bed and bedridden from Friday to Sunday. She had no appetite, she didn&#39;t eat. The only thing that the patient had was diabetes and high blood pressure, but it was under control. She just checked her pressure and its was 130/80, and now, because of the pain, it went up a little bit, but before my pressure was like 120 something, over 68 or 72 it was always around the 60s and 70s. Since she was having this, it was a little high. The outcome of the events was unknown.

This case was also received from Pfizer sponsored program.  A 62-year-old female patient received the 2nd dose (at the age of 62-years-old) of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot# not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in Feb2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung and back problems (back pain). It was reported that the patient normally took an inhaler (not steroid inhaler because she didn&#39;t want to interfere with immune response), and other things. The patient previously took prednisone which started at 40mg for 2 days, 30 for 2 days, 20 for 2 days then goes down to zero for back pain (stopped taking 4 days before the second dose of the vaccine). The patient received the first dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE (Lot# not provided) on 29Jan2021 (at the age of 62-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s 2nd dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE was administered a week ago (Feb2021) Friday. It was reported that she got very ill initially which she said joint pain in hands and headache noted in Feb2021 (Saturday) which wasn&#39;t so bad. On Saturday afternoon, she reported shortness of breath, coughing with extreme pain (painful cough) and described a feeling of bugs crawling in her lungs, bugs front and back, and itching, and no one else reported it. The patient kept sleeping and waking up, thinking she was alright, but the coughing and lasted until Sunday evening, it was a very painful cough, and a creeping sensation in lungs front and back. She missed work on Monday. The events (joint pain in hands, headache, shortness of breath, coughing with extreme pain (painful cough) and itching) were medically significant as she was unable to go to work. It was also mentioned that since the patient stopped taking the Prednisone 4 days before the second dose of the vaccine. The patient had an exacerbation of pain (it came back).

A 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 62-years of age) dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 01Apr2021 10:20 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (to not get Covid). Medical history included ongoing multiple sclerosis which was diagnosed back in the early 90&#39;s and the doctors saw no new reasons on any part of the MRI of the brain, neck, and spine, there were no new lesion and she has had no problems for 30 years; and she had sinus pressure. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EN6208) dose 1 in her left arm on 11Mar2021 (at 61 years of age) for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that the patient had a stroke after getting the Pfizer vaccine. She stated that she was in the ICU for 3 days. They tested every part of her body and couldn&#39;t find a reason. She added that she had a clot in her brain with a small bleed and they told her it was highly unusual to happen in that part of the brain. It was stated that it was where the blood goes from the brain to the heart. She mentioned that it was a dural venous sinus thrombosis. She was in the neuroscience ICU for 3 days and her left leg and left arm are still weak and she will start PT. She wanted to talk about reporting and let us know this was happening and that the neuroscience team reported it to the CDC online while she was in the hospital.

She mentioned that she got the vaccine in a Thursday morning and by Friday she had weakness in her left arm and left leg and a headache. She added that there was a high probability that it was related, that it was a new vaccine and it was hard to say it definitely happened from that but it was a high probability. She had other questions, she has heard from other people with other vaccines and people with Covid experience blood clots. She stated that she was wondering what if it was with the vaccine that is reacting to what it thinks is Covid, or is it the body&#39;s response. She was wondering if Pfizer comes out with a booster with the variant, should she not take the booster. She stated that it could have killed her if they had not caught the blood clot in her brain and had she not gone to the ER it could have killed her and she was concerned about taking a booster. She provided that she had the Pfizer vaccine on 01Apr2021 in the morning and had a headache that same day and who knows when on Friday morning she had weakness in her left leg and left arm, so within 24 hours. She provided that she went to the ER Saturday 03Apr2021, that she wasn&#39;t sure about it and you don&#39;t go running for everything. Stated she was admitted 03Apr2021 and was discharged 05Apr2021 or 06Apr2021. She clarified that her headache was totally gone, that she had sinus pressure that was not related and had it as a constant in her life, it was normal for her and happens with changes with the weather.

                                                As I was sitting at my computer and suddenly I could barely keep my eyes open, I was so tired I couldn&#39;t lift my arms and once I closed my eyes, I could not muster the strength to open them.  I felt like I was going to faint and then I got nauseated and I knew I was going to throw up. With my husband&#39;s help, I did manage to get to the bathroom (about 6 steps away).  I threw up and immediately sat down in the nearest chair.  I threw up a second time into a vessel after that.  I then got a massive headache and chills.  I could barely walk with assistance up the stairs to go to bed.  I have never been more fatigued.  After going to bed, I slept all night and woke the next day still fatigued, but nothing like the night before.  I was able to work, even though I felt really tired.  I did not have much of an appetite all day and two days later, I still feel fatigued.

Chills on Friday morning in the middle of night; woke up and my temp was 101.3 and I was feeling bad all day; had headache and went back to bed. Still have pain in hip/knee and joints and those pains got really bad after the vaccine - increased. Doctor  vist told me to use Ibuprofen to 3 times a day for that pain.  Shortness of breath continues from Covid symptoms and so does the hip/joint pain - it has decreased.

I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

A 63-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Mar2021 11:00 AM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history predating treatment with the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine included fracture on that left foot where the toenail came off and she had a wound that wouldn&#39;t heal. She was fully recovered from the foot injury in Dec2020. Then she came down with a positive COVID 19 test on 11Dec2020. Symptoms started on 07Dec2021 with a fever and everything and she ended up in the ER with bilateral pneumonia and they sent her home on 17Dec2020. Then later, she was admitted to the hospital on 25Dec2020 with excruciating pain in her chest, lungs and legs; and she was having shortness of breath. She was found to have a  DVT, PE and bilateral pneumonia. She was discharged 30Dec2020. She thinks she has the long time syndrome after COVID. She was still having shortness of breath, itchiness, and extreme fatigue from the COVID 19 infection but her HCP advised her to get the COVID 19 vaccine anyway. She thinks the chest congestion and cough were cleared up now, but she has noticed hair loss. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient stated that her husband, son and herself received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 02Mar2021. They all waited the 15 minute waiting period after receiving the vaccine for a reaction and was fine. Her husband and son went ahead to the car and she went to use the restroom. 20 minutes later, while in the restroom, she got a random ting outside her left foot like an electrical type very painful pain that came up the outside left ankle, leg, and calf. She had an excruciatingly painful electrical feeling like a zing that shot from her left foot and ankle to her calf/ zinging sensation left ankle on 02Mar2021. The pain was from the same foot that she had broken before. It happened once and she was like what was that and then it stopped. Maybe 5 seconds went by then it happened again this random zap of electrical feeling that she cant really explain but it gave her whole body goosebumps. It did it 5 times in a row with pauses in between in the same exact place left lower leg. After it stopped and as she was washing her hands she had a really sharp pain in her breast on 02Mar2021 and then that was it. She walked out to the car and she didn&#39;t say anything to her husband or son because she didn&#39;t really understand what was happening and she felt fine other than the crazy pain and once it ended it ended. When she got home and in the afternoon because she was home working remotely it happened again the same exact spot left lower leg and the pain was excruciating when it was happening. This time she thinks it was four times in a row with pauses in between same exact spot just in her left lower leg. This time she told her husband &#34;I didn&#39;t say anything before but its happening again and its weird.&#34; She never had this feeling before. Adds it was so excruciating. She was just holding her breath counting how many times it will occur. It happened again that night and then she almost afraid to go to sleep because the pain would wake her up but nothing happened as she slept. She woke up the next morning and had to go to an ophthalmologist appointment and happened again while she was sitting in the chair. She had another episode of the painful zing in her foot. That was the last time it did and it might have happened again but altogether she had 4-5 episodes in a 24 hour period after receiving the vaccine. Each time she would have several painful zings. She also noticed a tingling on her lip on 03Mar2021; a painful zinging sensation on her right breast; and a tingling sensation on one finger of her hand that happened one time on 03Mar2021. That day, she had a tingling in one finger and a zap or electrical like feeling in her upper lip and that was it those didn&#39;t really bother her they were more tingling and electrical feeling. She called her primary doctor and he hadn&#39;t heard of anything like it before but he cant rule it out. He said the only way you would know is if you got the shot again but she states she is a little scared. She would like to know if this side effect has been reported before and if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. She was scheduled to receive the next dose on next Tuesday, 23Mar2021. She mentioned she had blood work this week but she has no results at this time. The outcome of sharp pain in her breast/ painful zinging sensation on her right breast was recovered on 02Mar2021, of excruciatingly painful electrical feeling like a zing that shot from her left foot and ankle to her calf was recovered on 03Mar2021, of pain that came up the outside left ankle/ zinging sensation left ankle was recovered on 04Mar2021, of tingling on her lip/ zap or electrical like feeling in her upper lip was recovered on 03Mar2021, and of tingle on the right hand finger/ electrical feeling was  recovered on 03Mar2021.

When she woke up, it woke her up at 5 o&#39;clock in pain and her shoulder was kind of swollen, it has got big old knot and it was red and it was apparent itchy and she could not scratch it so, she thought about it and she got an ice pack, so she put ice on it. She was holding ice on it now, trying to sooth it. She was wondering where she would go for reaction, she knew she had reaction like this before so she had a side effect from it, and her arm was kind of still stiff and sore. She did not go to the emergency or urgent care because she looked at left and she looked at the right and like she said, it was swollen and she got big old knot and it was red. She also stated that she did not take Tylenol today. She did not know what she wanted to get through to somebody and she needed to speak to somebody on what she needed to do.

Control No.: 21K-163-3848385-00). A 63-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6207) intramuscular in the right arm on 18Mar2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; adalimumab (HUMIRA) solution for injection, subcutaneously, from an unspecified date at an unspecified dose and frequency for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Medical history included polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), RA, hypothyroidism, anemia. The patient had no known allergies. It was unknown if the patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications included prednisone, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), folic acid, calcium carbonate (CAL). The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of BNT162B2. On 18Mar2021 (within 4 hours of the vaccination), the patient experienced a rheumatoid arthritis flare up. The clinical course was as follows: on 18Mar2021 at 15:00, the patient experienced pain in elbow and finger pain (like trigger finger of both hands). On Mar2021 (within 24 hours), all fingers were involved, the patient&#39;s grip strength was decreased (she could not make a fist or grasp or grip/ inability to grip or grasp with her hands) and experienced left wrist pain. On Mar2021 (within 48 hours), the patient experienced finger edema, was still unable to make fist or grasp, experienced painful shooting pains up inner arms, right ear &amp; head pains. The patient increased the prednisone dose to 4 mg daily as treatment for the events. On 21Mar2021 at 11:00 (72 hours after vaccination), the patient continued to experience bilateral arm pains, slight hand grips but could not lift, new right knee and right outer foot pains. On 21Mar2021 (94 hours after vaccination), there was less arm pain and finger edema, continued right ear/head pains. The patient saw the primary physician, there was no ear infection and the physician agreed with the prednisone increase. The physician felt the patient should not take the second vaccine dose and alerted the rheumatologist. On 22Mar2021 (116 hours after vaccination), the patient was able to lift and grasp with both hands, had less ear and arm pain. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19. The action taken with adalimumab in response to the events was unknown. The reporter&#39;s causality for the events trigger finger, inability to grip or grasp with her hands, severe flare of RA symptoms 4 hours post vaccine, pain in arms and elbows, pain in ears was not provided. The clinical outcome of rheumatoid arthritis flare up, trigger finger, &#34;grip strength decreased/could not make fist or grasp or grip/ inability to grip or grasp with her hands&#34;, pain in arm, right ear &amp; head pains was resolving; while of pain in elbow was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject vaccine contributed to the RA flare and other events.  The reported events may likely represent intercurrent medical conditions.   There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

But Friday (02Apr2021) it got worse, she took only one paracetamol (TYLENOL Arthritis PAIN 650 mg, Count size 24 caplet, Lot: SLA055, Expiration: Jul2023) and felt okay.  On Saturday (03Apr2021) happened again, she also took one in the morning and at night. On Sunday (04Apr2021), she felt again in morning took 1 paracetamol and at night she took another one, the pain was unbearable. Next Monday (05Apr2021), she almost called 911 at 7pm but she didn&#39;t do it, her neighbor is a nurse for 46 years and she told her to take two paracetamol. Last night (05Apr2021), she took two.  She could not sit down and sleep before (Apr2021).  She was able to sleep.  This morning she felt it again (06Apr2021), her neighbor told her to take 2 for 3 times or every 6 hours.  She took 2 this morning.  She is scared.  She called her doctor. She was going to call 911 last night because the pain was bad and she was scared.  The muscle pain at first was on the right leg only and last night (05Apr2021), it was both legs. She needs the right medicine.  The doctor said she should call Pfizer and discuss. She wondered if it is okay to take second dose and what the right medication is to take to help with the pain. Patient did not visit emergency room. The patient assessed the report as serious. Outcome of muscle pain in legs was not recovered, outcome of other events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 63-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8729), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Apr2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as many medical conditions, names unknown, just a combination of medical problems. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications, some of which were taken in the morning. The patient had the vaccine on 02Apr2021 (reported as &#34;Friday or Saturday&#34;) in the afternoon and had a bad adverse reaction to it. The patient had swelling in the face, hives on her back, itching that was in her back, and, allergic reactions on 02Apr2021. Due to these, since she was just in a medical facility, doctor and nurses over there were able to inject her with Benadryl that was a strong dose, in a long needle given into the muscle and stuff. It was good enough that she got up and was sent home. She then seemed to be fine but on Monday, 05Apr2021, she couldn&#39;t get out of the bed as the pain all the way down to her back was killing her, like it was paralyzing her. She could not even get out of the bed for like hours. The neck and back pain on Apr2021 were pretty intense, and she does not know where and how it came so she was trying to figure that out and realized she just recently had the vaccine injection. She knew that there could be some kind of reaction, but she was not sure if it were from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure she did not get something serious because she already has rare conditions. She added she did not have any prior treatment for these because she did not even think like this was even a side effect of the Pfizer vaccine but now she was wondering if it was because she had not taken anything prior. She does not know if it was related or not and she was concerned about it. She wanted to know what she could do if these were side effects because she knew there were some people that have something to do with the spinal cord and she was not sure if their symptoms were like hers or not. She wanted to know if she would need treatment for it and if it was an adverse reaction. She added that the swelling in her face and, itching that was in her back went away the same day when she was given the vaccine. The outcome of the events swelling in the face and itching that was in her back was recovered on 02Apr2021. The outcome of the other remaining events was unknown.

She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4; was not able to walk at first; her arm was cold; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 63-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 08:00 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included high blood pressure that was diagnosed 2-3 years ago, diabetes; she was prediabetic, heart;cholesterol has been high for about 30 years; since she was in her 30s; all from an unknown date and ongoing. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 63-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no prior vaccination in four weeks. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin taken for blood cholesterol and takes 20mg once a day prior to stroke and in the hospital they increased it to 40mg once a day and ongoing; ramipril taken for blood pressure and she was prescribed with this medication for a while prior to her stroke. It was discontinued in the hospital. Stated that she did not take it everyday because she was allergic to it; and sitagliptin (JANUVIA [SITAGLIPTIN]) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing and stated that she has been taking for quite a while. On 24Feb2021 she had her second shot. She said that everything was fine that morning; that afternoon her arm was sore. Stated she thought nothing of it. That evening she entertained guest. They were saying she sounded different; they said her speech sounded slurred. She had gotten her vaccine at around 08:00. Again, she didn&#39;t think anything about her speech. On 25Feb2021, she got up and did some laundry going up and down the steps. Stated that it was difficult because her arm was still sore. She cleaned the house. At around 15:30 she was doing bills and noticed that her writing looked like a baby&#39;s scribble. On 26Feb2021, she noticed that her left arm was weak and was told by her doctor to go to the Emergency Room where they told her she had a stroke. She added that it seemed like her arm was cold for a number of weeks. Stated she was the type to wear t-shirts in the winter because she was always hot. During those weeks she was wearing heavy clothes and was under blankets. She was just now starting to feel more like herself and not so cold all the time. The patient was unable to recall time frame when this symptom began. The events did require a visit to emergency room and physician office. The patient was hospitalized for 4 days due to the events from 26Feb2021 to 01Mar2021. During hospitalization, the patient saw a cardiologist, neurologist, her primary care provider, and the hospitalists who all said it was very suspicious that her stroke happened right after her vaccine. Before she got her second vaccine, she was doing embroidery and everything she normally does; nothing was wrong. They did a CAT Scan that showed nothing. Then the MRI of the brain showed a Pontine Stroke on 26Feb2021. Cardiologist put a heart monitor on her and could not find anything. They were looking for A-Fib or something like that when she was on the heart monitor in the hospital; but it never showed anything irregular. She had a loop recorder implanted to monitor her heart and they haven&#39;t found anything wrong on it. She had heart tests, carotid artery tests, ultrasound of her heart and nothing was found on those tests. They pretty much told her in the hospital that they couldn&#39;t find a reason for her stroke. She kept asking about the vaccine. They did not rule it out as a cause, but they also did not say it was the cause. All the doctors said they could not pin her stroke on the vaccine. They stated it was suspicious and that they had seen 2-3 other patients with a similar situation. One of the doctor&#39;s told her he would not rule it out. They did an ultrasound of her carotids and heart and did not find anything on those tests that would have caused her stroke. She was having lasting effects related to her stroke. Her arm was still sore at times, stated it was a different kind of sore and could be related to all the therapy she does now. The lingering effects after stroke was reported as she was not able to walk at first. She&#39;s been doing therapy focused on her left side. Stated that her left side was the dominant side and she cannot write or type. She couldn&#39;t do the report online due to the difficulty with typing. She wanted to make sure this was reported. The patient has been doing therapy for 7 weeks, twice a day; and stated she likely still has months more of therapy to try and get her left side back to normal. She said that simple daily duties are difficult. The patient also stated that she was prediabetic before her hospitalization with her number (A1c) usually being 6.5-6.8. She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4. She doesn&#39;t know what made it go up. Then states she doesn&#39;t know if the vaccine made it go up or not. She has a follow up with the neurologist soon. The patient also reported medications she has been taking since her stroke and hospitalization; but not prior to her vaccine which included Amlodipine-Benazepril:  5-20mg once a day and Aspirin: 325mg once a day. The patient stated that stroke and heart problems do not run in her family. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 64-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Batch/lot number: EL1284, Expiry Apr2021, intramuscularly on 30Dec2020 02:15 (Dose 1), right arm as a single dose (age at vaccination 64 years old) for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included allergy (usually in the fall she has allergy problems).  Her age is considered high risk, works in medical profession (Surgical Tech). Concomitant medication included levocetirizine (Walgreen&#39;s generic) 5mg, tablet, by mouth, at night for allergy. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine last 30Dec(2020) and after 2 days (on 01Jan2021) she developed symptoms: Sore arms, severe sore throats, back ache/ back was sore, temperature was up / low grade temp (never high), coughing, body aches. Her back and her legs were sore. Her whole body was achy. It was &#34;like flu-ish kinda.&#34; She also had a headache. She started getting the sore throat and headache on 01Jan2021, and she felt a little cold on 02Jan2021. On 02Jan(2021), her first temperature was 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She states she had everything except for the GI issues. Around 02Jan(2021) or 03Jan(2021), her symptoms were progressively getting worse. She was told to get COVID tested. There were three exposures since Christmas Eve. So, she went and got a rapid COVID test (04Jan2021) and it came back negative. They also sent out a test that day. She was also tested for Strep (04Jan2021) too because her throat was so sore. It was almost like she had like thrush along with it. She states it was almost like a thrush because she had like a white tongue (onset 03Jan2021). Her throat was so sore, but it was a different kind of sore throat compared to a sore throat she has had before. She explains where the nasopharynx was at the top, it&#39;s almost like it was sore from there. It was sore to swallow, it was &#34;a bizarre sore throat.&#34; She clarified she noticed the &#34;thrushy&#34; part of her throat around 03Jan2021. The strep test ended up being negative but she believes she had thrush because she was given medication and the medication was clearing that up. However, she still had the symptoms. Because her symptoms only started a few days before, they thought she should maybe wait a couple of days and if she is not feeling any better, she should be retested (for COVID). She went back again yesterday (07Jan2021). She had another Rapid COVID test and also a flu swab and both tests came back negative. She mentions they also did another COVID test (the send out type) and she should get that back around 1pm to find out the results of that.  They also did a CBC (07Jan2021) and everything was normal. Her white count was at 7. She was waiting for the 3rd COVID test result today (08Jan2021).  She reported that about three days afterwards, she didn&#39;t notice the soreness in /her arm. Her throat has improved. Her fever was down to 98 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday (07Jan2021). She states she was feeling better today (08Jan2021). She commented &#34;the lethargy, though.&#34; She emptied the dishwasher yesterday (07Jan2021) and had to sit down after emptying it. She states her symptoms have her a little worried. She recovered from the sore arms in Jan2021. The patient was recovering from  the severe sore throat, back ache, low grade temp, coughing, body aches/ whole body was achy, believes she had thrush, white tongue, legs were sore, headache, and felt a little cold. The outcome of the event lethargy was not recovered. She was wondering if this was a reaction to the vaccine.

                                                I experienced excruciating pain in my middle back--it woke me from my sleep. It felt like that entire area was in pain. I could not been over without twinges of spasms. I could walk without problems--including up and downstairs (with extreme caution).  On 1/16/21 I started taking Bayer for Body and Back pain and using  Icy Hot on the area that hurt. I called my doctor&#39;s office for med for spasms and she said I need to see a doctor. I wanted to be compliant with her recommendations. The doctor suggested Extra Strength Tylenol every three hours.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020 (8 weeks ago). Concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the vaccine, she got sick as a dog and couldn&#39;t work. She had a fever that reached 100.0, she had body aches. It was explained that she has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands. The caller continues that her joint hurt, all of them, but it was throbbing the most where she has visual arthritis. To sum it up, she had chills, nausea, and body aches the first day. The caller took Tylenol regardless of what the paper said; this was on Friday, 08Jan2021. She kept taking the Tylenol. The next day, she was still tired but when she quit taking the Tylenol on the 2nd day the symptoms returned. It was clarified that she took it in the beginning of the second day twice but at the end of the day wanted to see if she was over it all so she stopped the Tylenol. The symptoms all returned so she took again at bed time, the Tylenol, this was Saturday. On Sunday, she had diarrhea but only a couple times and though it was weird, after that is was over. That day she took Tylenol once. She was calling because she was scared about the second dose, this one produced a big immune response and she says that usually happens with the second dose. The caller wants to know if she should take the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to have this happen again or it be worse. She thought since she had already had COVID it wouldn&#39;t be as bad, her immune response. The first dose was given on 07Jan2021. It was explained the only thing unresolved was from when she had COVID, she still has a cough and no taste. There are just few thing she can taste and smell now. The patient said that all the symptoms had resolved as of Monday, the 11Jan2021. Actually, she felt pretty good on the 10Jan2021 so let&#39;s say Sunday. She explained that most people get this on the second dose and so if she going have a third response she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She was calling to get an answer to her question, the doctor told her to call to see what could be recommended. She has really good doctors, three of them. The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot. The patient said she really needs to go. No need to continue when there is no one to tell her if she should take the second shot or not. The patient asked to be contacted via email to relay information about people&#39;s immune response to the first dose verses the second dose, is it greater or less. Clinical outcome of the events recovered on 11Jan2021.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

I had joint and body aches. I experienced lightheadedness when I got up when fever was 101.8 at 2:30 pm.  I had to lay down again and apply a wet towel. Once I felt able to walk (about 10 minutes later) I ate a popsicle and then proceeded to take two 325 mg of Tylenol. Within 30 to 45 minutes fever subsided. I then ate soup, crackers and an orange and drank cranapple juice. I went back to bed and slept some more. I woke up at 5 pm and had a cup of soup, a quarter of an apple and gatorade. At 9 pm I took two more Tylenol to be safe and when to sleep. Sunday I was fine. My arm, never was swollen only a little sore.

A 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 07Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital, not a Military Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient got the Flu Vaccine last part of Sep2020 or Beginning of Oct2020. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EK57530), via an unspecified route of administration at left Upper arm on 17Dec2020 9:10AM for covid-19 immunization. She only had a sore arm. It started the same day, a couple of hours after getting the vaccine. It went away a day to a day and a half after it started. After that she was fine. She got the second dose on 07Jan2021. After the second dose, immediately, like within five minutes her arm became very sore, this event was assessed as non-serious by HCP. Also, that Thursday (07Jan2021) night after getting the second dose of the Vaccine around 9PM-10PM she started to get chills, myalgia, severe headache, and nausea. She also mentioned she was so sick during the night she was not able to get up and around. She felt like she had a temperature and by the time it was checked her temperature was 101.9. She was febrile all through 08Jan2021. She started to become afebrile 09Jan2021 with improvement and by 10Jan2021 all her symptoms had gone away and completely resolved. Seriousness Criteria: Stated she felt these are serious. She was unable to go to work on Friday. She could not return back to work until Monday. The HCP assessed all events were related to the vaccine. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021. She stated, even though she got so sick with getting the vaccine she was just continuously telling her self this is better than having COVID. She stated she even told people even if she knew after getting the shot she would have this reaction she would still take it. She has seen death occur from COVID and does not want that to happen.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, clinical course and known safety profile of the product, the reported events chills, myalgia, severe headache, nausea and fever were likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Complete muscle, joint, entire deep body. WORST i ever had. then a few welps and even though 90% was under the skin rash husband and I could feel the 10 % was red, small pimple like IF not the neck welps and then on the 4  day  had a few hives on face only.  Worst itching I have ever had and I have had chicken pox and antibiotic rashes. I think the problem has been came off of antibiotic and gradually got ok but can not get this out of system so easy of course. Today is 1 week. rash is better but not gone and itching is some better but still not good. I did not take benadryl or anything since I DO NOT want to interfere with me getting as much benefit from the injection since I now can not have number 2.

                                                I had my 2nd dose of covid vaccine on 1/15, around 5 pm.  Next day when I got up about 7:20 I felt dizzy nausea and wanted to vomit.  Then I passed out, I fell down and hit my face on the floor.  My family called 911 paramedica.  They ,measured d my blood pressure and it was too low. The area around my right eyebrow was swollen and my neck hurt as precaution I went to the hospital.  I suspect the incident and its symptom are side effects of the vaccine given the timing.  Later on I had headache off and on and brain fog.

                                                I had severe COVID and was hospitalized on Dec 7,  I was in hospital (non ICU setting) for 5 days and had O2, remdisiver and dethemethzone IV.  I recovered fully, and have felt very good since mid January.  My reaction after my 1st dose of vaccine on Feb 25  started 20 hours after shot.  Worsened through the day and I got sicker at 24-36 hours, and then stayed in bed another day.  Symptoms were identical to my bout with COVID:  chills (no fever),  nausea, aches in joints and muscles, fatigue.  They were quite significant==I could not be out of bed.  As it went along I also developed the feeling in my chest like COVID--tough to take deep breath, chest hurt---but my O2 readings were fine.   Recovered after 48 hours, People who have had COVID should be aware that they will have a significant response to the vaccine on the 1st does.  I am questioning having a second dose I have not reported this to my doctor

The pain has progressed despite range of motion exercises, ibuprofen, heat and topical steroid cream.  It has affected the use of my arm and I started myself on 30 mg of prednisone today with concern of SIRVA.  I am unable to seek any medical care at this time as I am driving my husband for cancer treatment and won&#39;t be home until Saturday the 9th of January.  I wanted to report these symptoms so if anyone else has similar symptoms it can be counted.

I passed completely out still lying in bed (so out that I wet myself in bed) and gradually came to, still feeling horrible. Got up, changed clothes, and major chills when I returned to bed. Around 6am I felt nauseous, got up to vomit, but instead passed completely out on the bathroom floor for about 15 minutes.  Remainder of day I felt very stiff, low energy and slightly woozy. By afternoon, energy was returning (I vacuumed the house). Minimal pain in arm this time compared to previous.

Post dose she experienced intermittent sensation of tingling on left posterior neck area with no paresthesia and difficulty lifting bilateral extremities.  Three days after administration of the vaccine she began noticing weakness in her legs that eventually progressed to her arms bilaterally.   She developed pitting edema and SOB.   Per infectious disease MD, the main suspicion is for GBS Guillain-Barre Syndrome given exam findings. Pt&#39;s weakness and resulting inability to ambulate may have pushed pt into CHF exacerbation.   Patient received 3 days of IVIG which was discontinued due to worsening mental status.   Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of  bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient thinks she could have COVID last Mar2020. She was not sure because her doctor&#39;s office was close for around a month and she couldn&#39;t get tested. There were no concomitant medications. On that day, 19Jan2021, after she received the vaccine she started feeling pain in the injection site, joint pain, muscle pain and fatigue. On 25Jan2021, she was feeling pretty bad, she doesn&#39;t want to eat, her back hurts, she&#39;s irritable and depressed. The patient would like to know if these side effects could be associated with the vaccine in someone who had the virus. She felt awful and she felt like she has gone right back to where she was 8 months ago, 10 months ago and started over with fatigue and everything. It was awful. She thinks she could have had COVID in Mar2020 and the symptoms she was having now, she had then and when she has had basically the whole time and that would just come back worse. There was no treatment received for the events. The outcome for the events was unknown.

                                                About 10 hours after vaccination a headache started. Then my joints started hurting almost like a nerve was firing off but only at the joints, ie knee, shoulder, toes, ankle, fingers, toes, etc. It would happen randomly. Never all joints at once. Very weird. Continued throughout the night making it difficult to sleep. In the morning, at 7 am, got up out of bed. Took 2 Advil. At 10:20 I  still have the joint happening but not as frequent and not as strong. I still have the headache. It hasn&#39;t changed.

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

                                                I had injection site discomfort, about 4-6 hours after vaccination. I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

The patient has a second vaccination appointment scheduled on 13Feb2021 and would like to know if she will still go as scheduled or will she need to go in a later date.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: L9261) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 27Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Sjogren&#39;s syndrome from 2015 (sees her Rheumatologist/ do blood work once a year to make sure her inflammation levels are okay), ongoing rosacea; dry eye syndrome (related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome); spasming, burning and twitching (last 2 medications she was on in November and January she had similar type reactions in her muscles); arthritis flareup from Oct2019 (in her left leg, she saw her neurologist who did tests and they came back normal) and sinus infection in 2020. Ongoing concomitant medication included ciclosporin (RESTASIS) for Sjogren&#39;s syndrome, ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) for blood test: deficient and ascorbic acid, betacarotene, cupric oxide, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION) for dry eye syndrome related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient previously took prednisone from Nov2020 and experienced weirdness in her legs got strong enough to keep her up at night and bad flare up for her leg symptoms; metronidazole for flare up or Rosacea (0.75% as needed, which she has used daily for last few weeks), meloxicam in Nov2020 and pantoprazole in Jan2021 and had bad flare up for her leg symptoms (symptoms subsided as soon as she stopped taking the medication after about 5 days); ibuprofen, acetaminophen and pepcid for her stomach. She had the vaccine, her first dose, on 27Jan2021, about a week ago. The first two days she didn&#39;t notice anything and then she had weird sensations in her legs on 28Jan2021. The second night she had a weird sensation in her legs which was similar to what she had experienced with the two medications she took in November and January. On 30Jan2021 the sensations spread through her body, she describes these sensations as twitching, burning, cramping, and tingling. She clarifies the sensations moved to her arms which did not happen with the other medications that she tried in November and January. Monday night, 01Feb2021, she was up all night and couldn&#39;t sleep and says she called the family doctor yesterday and he called in a prescription for Gabapentin 100 mg. She said she took the medication last night and she did sleep last night, but she was unsure if it was from exhaustion from the last few nights from not sleeping or the medicine, but she did sleep better and her symptoms were a lot less last night. Patient said she wanted to report this and that her concern is with the second dose; will she have a worse reaction, is there anything she can do or take and should she be concerned about it. She said the events gradually increased, they started mildly and then became significant. She felt the sensations a little bit in the day time but they start big time in the night when laying down. These sensations experienced in her legs started the second night, 28Jan2021, and then spread to her arms in the last couple of days which had not happened with her other incidences (with the medications mentioned above back in November and January). Clarified that the sensations spread to her arms on 29Jan2021, but the worst nights were 31Jan2021 and 01Feb2021. She said they were bad nights. She said in regard to her sleeping, starting on 29Jan2021, she was restless, she had trouble getting sleep and trouble getting in a comfortable position. She woke up frequently. Saturday the sleeping was a little worse, but she did sleep. She said on Sunday, 31Jan2021, and Monday, 01Feb2021, she hardly got any sleep. The sensations spread to her arms and it probably started a little on Saturday night, but Sunday and Monday it was very noticeable. She started Gabapentin; it was one a day before bed. The leg symptoms were still there last night. The sensations in her arms were not much at all. She did get up once with the leg cramp and was feeling tightness in her left leg but it never went into a cramp. The cramp was in her right leg, which was unusual because it was usually in her left leg. She stated she was unsure if her symptoms were starting to subside or if the Gabapentin had an immediate effect. The events did not require a visit to physician or ER. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Had all of the side effects, chills, fever, muscle aches, joint pain and a wicked headache. Monday was the same minus the headache. Today, still have joint pain and feel very weak. The nurse that gave us our vaccinations said that if we experienced any of the side effects, we should let our primary physician know.  Hopefully all of this is normal and I will be back to my normal self soon. I am concerned because most of the information I have read says 24 hours and effects should be gone. Not so with me. Hope all is well with you and your family.  &#34;  Spoke w/ pt on phone and she stated her s/s are subsiding, other than the arthralgia, RN

She then had a rash that started on the left side of her neck, went towards the back now.  This started a few days after the vaccine, all on the left side.  She also got a cold sore on her lip which she had all the time as a child, but not as an adult, which has pretty much resolved.  She has been cold, chills and some dizzy spells.  She did get a bump on her head concussion in December.  One day last week she just stayed on the sofa with a blanket due to feeling poorly.  3 days ago on her back by her shoulder blade an area has been really sore.  She did take some Tylenol for the back pain which did not help so she stopped this.   She did not call her doctor.    The rash is still there but not as intense.  It has not itched, but she has felt it.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 11:30 at single dose (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization.

The nurse practitioner at the doctor&#39;s office was wondering if it could have been an interaction between the Medrol pack and the vaccine. She got an email saying she could get the vaccine, but didn&#39;t think to call the doctor office to ask about the Medrol pack (steroid pack) or if it could cause any interactions. So the office told her to call. Later mentions along with the Medrol pack, she got an injection in the office of Toradol and this was before getting the vaccine.

The patient had no Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The patient had no events following prior vaccinations.

Both sides of my neck turned pink as though I had a sunburn. Broke out in profuse sweating.  Called my doctor who was on call that night. He told me to get Benadryl  right away and to keep taking it until symptoms subsided. If they did not subside or got worse I was to go to urgent care, or ER. Treatment: Benadryl every 4-6 hours for 2 days. As each dose wore off I waited to see if the symptoms came back and then took more Benadryl. Issue lasted until Saturday night - 2 days.

A 66-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included DM type 2, hypertension (HTN), fibromyalgia, chronic asthma, Covid prior vaccination, No Allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Other vaccine same date included other vaccine same date product was Pfizer, other vaccine same date vaccine date 05Jan2021. On 06Jan2021, the patient experienced Body chills, fever that went up to 100.4 degrees F., bone pain 10/10, muscle pain 8/10, fatigue and excess mucus. No treatment received for the adverse events Body chills, fever that went up to 100.4 degrees F., bone pain 10/10, muscle pain 8/10, fatigue and excess mucus. The events were non-serious per the reporter. Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient hadn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events Body chills, fever that went up to 100.4 degrees F., bone pain 10/10, muscle pain 8/10, fatigue and excess mucus was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about Lot/Batch cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of bone and muscle pain cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Cholesterol and Blood pressure, patient stated she took low dose medication for her blood cholesterol and blood pressure, but has had no new medications. She had a history of some allergies: a slight shrimp and scallops allergy, possible peanuts, penicillin, and a Neomycin product. She said they were not a big deal, and she had environmental allergies as well. She had an allergic reaction to the eye drop Neomycin, possibly, just the eye drop, she had a little breakout around her lips but she didn&#39;t know if it was the drug or not. The allergy to shrimp and scallops showed up in a blood test, her reaction to peanuts around her mouth but she had a negative scratch test and blood test for allergy to peanuts. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient stated she did get the flu vaccine, that was ok, she was fine, this was probably around Nov2020 or so, though she didn&#39;t know off hand when she got it, it was the regular flu vaccine and not an increased dose. The patient experienced arm discomfort on 17Jan2021, itching to eyes, mouth, and throat an hour after vaccination on 17Jan2021 12:00. The patient took the first shot yesterday (17Jan2021) and she had some discomfort to her arm, but it didn&#39;t bother her. She got the shot about 11:00 yesterday (17Jan2021) and about an hour after the shot she had some itching to her eyes, mouth, and throat that was not severe then was on and off through the day. She would like to know if this is common, she would like the information for the second dose, if she should expect more or less or same, she was concerned about the second dose. She did not have a severe reaction, she just wanted to make sure there weren&#39;t any adverse reaction for that make sure she known. She had not seen a doctor for her itching eyes, mouth, and throat. She didn&#39;t do any treatment for it, it was better today (18Jan2021), she just noticed it an hour after the injection that she felt a bit of eyes being itchy and all over, her mouth and throat were not severe, but she definitely felt it through the day. She felt it a little at night sometimes anyway like a dry throat. It was gone this morning and her arm was better, it seemed like the itching went with the arm things since following her arm soreness her itchiness started, then when her arm felt better the itchy was going away. The outcome of events was recovering.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

She took Tylenol instead, this morning. She had to go out and get some. The nurse told her when she got the second dose that she would have side effects and she would feel it. Her arm was sore so she circled it around. She went this morning to the pharmacy to get the Tylenol. She is unsure if because she was moving around, or because of the Tylenol that she feels so much better. Maybe like she could even go into work at Noon. She did not take Advil or Tylenol last night, which maybe that is why she was sore. The chills only lasted about half an hour last night and 15 minutes today. Body aches had greatly improved. It is mostly in her arm and her knees are a little achy. They are normally not. She is 85% better. It is going away as we speak.

Yesterday (20Jan2021) she noticed, she had really bad arthritis like she has had a knee replacement and she has it her hands and yesterday she noticed her wrist was swollen and she didn&#39;t know if it could have been where she had arthritis or could it be side effect? She just didn&#39;t know if she should call her orthopedic doctor. She said the joint at the wrist, it was like the side of her hand, it was the side where your pinky was, just above the bone on her wrist it was swollen. It was swollen normally but it usually didn&#39;t hurt like this, it was like a burning but it maybe her arthritis acting up but she did not know. She said the pain and swelling began yesterday 20Jan2021. Her wrist was swollen and it was like a burning was reported as worsened. She had a little pain in her leg the other day on 17Jan2021 but just coughed it up. It was all on the left side which was the same side she got the injection on. She didn&#39;t think anything of the leg pain and it went away. The pain in her leg has resolved completely. The only other thing was her arthritis was really bad, it just seemed that it just flared up but she was wondering if it could be a side effect. The events didn&#39;t require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of &#34;She had a little pain in her leg&#34; was recovered in Jan2021, while outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                She started itching on 2/18/21 and bumps started on her legs, itching. It then spread to her knees, legs, side, arm and her back. It came and then it went away, then it came back again twice that day.  Each day it would come and go and would leave hives on her body. She took Benadryl and then started having ankle issues, and then a ball formed on the bottom of both feet, which lasted for several hours and went away. She went to the hospital yesterday 2/23/21 and broke out into hives again and then went to the hospital as her PCP did not have an opening. They told her that they had had some report of people breaking out with hives, and told her to not to get hot, keep the house on a cool temperature. He prescribed Prednisone and Pepcid and to continue with the Benadryl and suggested to not to take the 2nd shot. She called the help desk to see if it was okay to take the Prednisone and answered her questions and told her there was no indication that she could not take it. The symptoms still come and go with the hives and itching.

(Had  arm pain and mild chills and fatigue).  The day after dose two above noted fullness and discomfort in feet, On the second day after, had  early erythematous (non-puritic) rash, mild multi-joint discomfort, 100 deg fever, and shaking chills. Doctor on call said to use judgment on starting Prednisone, since hope that this would stabilize.  However, progressed and at 9am on the third day after vaccine started prednisone 40mg.  At the worst, had to be dressed by husband due to pain and stiffness in upper extremities, widespread erythematous rash, fullness of skin, joint swelling.

                                                seizures; muscle fatigue; hives; rash from head to toe; sore muscles; wrap around headache; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable healthcare professional (patient herself). A 66 -year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. She provided a brief history from 2017. She was walking her dog and she fell and suffered a concussion, she had a seizure, then she developed bipolar disorder. She&#39;s been taking sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) for her seizures since 2017. She reports she&#39;s very active. She&#39;s not an old lady. She can run circles around some 22 year old&#39;s. In September of 2017, she had a concussion and had seizures. She&#39;s been on sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) since that time. She&#39;s not mentally ill, the concussion she got in 2017 caused her brain to turn bipolar. It&#39;s hard for people to understand that. Sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) was 500mg. She takes 1 tablet in the morning and 2 tablets at night because it can make you sleepy. She reports she was recently hospitalized in Feb2021 for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (RVR). Her heartrate was 181 beats per minute, her blood pressure was dropping, she tested positive for rhinovirus and the doctor thinks the atrial fibrillation with RVR was caused from the rhinovirus. She was allergic to bee venom and carries an EPI PEN. Medical history also included ongoing high blood pressure from an unspecified date (controlled with medication). Concomitant medications included ongoing metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR) taken for blood pressure; ongoing lisinopril; ongoing valproate semisodium (DEPAKOTE) taken for seizure from 2017; ongoing hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril (LISINOPRIL HCTZ) taken for blood pressure; paracetamol (TYLENOL) from an unspecified date in 2021. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9810; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021). The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions or any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported; or any other vaccines around the time of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The patient reported that with the second Covid 19 vaccine she had two seizures on 27Mar2021. The seizures were back to back. The seizures resolved within 2 minutes. She had fatigue from an unspecified date, sore muscles and a wrap around headache on 26Mar2021. The wrap around headache felt like she was going to have a stroke even though her blood pressure was fine. She monitored her blood pressure at her home. She feels it&#39;s weird that they publish that the second Covid 19 vaccine is going to be worse. She thought she&#39;d have muscle soreness and fatigue but not seizures. She looked it up and the wrap around headache and seizure are the rarest things that can happen after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She stayed in bed from Friday afternoon after she received the second Covid 19 vaccine on 26Mar2021 and started to feel better Sunday afternoon, 28Mar2021. Her blood pressure and pulse were both fine with her wrap around headache. She had fatigue with both Covid 19 vaccines. She also developed hives, which she still has. She has a rash from her head to her toes. It looked like she rolled around in an ant bed. The hives were clearing up. She was using an anti-itch cream. The hives and the rash started midday on Saturday, 27Mar2021. She only has around 5 hives now on her chest. She hasn&#39;t taken Benadryl. She doesn&#39;t like to take it. Her doctor didn&#39;t want her to open the hives and cause impetigo. She never had any soreness in her arm. She doesn&#39;t think the headache was serious because she had a blood pressure cuff at home. She just knew the hives and the rash were a reaction to the Covid 19 vaccine. She didn&#39;t go to the hospital for her seizures. She was not seen in the Emergency Department, hospitalized, or admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. She tries to do holistic medicines and treatments. She doesn&#39;t run to the hospital every time something happens. She tries to stay out of the hospital. She&#39;s fine now and she loves Pfizer. If she can get a medicine she needs that Pfizer makes she tries to get it. She tries to see every side of things. Outcome of seizures was recovered on 27Mar2021 and sore muscles was recovered on 28Mar2021; of remaining events was recovering.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and seizure cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and treprostinil sodium (TYVASO), via resp inhalation from Feb2021 to an unspecified date, at 18-54mug (3-9 breaths), 4x/day for secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension. Medical history included ongoing secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension, ongoing arthralgia, ongoing myalgia, seasonal allergy, and hypertension from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included sildenafil citrate taken for an unspecified indication; and amlodipine besilate taken for hypertension. The patient previously took meloxicam for joint pain. On an unspecified date in 2021, the patient experienced joint and muscle pain that are worse, rheumatoid arthritis and seasonal allergies. The patient had joint and muscle pain for a while, but was worse since starting treprostinil sodium. The event of rheumatoid arthritis was considered as medically significant. The patient had joint and muscle issues (arthralgia, myalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis) that could be debilitating, reported that they were getting better with the Nabumetone. On 29Mar2021, the patient had nasal stuffiness that started when she went on an outing. She felt like she was doing better this week than last week (at time of report). On 31Mar2021, the patient reported that she was having a reaction or allergies. She received her first COVID vaccine on 29Mar2021 and felt fine but woke up on Tuesday (30Mar2021) with stuffy head, nose began to run, and began to sneeze. The action taken in response to the events for treprostinil sodium was unknown. The outcome of the events arthralgia and myalgia was recovering, for rheumatoid arthritis was not recovered, and for other events was unknown.  The reporter&#39;s causality for the event of myalgia and arthralgia with IH Tyvaso was considered to be possibly related. The reporter did not provide causality for the events of rheumatoid arthritis and seasonal allergy.  Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse event of drug hypersensitivity and rheumatoid arthritis as not related to IH treprostinil and TD-300/A device. Drug hypersensitivity was likely due to administration of COVID vaccine. Rheumatoid arthritis was likely an underlying medical condition in this 66-year-old patient based on an implausible time to onset for the reported event.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 17Mar2021 at 11:30 AM (at the age of 66 years old) (Lot Number: EN6205, unknown expiration) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing anxiety (40 years or more), ongoing depression (46 years ago, at the age of 20), ongoing acid reflux (maybe 25 years), ongoing GERD (maybe 25 years), ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus (for 12 years), mild to moderate COPD since 2011, gastric bypass (a year and a half ago), and lost 120 pounds. Concomitant medications included bupropion for anxiety depression and omeprazole for acid reflux, both ongoing.  The patient previously received flu and tetanus on unspecified dates for immunization and both experienced hard red welt on arm (welt was hard and lasted for 5-7 days). The patient reported no side effects for 12 hours, but a little soreness at injection site on 17Mar2021 at 20:00 (8:00 PM). Her arm wasn&#39;t heavy, but she had an awareness of the soreness.  She has had life-long anxiety and depression. Several weeks ago (on 26Mar2021), her anxiety reared up, and it could have been due to a family situation. On the 9th day after the first shot, she was having a therapy appointment on the phone and talking about her anxiety, and she got a stiff neck, like an iron claw (26Mar2021 at 10:00 am). It lasted for a couple of 5 minutes and she laid down on the couch then on the floor.  Her therapist said to call 911. Emergency medical technicians came to her house and they said all of her numbers looked good.  She went to the hospital, and was in the emergency room for several hours, but she only remembers one hour of it.  She also had diarrhea and nausea on 26Mar2021 at 11:30, and it felt like Dumping Syndrome, that one can have from a gastric bypass. She was only aware for one hour at that point and blacked out (on 26Mar2021). With regards to nausea, she mostly saw bile in the bag, all she had that day was a protein drink. She was back home and the next day, she did not remember how she got home. She hasn&#39;t had blackouts anymore but feels it may be from heightened anxiety.  On 27Mar2021 at 09:00, she had no appetite, lost 6 pounds in a week, and was tired. She had headache lasted for days and days on 29Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. She is slowly improving but she still doesn&#39;t sleep through the night on 29Mar2021 at 16:00. It was like a feeling like she was resetting her surgery, like she didn&#39;t care about eating.  The also experienced back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica on 31Mar2021 at 16:00 and was constipated. She is using a stool softener and is back in her routine. She called her primary doctor and could not tell her what happened, and she went in a loop trying to get information and authorizations for her to make a determination of what had happened.  Her doctor felt like she should have an MRI. Her heart and all of her numbers looked good, as the emergency medical technicians said. Her primary doctor recommended her to get the second shot.  She had cancelled the second shot for this week, and she has rescheduled it for another date.  She was afraid that she will black out again, after the next vaccine, and is not sure if that is how her anxiety manifested. The main reasons she is calling is that she had no concerns of side effects prior to the vaccine, and a couple of her neighbors said they had read about side effects of the vaccine, but she was not worried.  When the patient started to read about side effects of the vaccine, she understood that on the 10th day, the vaccine starts to be in a person&#39;s system and that maybe is why she didn&#39;t have initial side effects, but then she had side effects several days later because the vaccine was in her body.  By day 10, the vaccine is in effect in the body and she is nervous. Her second vaccine is scheduled on 26Apr2021. The patient would like to know if there is any information on people that have had a gastric bypass. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The events resulted in emergency room visit (except nervous). The patient recovered from soreness at injection site on 18Mar2021; recovered from diarrhea, nausea,  felt like Dumping Syndrome on 26Mar2021; recovered from stiff neck on 26Mar2021 at 10:05am; recovered from constipation on 02Apr2021; and recovered from no appetite and lost 6 pounds on unspecified dates. The patient also recovered from headache with sequelae on unspecified date; and recovered from blacked out on 27Mar2021 with sequelae. The patient had not yet recovered from anxiety reared up; tired; doesn&#39;t sleep through the night; back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 67-year-old non-pregnant female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular in the right arm in Dec2020 04:30 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital. Medical history included gastric distress from cow milk products, and allergies to statins, dust/ dust mites. Concomitant medications included loratadine, boswellia serrata (BOSWELLIA), famotidine (PEPCID), and vitamin C. The patient did not received other vaccine within four weeks of COVID vaccine. The patient previously took ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and experienced allergies. The patient has not been diagnosed of COVID prior vaccination and has not been tested for COVID post vaccination. It was reported that on 23Dec2020 20:00, 54 hours after injection, the patient had severe joint pains (including to touch) lasting overnight. The event was partially improved with Tylenol, loratadine, Benadryl, boswellia; and subsided next day. Outcome of the event was reported as recovering. The event was assessed as non-serious.

Night 4 woke 2 am with more intense discomfort left knee, again not like anything experienced before but did not require Tylenol. It was gnawing and annoying, Night 5 woke around 4 am with left lower leg/ side of foot mild ache which lasted a few hours. Stretching, changing positions had no effect on any of three nights.  Day after vaccine while exercising I perspired more than usual and was tired. Did not concern me in any way and would not have reported unless had above symptoms.  Question- Do any of the above symptoms indicate I should not get dose 2?  Thank you

                                                3 days following vaccine, experienced tenderness and discoloration in left hand. With it was tenderness in my hand and wrist, by the 3rd day, I woke with throbbing pain in my knuckle joint with swelling and redness. Since then, the swelling and pain has progressed to additional knuckles in my left hand and into my right hand. There has also been joint pain in my left shoulder that resolved. Yesterday my right knee began to hurt. I&#39;ve used ice packs and alternated between  ibuprofen and acetaminophen for the pain. The swelling has somewhat improved but has not resolved. The pain is still present. I&#39;ve had occasional join pain before but nothing like this and it has always  resolved. Not sure if this has anything  to do with the vaccine, but since joint pain was listed as a side effect, I thought I should report it. Have not contacted my physician yet.

                                                On Christmas day I was working and then you started feeling like a pinching in my chest, like when you are going to catch a cold, that went on through the afternoon. In the afternoon I started with light headache and dry cough (intermittent), no temperature. I did not take anything for it and continued working. When I got home, I felt weak and was supposed to join my family for Christmas and decided not to go. And went to sleep. The next day (Sat) I was still not feeling well, weakness on my limbs, I went to the hospital to see if I could get checked and they told me to return on Monday because Occupational Health was closed on the weekends. I went home and treated myself with Tylenol and Vitamin C. On Monday I got tested and was positive. By then, I was coughing, limbs weak, had temperature (101F).  I started to get weaker an weaker and Tuesday or Wednesday my work called me and asked me if I would like to come see a doctor. Wednesday I started with shortness of breath. I called my PCP and he prescribed me an albuterol inhaler. It helped me but my cough got worse by Saturday. My doctor then told me to go to the hospital (I live by myself).  At my choice I went to Medical Center and were admitted and was hospitalized for 6 days.  They kept treating me with inhaler and oxygen. They wanted to send me to rehab but I told them I wanted to go home. I came home with oxygen and with albuterol inhaler and the ambulance had to bring me home. I still was feeling very weak, had cough, and had the shortness of breath. And I have been home since then. I have home health and a therapist that come check on me 2X a weekly.

                                                Yesterday I received my 2nd Pfizer vaccine at 9AM. My first dose was a non-event. About 50 minutes after the jab, I broke out in hives on my upper thigh and stomach. By 7 PM, I felt really sick, my arm felt as though the strongest person in the world punched me, and by 8, I was shivering and wrapped in a ton of  blankets, by 10, every muscle in my body ached beyond its capacity and my fever was 101.8.  It got to 102.1. My head was weighed down with an unrelenting headache. Finally, an hour ago, my fever broke. I have Systemic Lupus and CRPS and do not vaccinate because my body is always attacking itself. But this year I got my first ever flu vaccine. Same results. So sick.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.

That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pretty severe headache; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between generalized aching, severe headache, feel dizzy, going to faint, vision blurred, no energy  been very tired, very cold, her skin was very cold, wheezing and bnt162b2 vaccine cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association. The Company considers the reported event fibromyalgia flare up is unrelated to bnt162b2 vaccine but more likely due to underlying medical history of ongoing fibromyalgia.

What in the world is going on with this vaccine that it would cause those severe symptoms and my chest is still tight I still feel low congestion having hard time taking a deep breath in Mar2021&#34;. The outcome of the event &#34;my symptoms were so severe I felt like I was going to die I mean literally die&#34; was recovered on unspecified date. The outcome of the event unable to eat was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was recovering.  Information on lot/ batch number has been requested.

Day 5 paresthesia and numbness on waking up on left side, increased in intensity during the day.  Difficulty walking and using left side.  Muscle control lacking and balance very poor. The intensity of this fluctuates--there are days that improvement seems to be happening and then very bad days. Admitted to the hospital on Wednesday, March 24, 2021, via the ER.  MRI, CAT scan, heart monitor, --these did not show evidence of a stroke as suspected at the time. The neurological symptoms persist, at times including numbing on the left side of my face.

A 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6200), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Mar2021 11:45, single dose as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lung transplant from May2011, immunodeficiency from May2011 and ongoing, strokes. The patient had dtap vaccine before Jan2021. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); prednisone acetate (PREDNISONE); tacrolimus monohydrate (TACROLIMUS). Patient reported that it has been about a week and a half of maybe more since her first COVID vaccine and she gets new symptoms almost everyday. Most of the symptoms aren&#39;t like put-you-down sick, horrible symptoms, they can be dealt with, but she has had a lot of them. She never got injection site pain and her arm never got sore. She had tiredness on the second day after her COVID vaccine, she slept for almost two days. She has a headache almost constantly. She is having muscle pain or some kind of pain, maybe joint pain that is in her hips. She doesn&#39;t have chills, a fever, injection site swelling or redness. She has had nausea and she has generally felt unwell all the time for a week and a half now. She is immunocompromised because she has had a lung transplant, that is the one thing that probably sets her apart is that she is immunosuppressed. She had the lung transplant almost 10 years ago now and she has been doing well. She is not on blood thinner medicine but she does take a baby aspirin everyday. Those are the only two things that she can think about. She doesn&#39;t know if all of that would make the symptoms from the COVID vaccine different for her. Most people she knows who have received the COVID vaccine have only had a couple days of tiredness and a sore arm. But she has a headache, been achy, and she just doesn&#39;t feel good. She also had a headache then and slept a lot, she was really tired. Later in the report caller clarified the first dose was actually 09Mar2021. She is not tired right now but she does still have a headache today, it is a pretty good headache. Her tiredness was Sunday and Monday of this week, confirmed to be 14Mar2021 and 15Mar2021. She says that she has recovered completely from the tiredness even though she feels like she could nap right now but she can&#39;t since she has a blood draw later. It is like she wakes up and every day she gets new symptoms. She had two symptoms that are not on the sheet of symptoms. The two she experienced are weird. On Saturday, a week and a day after her vaccine, her eyes were yellow when she woke up that morning. Confirmed date to be 13Mar2021. It was only that one day. She thinks that she has recovered completely. Also, her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes. Some of this is normal in the winter for her, but the yellow isn&#39;t normal for her. Normally, when she does get the blood vessels in her eyes they will heal in a day or so but the ones now have lasted much longer. They have been much slower to go away. It is not like there is a red spot, but it looks kind of red and kind of weird. The other symptom that is strange is that her platelet levels dropped. She was at 49 before her COVID vaccine and now her platelet level is down to 29. She does have normally very low levels for platelets but they are usually around 50. They have dropped substantially since her COVID vaccine. They dropped from 50 to 33 and then 5 days later her level went to 29. She is getting another platelet level drawn today, confirmed to be 16Mar2021. Her eyes being sore, red, and having broken blood vessels occurred probably a couple of days after she received the COVID vaccine. Specifically, her left eye felt like it had something in but she doesn&#39;t believe that it did. She used eye drops. Her eye just felt gritty. This is not like she had pink eye and she didn&#39;t wake up with this eye shut. It wasn&#39;t pink eye she knows what that is like. Her eyes had broken blood vessels and then they turned yellow then they turned red and have remained red. They are not sore today and she doesn&#39;t feel like she has gravel in her eye but the whites of her eyes don&#39;t really look clear. She says so far it has improved some but she will see since she wakes up every day and something new has happened, or something different or something has come back again. The good news is that she doesn&#39;t have all of these symptoms at the same time. She can&#39;t the remember the day pain in hips began but it is ongoing. She noticed this morning that the pain in her hip was not as bad when she had gotten out of bed. That pain has lessened there but the pain went to her head. Nausea and generally not feeling well: Probed for when this began and caller says that it has occurred for several days after she eats dinner, her stomach will be growling loud and that comes along with abdominal pain which doesn&#39;t really fit in with muscle or joint pain, she has no muscle there unfortunately she jokingly says. Sometimes this is all accompanied with diarrhea. It is not ongoing as of now, no date provided. She noticed that it comes and goes and sometimes she can eat and she is fine and sometimes she gets really sick feeling. It seems like if she doesn&#39;t eat then she doesn&#39;t get the symptoms but she knows that she needs to eat. Investigations: Her doctor has been having her do platelet blood tests about every 5 days since she took the COVID vaccine. She does not remember the dates of these tests off of the top of her head. She had a blood draw at the clinic the day before her COVID vaccine and her platelet count was 49 on 08Mar2021. For the result of 29 that was either last Thursday or last Friday, 11Mar2021 or 12Mar2021. Te outcome of the event scleral discoloration was recovered on 13Mar2021, tiredness was recovered on 15Mar2021, headache was not recovered, pain in hip was recovering, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021299104 similar report from same reporter

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 02Mar2021 14:00 (Lot Number: EN6203) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously had first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9809) on 09Feb2021 in the bicep left arm upper muscle for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included surgery from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included vitamin D3 taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient previously took Miralax. The patient previously had first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9809) on 09Feb2021 in the bicep left arm upper muscle for COVID-19 immunization and Pneumonia shot and never had swelling. The patient had rosy arm pits red rash and sometimes get a reaction in ears, if it flares up and gets hot. The patient stated, &#34;For 5 weeks I&#39;ve been taking children&#39;s Benadryl. I had a quicker reaction with the second dose than I did the first one but I still had some lingering effects from the first dose when I got the second. How long do these side effects usually last?&#34; The patient had second COVID 19 vaccine and also had first one. The first dose was on 09Feb21 and she had swelling in arm after shot and has been using a cool cloth on it and was better by the next day. The patient still feels it though and it has been five weeks. The patient tries to turn arm and can still feel it but it was not bad. A day later she had her first skin reaction which was a red rash under both armpits. The patient waited because she wanted to see what reactions she would have with second dose. The reaction from first dose happened for three weeks. The patient has been taking liquid Benadryl everyday sometimes during night and also cold wet compresses in armpits has helped with inflammation. The primary care doctor and talked to the patient to see if she should try some other medication before second shot and the nurse recommended she should not get second shot that she should see an allergist. The patient got second shot and talked to nurse there. The nurse told the patient she would have to come back at least four days after the second shot was due or it would not work together. The patient went ahead and got the vaccine and it has not been life threatening as of now. The patient saw an allergist three days after second shot. The patient had rosy red inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly bilateral armpit and then sometimes ears would get hot. The patient would take Benadryl. The physician told the patient to try to take Allegra 24 hours but the patient stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours. The patient took the Allegra medication on Sunday morning and that it worked for her for about 12 hours and she knew she could not take any more Allegra but the Benadryl seemed to help. The allergist felt she made the right decision since her events are not life-threatening since it is not respiratory. The allergist saw her armpits agreed the children Benadryl was working and that she should stick with that. The patient stated, it is not going away been like this the whole time since 02Mar2021 and still having a reaction in her armpits. The patient stated after the second shot the flare up was quicker because first shot was already in system still. It was not a flare up like when someone can not eat seafood and stuff like that. The patient still has a rosy armpit. The patient has not seen her doctor since last year when she had a physical. The patient would inform her doctor about these events. The patient stated she is really blossoming under the armpits and they are rosy red but no blisters and her skin is dry from being inflamed all this time. She squeezes a rag under her armpits and that it is better during the day than at night, it is worse at night. The patient was only taking 20 mL of Benadryl in the morning and then evening before bed. The patient stated, &#34;the first shot right at the beginning she had to take Benadryl in the middle of the night as well but got to where she was taking it 12 hours apart before second dose.&#34; The patient hopes she is not having to walk around with compresses in the summer as it is easier when it is cold and that she hopes this fazes. The patient was noticing since she had not taken a shower or hot bath this morning that she had rosy red cheeks like a rosy red U on her face. The second shot she asked the nurse to give in her back upper part of bicep in arm muscle since it was a better location and it did not swell up and it did not hurt. Caller stated the nurse the first time gave the shot like when you see people getting shots on tv they put it really high up in muscle. The patient considered the event as medically significant and that it is ongoing and has worsened. The hurt was always in the center of armpit not in the armpit. The past couple of days her skin has been dry. She has used hand cream but is afraid to put anything else on it because of reaction. Just annoying. The patient will probably put cream on it so it does not crack, it is very dry and it has not been dry like this. The patient has been putting water on at night which could have dried it out. Some days is worse than others more red. This is persisting. Soreness in arm happened right after first shot. The shot was given in the proper way but seemed like more of a reaction. The second shot is much better and that she does not feel it at all. The patient can still feel where the vaccine went in left arm. It was annoying but it does not keep her from moving her arm and it has been five weeks. Since it is not going away it is serious. The patient was not taking Benadryl in middle of day like before but it is itchy so she is going to go out in the cold and work in yard. Before first week or two she would use cool compresses all day and take Benadryl during day and then at night it petered out. The patient was hoping it will fade out eventually. The patient did not want to double up on Allegra as she is not sure what the reaction would be. The medical ingredient was Fexofenadine HCL 180mg antihistamine. The patient only took one pill as it did not work. 24 hour Allegra, 180mg antihistamine 15 tablets per box. The patient was taking Children Benadryl 20mL and would take at least every 6 six hours and was trying to hold off to now taking it 12 hours and will use cold compress if she has to. The patient usually takes Zyrtec for seasonal allergies like dust. She took no Zyrtec at all for either shots. She felt the Benadryl worked better and quicker. The patient was at the Allergist she asked what is in this vaccine like what chemical. She looked up the ingredients but did not understand. Her friend told her Polyethylene glycol was in both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine. The patient had rosy red, inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly her bilateral armpits and then sometimes ears would get hot. The patient stated her primary care physician told her to try to take Allegra 24 hours but caller stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours. The patient stated she took the Allegra medication on Sunday morning and that it worked for about 12 hours and she knew she could not take any more Allegra. The patient stated the medical ingredient was Fexofenadine HCL 180mg antihistamine. The patient stated she only took one pill as it did not work. Sample of the product was available to be returned. The packaging was sealed and intact. The outcome of the event &#34;Ears would get warm feeling very hot&#34; and &#34;after the second shot the flare up was quicker&#34; was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known safety profile, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of events rash and erythematous rash (allergy context) cannot be excluded.

I say I was fine until 3-4 hours later, I had extreme headaches. At 430pm, I still had the headaches and I took Tylenol 500mg. At night my headache got worse and it felt like I had the flu. I then went to bed and when I woke up my left arm felt intense like hornets and it was swollen. I then took another Tylenol and Ibuprofen 600mg. At 4am, I felt awful and horrible. I had joint pain with aches, felt nauseated. I called my PCP and he told me to take Prednisone 10mg. My fever was 101.4F. By the night my fever was gradually coming down and it was 102F. By the next day I felt much better.  I also had Covid-19 on March 2020 and also got tested for antibody test in July 2020.  I spoke with my PCP and he is recommending I do not take the 2nd dose injection.

                                                Patient is a 68yo female with a PMH s/f of osteoarthritis, CHF, TIA with right limb weakness and aphasia and HTN presenting with a 1 week history of bilateral upper and lower extremity pain, stiffness and weakness. Patient states that she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/14 last week at pharmacy. At the time of inoculation, she did not experience any symptoms and went home after the 15 minute waiting period. The next day, she developed a generalized headache that started in her neck and continued over her head. She states that this continued to get worse throughout the day and on Saturday, she woke up and described a constant, 10/10, dull-aching pain that started at her neck/back of head and extended down to her shoulders to the tips of her fingers. She also stated that she had the same pain starting around her groin extending down to her knees and ankles. Patient initially tried taking Tylenol and ibuprofen to treat the pain, and said that those treatments normally work for her osteoarthritis, but that her pain did not improve afterwards.  In addition to the pain, she also states that she developed worsening weakness to the point where she could not walk around her home. She stated that she thought moving around and being active had helped her fight through the pain and tolerate it, but that laying down and resting actually seemed to make it worse.  With her symptoms worsening and her inability to walk, she decided to come to the hospital to get further treatment. She denied ever having an adverse reaction to other vaccines she has received previously. She receives the flu vaccine every year, and received measles, polio and other childhood vaccinations that she could not recall. She was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica and started on 20mg prednisone daily. She had a remarkable response to the steroids and her symptoms resolved within 24 hours. She was discharged on her 3rd day of admission.   On ROS, she denies fevers, chills, night sweats, SOB, changes to vision, eye pain, cough, chest pain, sputum production, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria or hematuria. She affirmed weight loss, headache, neck stiffness, dizziness, lightheadedness, muscle stiffness/pain, reduced ROM, and urinary urgency and incontinence.

They are trying to figure out, she has water in her ear she has had CT scans recently trying to check for any problems that could be corrected surgically and that was all clean. She has had a mammogram, she was not sure about the mammogram yet but she thinks they would have called her if there was a problem with that. Historical vaccine included Just mild stuff with the flu vaccine for immunisation on occasion she has had similar reactions that were very mild with the flu vaccine and last year she had none of that at all. She says when she has had any other vaccine, she had no reaction other than maybe a slightly sore arm. No other products. She did have some mild side effects. She was really glad she got this shot. She said she had experienced some chilling on 13Jan2021, these are all very mild symptoms. She had a sore throat on 13Jan2021, some aching, like body aches on 13Jan2021 and joint tenderness on 13Jan2021. She just got chilled every once in a while. It was not very bad. She said the sore throat had persisted about the same, but the coffee helped. She was having some swelling at the injection site that was about the same as when it began on 13Jan2021. She was having some arm tenderness on 13Jan2021. She did not have any adverse reactions yesterday (12Jan2021) she was so excited to get it. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 11Jan2021 5:15 PM at a single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing shellfish allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing iodine allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing Mitral valve prolapse (for 20 years), blood pressure high, and cholesterol. The patient had mitral valve prolapse for about 20 years now. They are just watching it now. She just saw the cardiologist, and had an echo done. If the symptoms worsen, they will proceed. Concomitant medications included diltiazem for blood pressure high and atorvastatin for cholesterol, both from an unspecified date and ongoing; she has been on these medications for 30 years now. On 11Jan2021, the patient experienced facial tingling, immediate pain in arm from injection, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all, left eye twitching, chills, nausea, no appetite, whole body ache, tired, whole body trembled, nervous. On 12Jan2021, the patient experienced back pain. The patient explained that on 11Jan2021, evening at 5:15pm, she received her first COVID 19 vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine was being given out at that time. She has shellfish and iodine allergies. So, they made her sit and wait 30 minutes after being injected. One of her daughters took her. On the drive home, a few minutes after leaving she developed facial tingling. At first, she thought nothing of it. She did have immediate pain in her arm from the injection. By the time she got home, she couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all. It was that painful. The next morning, she couldn&#39;t lift arm, and if she tried, she would be in pain. Also, her left eye started twitching right away also. That night she really noticed it. It was not a constant twitching. She thought at first it was because she was tired or from the pain in her body. But then she noticed the next day it was still doing that. It was still twitching. It is not constant, but it was here and there. She still had it on 13Jan2021, but so far nothing at the day of report (14Jan2021). She also had chills. She had on double clothes, and coverings on her feet and hands. The chills wouldn&#39;t go away. Her whole body trembled. On 13Jan2021, Wednesday morning, they went away. She experienced nausea and no appetite. Her whole body ached. It was so brutal. The problem was with her left eye. It didn&#39;t twitch constantly, but it got her nervous. She is pretty sure she is going to refuse the second dose. She has heard that the 2nd part is when most people have the worst side effects. So, she is not comfortable getting it. She also got back pain. It wasn&#39;t severe, but it was there. She is against getting the second shot. She stated that she is a medical assistant at a pediatric office. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She got it (vaccine) because of her age. She was advised to get it as she was around patients. Work gave them the option. The inability to move her arm ended in the middle of night at 4 am 14Jan 2021. She noticed she could move her arm. Her second dose is scheduled for 01Feb2021 at 8:45 am. She does work in a pediatric office. If the second part of side effects are worse, then she doesn&#39;t want to take the chance. The eye has her concerned. Outcome of the events were as follows: facial tingling recovered on 11Jan2021, immediate pain in arm from injection recovered on 13Jan2021, chills recovered on 13Jan2021, nausea recovered on 13Jan2021, no appetite recovered on 13Jan2021, whole body ache recovered on 13Jan2021, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all recovered on 14Jan2021, back pain was recovering, while outcome for events left eye twitching, tired, whole body trembled, and nervous, was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 68-year-old female (not pregnant) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 14Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), previous TIA (Transient ischemic attack) with some residual right sided weakness, CHF (congestive heart failure), osteoarthritis. Had a childhood vaccination history. No Known allergies. Concomitant medications included albuterol, aspirin, atorvastatin, fluticasone, furosemide, hydralazine, ibuprofen, lisinopril, metoprolol, multivitamin, all above were in two weeks (as of 25Jan2021). The patient previously received influenza vaccine yearly, and received her pneumonia vaccines over the last several years, both for immunization and never had a reaction to a vaccine. The patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. No other vaccine received in four weeks. The patient developed a dull headache on 15Jan2021, one date after the vaccine, but that it resolved after 24 hours on 16Jan2021. On 16Jan2021 at 8:00 AM, the patient developed bilateral proximal muscle stiffness, weakness, and pain in her upper and lower extremities over the course of 1 week. The patient started experiencing this bilateral upper and lower extremity pain, stiffness and weakness beginning at the shoulders and hips and extending distally over several days. Her symptoms started out relatively mild and progressively got worse over the course of 7 days. She presented to the reporting healthcare professional 8 days after her vaccination and she was extremely weak and could not support herself to walk around in her home, the reporting healthcare professional suspect polymyalgia rheumatica. All the events (except dull headache) resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization. The patient was hospitalization due to all the above events for 3 days. The patient had a remarkable response to the treatment of prednisone during her hospitalization. It was unknown if covid prior vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included COVID tested (COVID test type: Nasal Swab, SARS-COVID19 PCR) post vaccination on 23Jan2021: Negative. Outcome of event headache was recovered on 16Jan2021 and all the events was recovered on an unspecified date.   Information about lot/batch number was requested; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded, considering the temporal relationship.  However, it is worth noting that the 68-year-old female patient had pre-existing osteoarthritis, which could be one of the causes of joint symptoms.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 68-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration, at arm left, on 12Jan2021 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included blood cholesterol increased, chronic productive cough, known allergies to sulfa, sinus disorder.

As of 23Jan2021, it was reported the patient experienced burning, tingling sensations around ankles, knees and lower leg. Yesterday started feeling same thing, the feet, toes, around ankles, up legs and around knees. Sometime it feels like it&#39;s a mild burning radiating from around the joints and in the lower leg too. It is mainly her feet up to above the knees, burning, tingling, radiating. Sometimes have occasional pain little bit in some of the other joints, this is a little bit more than joint pain. Consumer stated, that she received the first dose of this Pfizer Vaccine on 12Jan2021. And about four days after during the night she was feeling some kind of burning, tingling sensations around ankles and knees and lower leg. It went away it lasted maybe about 4 hours, but then yesterday which is on the 22nd started in early afternoon started feeling the same thing, the feet and the toes, around ankles, up the legs and around the knees. Sometime it feels like it&#39;s a mild burning radiating from you know around the joints and in the lower leg too. It is mainly feet up to above the knees, burning, tingling, radiating. And sometimes I have occasional pain in just a little bit in some of the other joints you know that&#39;s been going on after the vaccine occasionally. The heat from the elbow (not clarified further), besides the knees and the ankle and the toes. The patient called this number because that is the number that was on the page to say if there was anything to report and then you know she was wondering if this is, she saw that some of the side effects could be joint pain but this is a little bit more than joint pain. So, she was wondering if there is anything. She mean she was going to see doctor on Monday, this has been going on for more than 30 hours now, but she was wondering if there is any advice in this. Pricking pain in her left hip started on 12Jan2021, Little bit of cramping in left foot started on 12Jan2021, Knees, ankles and feet, the lower leg felt cramp, like a radiating pain started on 16Jan2021. Consumer stated, initially, when she just got the vaccine, she felt a little prick in her left hip, like a little pain but it did not stay, pricking pain in her left hip. A little bit of cramping in her left foot, but it went away. So she did not think anything of it. 4 days later, on the 16Jan2021 (later confirmed), during the night her knees, her ankles and feet, the lower leg felt cramp, like a radiating pain. It was not very severe, like a mild pain in the knees and the lower legs and feet, a type of tingling but it went away. Pain was like a radiating, sort of burning but it was mild burn. Date when started experiencing pain is on the same day, 12Jan2021. Lab work was no. Treatment was no, because it was transient but afterwards what concerned her is on Friday which is the 22nd, she started experiencing a pain in knees, ankles and feet and lower leg with the cramping and tingling, mostly tingling and burning like a radiating pain. The whole, above her knees, down the lower leg, ankles, feet and toes and it continued up till last night and so more than for 30 hours that is what concerned her. That is why she called last night. The outcome of the event feeling hot , pain in extremity, muscle spasm was unknown, of the other events was not recovered.

A 68-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 06Jan2021 at single dose on right deltoid for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure high and seasonal allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EJ1685) on 16Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced community acquired pneumonia, shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness, fatigue, COPD, muscle aches and pains, she became ill, all on12Jan2021; arm soreness on an unspecified date. Events required Emergency Room visit. Clinical course reported as: she got the second dose of the pfizer covid vaccine on 06Jan2021 and on 12Jan2021 she experienced shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness and fatigue. Nurse stated ER doctor thought she had COPD or community acquired pneumonia. Nurse further stated she had the second COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021. A week later on 12Jan2021, she became ill. She had all the symptoms of COVID. She was short of breath, very fatigued. She couldn&#39;t get any air, she was at work. She had muscle aches and pains. The shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness lasted several days. She also had severe chest congestion. She confirmed she got better. It actually took 4 or 5 days. By that Sunday (17Jan2021) she was better. She wanted it noted she had no reaction right after the shot. She stated she only had arm soreness, it was just a little sore, not even worth mentioning. It was only when she moved her arm a certain way. This was with either vaccine (first or second vaccine). She went to the doctor and somebody thought it might be a reaction, but the nurse thought it was too late for a reaction. The ER doctor thought it was COPD and community acquired pneumonia. Her primary doctor thought it was COPD. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test: negative on 12Jan2021. Outcome of arm soreness was unknown, others was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the drug-event time interval and the vaccine&#39;s safety profile, the  community acquired pneumonia is possibly intercurrent condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162B2 administration, which is not the disease that the vaccine BNT162B2 can prevent from. While the COPD is more likely underlying condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162 injection.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot #: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 17Jan2021 at 15:00 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included benign spinal cord tumor from 1987 and unspecified if ongoing (a lot of bone had to get cut), lot of scar tissue (wonders if it is a weak spot) from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing, thyroid removed in 2015, neurosurgery (to remove the benign spinal cord tumor) on an unspecified date, thyroid on an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing and cholesterol from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing levothyroxine (strength: 125 ug) taken for an unspecified indication at 125 ug, 1x/day, ongoing pravastatin (strength: 40mg) taken for cholesterol from an unspecified date at 40mg, 1x/day and ongoing multivitamin. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient experienced lower back pain, nerve pain, excruciating pain/getting pain, muscle pain, couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and her husband had to pull her out of the bed because she felt she had no muscle activity, all on 17Jan2021. The patient called and stated &#34;she had a very extreme reaction from the first dose of the vaccine, which she had last Sunday the 17th. It began with lower back pain, which did not alarm her too much but then it went in to nerve pain. By the end of the evening, by about midnight, she was in what she considered to be excruciating pain. She changed positions and it was hitting the nerve and she was getting pain and having muscle pain. She was up all night because she could not sleep with the pain. Monday and Tuesday were very excruciating, and she took Tramadol Monday after consulting with her doctor. She did not get any relief until Wednesday, 3 days after the shot. Even today she had some lower back pain, but it is way better than it was. It was improving from Wednesday to today but Sunday to Wednesday was excruciating since it was giving her nerve pain. Her husband had to pull her out of the bed because she felt she had no muscle activity. In 1987 she had a spinal cord tumor and a lot of bone had to get cut and she stated she was sure she had a lot of scar tissue and wondered if it was a weak spot. She stated this could be an isolated incident, but she really thought she had another tumor at first until it started dissipating on its own. She stated she did not know anyone who has had this reaction and asked if it was safe/advisable to get the second shot? She stated she was afraid of the permanent nerve damage but as long as it cannot do anything permanent, she wanted to get it. Was this a reported symptom? Has anyone ever gotten paralyzed? After verbal response she stated she will talk with her doctor and maybe see a neurologist.&#34; Upon follow-up the patient called and stated &#34;I had two questions actually. I received the Pfizer Vaccine yesterday and last night I started with the excruciating back pain, my lower back. I do not know if it was coincidence or not because I have back trouble before. I did not do anything to throw my back out. However, I was told it would be okay to take Extra Strength Tylenol. I took 4 Tylenol within like 3 hours period because it was not working. I took another two this morning. Tylenol was not doing anything at all for the pain relief. My question was, I have a prescription of Tramadol which I took for pain for different reason, but I have it. First of all, I hope by taking the Tylenol yesterday that it did not interfere with the efficiency of the vaccine. My other question is can I take the Tramadol now? Since the vaccine was 24 hours ago would it interfere with efficiency?&#34; Upon follow-up the patient called to report that &#34;she went to her chiropractor late Wednesday afternoon, and he did some stretching, but her spine was not out of alignment, so he felt her pain was due to the vaccine. Stated that it was not until her back started getting better on Wednesday without treatment that she first started to attribute it to the vaccine, because her back just did not get better on its own. Stated that the first day she did not take anything for the pain because she was worried that it might interact with the vaccine or its effectiveness, but the next day she began taking Tramadol pain meds that she already had in the house for her knee. Stated that the pain in her back was so bad, that even a strong medication like the Tramadol did not take away the pain. It did not help all that much, she had to take a 2nd 50mg tablet 3 hours later. Should she get the second dose of the vaccine? Could it possibly do more nerve damage; could she be jeopardizing her nervous system? Have there been any other reports about this?

My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.

A 68-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on her left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure (Diagnosed 3 to 4 years ago) and thyroid disorder. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient got the vaccine on Saturday and went home and fell asleep, woke up and had lumps in back of neck, they hurt, pain goes around into jaw, up into the face and ear hurts. The patient just tried a hot compress, a hot cloth on there, it seemed to help a little bit for a while. Took some Advil and that helped a little bit, but when it wears off it comes back. Adds she felt dizzy too, and still felt like that too, it started right after she got it, and it comes and goes. The outcome of the event dizzy was unknown while not recovered for the remaining events.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Received the shot around noon on Tuesday , February 23, 2021. Later in the afternoon experienced muscle aches and chills. My head felt kind of weird. Hard to describe except I once had a morphine shot that made me feel close. I spent the next ~60 hours in bed. Fever, severe joint and muscle pain, migraine like headache, and brain fog is about all I remember. It could have been 2 hours or 60  hours, I don&#39;t remember. On Wednesday and Thursday my sedentary heart rate was 101 and 95 according to my Apple watch up from 77 on Tuesday. Couldn?t eat. Food tasted and smelled differently but not in a good way. Woke up this morning,Friday, with a mild headache and very fatigued but mostly back to normal.

                                                Intense pain in lower back and right hip and pain down my legs (all weak and vulnerable areas where I have issues now and then). It is bothersome to the point that I cannot find a comfortable position to relieve the pain.  It feels like my lower body is being seized up, so to speak.  The only way I can sleep is to take 2 Aleeve PM tablets. I take regular Aleeve throughout the day to take the edge off the pain.   The reason I suspect it is a side effect is that a year ago I took the new Shingles 2-dose vaccination.  I had this same reaction after taking the first dose - and it occurred about 2 weeks after that shot.

                                                Patient is a 68 y/o female who enrolled in program on 9/19/2018 who began monotherapy treatment with Pioglitazone 15mg PO on 10/5/2018. Patient called study team stating that she received her second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination on 02/19/21.  Afterwards, she had a sore arm and slept most of the next day.  On 02/21/21, she experienced severe right-sided leg weakness and fell while attempting to go to the bathroom.  She was unable to ambulate and her son took her to the emergency room. She was hospitalized overnight for a serious adverse reaction to the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination.  Multiple sclerosis exacerbation was ruled out after extensive testing. Then, she was transferred a Rehab facility on 02/22/21 for physical therapy and occupational therapy.  She continues study medication without any missed doses.  She will most likely be in Rehab for another week.  She was able to walk 80 feet on 2/25/2021 with a walker and gait belt and ambulatory assistance. This is unrelated to study drug. We consider this to be a Non-UP SAE.  As of 3/4/2021 the patient is still in rehab.

A 68-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9263) solution for injection, intramuscular on left deltoid on 26Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Her headache was very bad, but after treating with 2 tablets of extra strength paracetamol (TYLENOL) 500 mg, her headache was not as bad as it was. This happened suddenly. Her sore throat started the same time as the headache which was currently gone.

A 68-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6201; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 19Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The vaccine was administered in a Public Health Clinic/Veterans Administration facility. Medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She had about 3 surgeries in lumbar area for fusions due to scoliosis in the past years (history of failed lumbar fusions due to scoliosis). Last one was about 5 years ago. Concomitant medications included roflumilast (DALIRESP), duloxetine, loratadine, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) and &#34;Spiri&#34;. The patient previously received pethidine hydrochloride (DEMEROL) and experienced allergies; and previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9264) in the right arm, on 28Jan2021 at 14:00, for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced a little lower back, bilateral hip and groin pain on 30Jan2021. The pain increased as time went on. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, after second injection, the pain (from first injection) became more intense and now has gone up to mid back and shoulders to the point where it hurts to walk, and she trips a lot. Nothing controls the pain including narcotics, heat, ice, Tylenol or ibuprofen. The pain was further described as constant burning, soreness, aching, stabbing and stiffening. The events were considered serious as the events resulted in disability or permanent damage. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association a contributory role of bnt162b2  to  the reported events  cannot  be totally  excluded.  The patient&#39;s history of scoliosis and failed lumbar fusions may also be contributory to the events.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is  received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She reported that she did not have any side effects until the afternoon of Saturday, 06Mar2021. Caller reported that she&#39;s had MS for many many years and that it has been in what she calls remission for a long time.  She stated that the last exacerbation she experienced was following a Tdap vaccination five years before.  Because of this experience, when the Covid vaccine came out, she went through her doctor to see what she should do, if she should get it.  Her doctor recommended that she get the Covid-19 vaccine, but told the caller that she should make sure to go to a health care facility to receive it instead of drugstore or a clinic due to her experience following the Tdap vaccine in 2016. Caller reports that she is now having a similar exacerbation following the Covid-19 vaccine. Exacerbation of MS: Caller stated that it is an ongoing exacerbation that is not getting better.  She stated that she&#39;s sure that it will get better, but she is not sure what she should do about the second dose.

Facial tingling: Caller originally stated that she has been experiencing a lot of nerve sensation, then clarified as facial tingling, in particular around the mouth, below the nose, and on both sides of her face.  She stated that it began on Sunday, 07Mar2021 and was intermittently present on 08Mar2021 probably into 09Mar2021, then it just went away.  She stated that it would come and go. Caller reported that while she is able to walk and has not had to use her wheelchair, that it is a struggle to walk.  She also reported that it is a struggle to do things with her arms and hands.  She stated that if she wanted to eat, in order to pick up the fork she would probably be using 2 hands to get the fork up but can use it once it&#39;s in her hands.  She also reported that a pencil is difficult to pick up as well, stating that she would need to use both hands to pick it up but would be able to use the pencil once she had picked it up. Caller reported that the tingling comes and goes, and she experiences varying degrees of numbness.  She reported that they are a little numb throughout the day and it may get worse depending on what she&#39;s doing. She stated that she isn&#39;t a sitter, she has to get up and move. Caller reported that she called her physician, about the side effects she was experiencing and they instructed her to go to the Emergency Room.  She stated that their concern was what was going on and if it could be Guillain Barre disease, which she stated is extremely rare. Caller reported that when she went to the Emergency Room on 09Mar2021, they did not really do any tests.  She stated that in order to see if there were any new lesions for the MS, they would have to do an MRI of her brain. Caller reported that they did not believe that there were any new lesions, that they thought it was old lesions.  Caller reported that they told her to go home and make an appointment with the neurology resident clinic for that week, clarified as last week, week of 09Mar2021.  Caller reported that she called the neurology clinic as she does not currently have a neurologist, and they informed her that they would not be able to get her in for an appointment until the end of Apr2021.  She stated this was not doing her much good. Caller stated that they had wanted to admit her to the hospital, but told her that she could go home if she promised to follow up with the neurology resident clinic. Caller expressed some frustration, stating that she was really trying to reach out to see what she should do regarding the second dose.  Her physician tells her to go to the Emergency Room, the Emergency Room tells her to go to neurology.  She wants to know what will the second dose do.  She stated that she called the (state) chapter of the national MS society this morning, where they informed her that they had not heard any reports of exacerbations from the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller states that getting additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine is a lifelong decision.  She stated that Covid may not always be a pandemic, but it could come back like a yearly flu.  She stated that because additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine could be required, she wanted guidance on how to proceed. Her second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is scheduled for 25Mar2021. Clinical outcome of facial tingling was recovered on 09Mar2021, while for the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

In the days following, in addition to those symptoms, she began to cough and had a sore throat.  By March 8th, she had lost her sense of taste and sense of smell. We realized we needed to have her tested for COVID-19. We went to a testing area. She was seen and tested. She tested positive for COVID-19 (as did I).  The belief was that our illness was uncomplicated and we were sent home with instructions to monitor our symptoms.  On 03/14/2021, I took her to the hospital because her condition was worsening.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Lot  EJ1686, intramuscular in right deltoid on 03Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient did not receive other vaccine within four weeks.  On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced sore arm and tiredness.  On 07Jan2021 the patient experienced anterior cervical fusion and was hospitalized from 07Jan2021 to 09Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced nausea. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced muscle aches, loss of taste and loss of smell. On unknown date the patient experienced headache. The patient was tested positive to COVID-19 on 11Jan2021. The patient did not visit Physician Office or Emergency Room. Laboratory data included COVID-19 Rapid Test positive on 11Jan2021. The outcome of the events tested positive for COVID-19, and anterior cervical fusion was unknown. The outcome of the events sore arm, tiredness, nausea, muscle aches, headache was resolving. The outcome of the events loss of taste, loss of smell was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 03Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 11Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  This 69-year-old female had medical history of ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The reported anterior cervical fusion was most likely due to concurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the vaccine of BNT162B2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I knew there was potential for side effects before taking the vaccine...I was totally unprepared for so many symptoms and how intense they were and what little I could do to relieve any of them. Never had fever that I am aware of. Today I?m weak and sweating is unreal.  ?? Should I prepare/expect my second dose around Feb. 14 to have the same effect on me.? Not looking forward to that. I was almost ready to go to the ER I was getting so dehydrated and weak.

                                                Two days (Friday) after the injection (Wednesday) a pain arose in my shoulder muscle on my left side just behind the injection site.  By Sunday afternoon the pain became debilitating and the pain spread to my underarm and the edge of the breast area. I applied heat and rested.  The sharp pain interfered with sleep and regular life activities.  On Tuesday morning I applied an ice pack, which relieved the pain.  After applying ice for two more times, the pain subsided and the swelling under my arm disappeared. I was able to resume normal activities with slight discomfort.

So then i left it alone because I didn&#39;t now if that was part of a reaction. When i got home i still had the odor in my mouth. i drank cold water and it went away. I waited. I felt sore on my arm but it wasn&#39;t that bad but as the hours went on it started getting more sore and painful. My arm was sore up to my shoulder and the back. After that the pain started traveling towards to my chest and i started getting pain in my chest. i took Tylenol (1 500 mg extra strength at 11:15 PM). So i waited 15 minutes to go to sleep. i got up the next day and everything was the same, i started putting ice on it and gave it time. I took another Tylenol but the pain was in my chest again a little bit. The third day the pain didn&#39;t come back in my chest and from then i was alright. I also started getting an itch.

She said in a snide voice it?s still the deltoid and she shot my bursa. The evening of the shot I started having severe arm pain and nausea. The next morning I had right scapula rib pain it was hard to breathe my arm hurt very bad I can hardly lift it I went to work. When I got to work I couldn?t function I was so nauseated with the pain I went home that day and I?ve missed three days total from that event of wrong injection site. The pain has gotten worse I can?t lift my arm left right upper down without pain and it?s going into my neck and down to my elbow now I went to the occupational medical doctor. I told him what happened and he said she gave me the shot am I supraspinatus Bursa and I have an injury to my bursa. I came back for a second visit the next week and he said I have bursitis from that now I can?t raise and use my arm that well at all and I have severe pain 24 seven still and he sent me to a physical therapist starting today 2 to 21. It has gotten worse and my shoulder has locked up three times. I still have ongoing pain 24 seven and I want to report a complaint against the girl who gave my shot I thought she was an LPN but she is a MA.  We both work at healthcare clinic. I am a 26 year RN and she did not listen to me and she stuck me anyway against my will.

                                                Started within 2 hours of vaccine (8 pm) an extremely sore arm.  Then the pain started to radiate to my shoulder.  By the next day, it was really painful in my shoulder and across my back almost to my backbone.  It was painful to move my arm up or down or to reach for things. This lasted 3 to 4 days.  Then my neck on the same side as the shot (left) began to hurt so badly I couldn&#39;t move my neck up or down or sideways.  It was strange the way the pain slowly moved across by arm to my shoulder to my back and up my neck.  I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this before.   Today my pain in my neck is bearable but I have soreness and a headache.  I hope I am at the end of the cycle to this event as I am scheduled for my next shot soon.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in the left shoulder area on 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included COPD (has it for lots of years) and nickel sensitivity. She does not have any reactions to her previous unspecified vaccines but had a normal reaction like sore arm. Concomitant medication included bimatoprost (LUMIGAN).  The patient previously received flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine, both for immunization in 2020 around the end of Sep or beginning of Oct. The patient reported side effects regarding the COVID vaccine and said she was a little confused and unsure if she was having a problem or if she should see a doctor. On 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM, she had the first dose of the COVID vaccine and afterward she had a lot of effects which were mostly muscle and body aches in Jan2021. She also experienced some ongoing congestion in one nostril but saw this as just more congestion and that she was having to blow her nose more in Jan2021. She did the (app name) report but didn&#39;t report the stuffiness. She did report that in the first few days she felt like she was having the onset of pneumonia and felt tired and run down (Jan2021). Two days ago, she started feeling itchy (Jan2021) and she didn&#39;t know what it was, she didn&#39;t know if she ate something or what. Now she has developed a rash (Jan2021) which is ongoing until now. Her paperwork said the rash would happen right away if it was caused by the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if this is something she should be concerned about and if the rash could appear or started this long after she had the vaccine. Her second dose is due on 06Feb2021. The patient wanted to know if the vaccine contains nickel or any metal substances in it since she had compared her rash to her nickel sensitivity. The patient wanted to know if rash is a side effect from the vaccine and how long it will last. She didn&#39;t put rash down for the safety check either as she didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine. Today her rash, she is so itchy. She does have it on her neck and certain areas but not everywhere. It looks like what would happen after a bad fever. It is not raised but is like a fever type rash.  She did note that she had an increase dose of a medication eye drops (Lumigan; Lot: T and a 0 or O followed by 544, and NDC: 0023320503. Expiry: Jan2022) around the time the rash started but after getting the vaccine. Her head, neck and back are very itchy. She mentioned that she waited 2 days and did not put this event in the (app name). She would have reported it yesterday, but she didn&#39;t get one yesterday. She also noted that it was very dry there and cold and a person is going to get dry skin.  She does have an allergic to metal and wondered if that was in the product. In her neck area, it looks just like when she would wear a cheap necklace. No treatments received. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit.  The patient has no prior vaccination within four weeks. The patient had not yet recovered from events rash/like a fever type rash and congestion in one nostril/stuffiness; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing ulcerative colitis, ongoing high cholesterol,  ongoing high blood pressure, celiac disease from 2005 (this has been tested too many times to count and it has been negative since after initial diagnosis 2005), arthritis (all her life) ongoing, hip replacement surgeries first done in 2005; repair of same hip in 2015; other hip in 2017. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Historical vaccines include Pneumonia Vaccine, Shingles Vaccine and Flu vaccines; all on an unspecified date for immunization. She never had adverse events with those. Ongoing concomitant medications included rosuvastatin (5 mg tablet) for high cholesterol, mesalamine (400 mg capsule) for ulcerative colitis and lisinopril from 2018 for high blood pressure. According to the patient, she knows that mesalamine is an immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory to keep inflammation in the colon down. This consumer was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Jan2021 14:30 with immunosuppressant mesalamine. The night of 14Jan2021 patient had headache, chills, body aches, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and dizziness like Covid 19 symptoms. She went to the ER during the past 11 days for IV fluids due to deyhydration from the diarrhea. Today, 25Jan2021 is the first day she has been out of the house, except to go to the ER, since she received her 1st vaccine dose. On Jan2021 muscle pain, neck ache, backache, problems with balance and problems with walking. Events probably started with intense diarrhea starting 14Jan2021; then Fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit and chills 14Jan2021; Specific onset dates and onset times unknown otherwise other than between 14Jan2021 and 16Jan2021 onset dates. It was a rolling week of agony after that with one adverse event after another until she ended up in the emergency room on 16Jan2021 because she was so dehydrated and was really sick. She was not admitted to the hospital related to any of these events; but while in the emergency room she was given intravenous fluids; a chest x-ray; blood work; after maybe 5-6 hours she was sent home; she was also given a COVID test which was negative; and then 2 days later took another COVID test which was also negative. Both COVID tests were Rapid Tests: on 16Jan2021 and 18Jan2021. On the Chest xray they suggested she had some sinus tachycardia which is just a rapid heartbeat and not surprising; nothing else showed up on Chest x-ray; as far as anything else testing/results wise there was only some facetious blood work which they just said to follow-up with her PCP regarding but nothing really out of the ordinary. She can finally out of bed on a regular basis for a couple of hours daily; she is still very fatigued; she has no muscle pain, neck aches or body aches at this time; she does not have the strength she should have; is no longer experiencing headaches or fever; but is extremely tired. She will fall asleep through the day for 3-4 hours at a time and she does not even nap usually (Jan2021). She has not driven yet but assumes probably once she is a little stronger she will be able to drive again. She did not have upper respiratory, chest or cough issues. The outcome of the events fever, headache, body ache, muscle pain, neck ache was recovered on Jan2021; fatigue was not recovered. The outcome for the other events was unknown.

                                                eczema flare up, skin red, her left anterior chest was burning and itchy, skin pain; headache; on early Friday evening she ended up with joint pain that was so bad, she thought she was going to die. She said her wrist, elbows, fingers, hips, knees, every joint down to her ankles, hurt; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient; retired nurse) via a Pfizer-sponsored program.  A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right deltoid on 10Feb2021 at 12:35 PM (at age of 69 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a convention center. The patient&#39;s medical history included eczema from 24Dec2018 and ongoing, rosacea (developed Rosacea at 65 years old), and the patient also reported that she used to be 5&#39;4&#34; and she lost 2 inches. She said she had a bone density test recently and was told she is 5&#39;2&#34;. She said she objected to the measurement of 5&#39;2&#34;, so the nurse told her to stand as tall as she can, and then the nurse noted her height as 5&#39;2-1/2&#34;. There were no concomitant medications. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. On 12Feb2021, the patient experienced eczema flare up, skin red, her left anterior chest was burning and itchy, headache, skin pain, and &#34;joint pain that was so bad, she thought she was going to die. She said her wrist, elbows. fingers, hips, knees, every joint down to her ankles, hurt&#34;.  The patient said she received her first COVID-19 Vaccine on 10Feb2021. She said everything was fine after she received her COVID-19 Vaccine. She didn&#39;t even have a mark on her arm where she received the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient reported that she got the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 10Feb2021 and is due to the second dose on 03Mar2021. Approximately 2 and half days later she got an eczema flare that was quite severe out of the blue since she was having eczema diagnosed since she was 67 (as reported; she is 69 today). She still has some itching and burning and she wondered if this was something that has been reported also for other psoriasis/eczema patients. She was concerned about taking the second dose since she thinks this may be caused by the vaccine as she stated that nothing has changed in her life aside the vaccination. The patient reported she takes tacrolimus for the treatment of her eczema. Also she said that she had some joint pain for a couple of days. She said 2-1/2 days later (Friday, 12Feb2021), out of the blue, she had an eczema flare up. She said she was diagnosed with eczema at 67 years old. She said Friday night (12Feb2021) into Saturday (13Feb2021) her left anterior chest was burning and itchy. She clarified her skin was really red and angry looking, and painful. She said she has not had any pain with her eczema in a long time. She said she took topical ointments and medication for the eczema flare up. She said she was surprised at the intensity of her eczema flare up. She clarified her initial diagnosis for eczema was on her left anterior chest and bra strap area, and arms. She said she has never had eczema on her face or any other part of her body. She said she was totally asymptomatic prior to getting her first COVID-19 Vaccine. She said on early Friday evening (12Feb2021) she ended up with joint pain that was so bad, she thought she was going to die. She said her wrist, elbows, fingers, hips, knees, every joint down to her ankles, hurt. She said she had a headache. She said by Sunday (14Feb2021) her joint pain and headache were gone. She said her symptoms went away so quickly. The patient asked if people reported a flare up with psoriasis or eczema after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine and if should she have any concerns about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot on 03Mar2021. The patient her eczema treatment included a combination of oral and topical medications. She clarified she used more of the prescription topical lotion than the over-the-counter oral medications. She received Famotidine 10mg (clarified as Pepcid AC; NDC Number: 11673-031-65, Lot Number:  OFE2821, Expiration Date: Feb2022). Her doctor told her she could take up to 20mg of Famotidine if her symptoms were bad. She said on Friday (12Feb2021) and Saturday (13Feb2021) she took 20mg of the Famotidine until she felt her symptoms were under control. The patient also received cetirizine 10 mg (reported as generic Zyrtec; NDC Number: 11673-502-87, Lot Number: 8ME2877A, Expiration Date: Sep2022). The patient reported that she took 20mg of the generic Zyrtec for the itching. She said her doctor told her she can take up to 20mg of the generic Zyrtec, if needed for itching. She said otherwise, she would normally take 10mg generic Zyrtec, as needed. The patient also received Tacrolimus Ointment 0.1% (Protopic Ointment; NDC Number: 0168-0416-30, Lot Number: JZ8459, Expiration Date: Apr2021), applied to affected areas twice a day and Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream, 0.1% (she stated she refers to it as &#34;TAC&#34; Cream; NDC Number: 67877-251-80, Lot Number: Y064, Expiration Date: Oct2022). The patient reported that she uses the &#34;TAC&#34; Cream under her breasts where her bra sits because the &#34;TAC&#34; Cream is less expensive than the Tacrolimus Ointment 0.1%. She said she uses the &#34;TAC&#34; Cream as needed, and the &#34;TAC&#34; Cream keeps her skin hydrated. She said she used the Protopic Ointment (Tacrolimus Ointment 0.1%) on Friday (12Feb2021), and then switched to the &#34;TAC&#34; Cream. The patient has had no itching or pain since early Monday (15Feb2021). Her joint pain and headache treatment included Advil Liquid Gel 200mg (UPC Number: 305730169080, Lot Number: 56264, Expiration Date: Jun2023). She said she took a couple Advil Liquid Gels on Friday (12Feb2021). The patient reported that she switched from Tylenol to Motrin because the Motrin worked well. She clarified she meant Ibuprofen when she said Motrin. She said she calls everything Motrin when she is referring to Ibuprofen. She said she took Tylenol occasionally and never felt the Tylenol worked. She said she hasn&#39;t taken Tylenol in a long time. She said Tylenol didn&#39;t work as well as the NSAIDs. She did not have the Tylenol NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. The patient reported that she takes Bufferin Brand Aspirin normally for pain. She said she sees someone who treats her holistically, and that person recommended the Bufferin Aspirin because it was not as damaging to the body. She said since the Bufferin Aspirin takes longer to work, she took the Advil Liquid Gel for faster pain relief.  No further details provided. The events eczema flare up, skin burning sensation, skin red, skin pain, joint pain, and headache were reported as serious - medically significant. The patient reported that she felt her symptoms were medically significant because her eczema flare up was so different from what she has ever experienced before. She said nothing had changed in her routine, and she has been in control of her eczema. She said she has had only very minor eczema flare ups. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and to physician office. The outcome of the events eczema flare up and skin red was recovering. The outcome of the events headache and joint pain was recovered on 14Feb2021. The outcome of the events skin burning sensation, skin pain, and itchy skin was recovered on 15Feb2021. The events eczema flare up, skin burning sensation, itchy skin, skin red, skin pain, joint pain, and headache were assessed by the (patient) as related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                My second COVID-19 vaccination injection on Friday morning, 2/19/2021 resulted initially (starting on Saturday, the day following the vaccination} in a sore right wrist and a much more painful right arm that steadily grew in intensity and spread rather rapidly into my upper torso.  By the following day (Sunday, 2/21) my breasts became very sensitive and I had severe pains across my back.  This may or may not have been the beginning of a banding type MS exacerbation, but by Monday, 2/22, it was clear that I was experiencing a full-blown and seriously disabling exacerbation. Both legs experienced the tingling and numbness I have had in a prior exacerbation, and by the time I was able to talk to Dr. (my neurologist) on Monday afternoon (2/22), the numbness had progressed upward into my lower abdomen and I was no longer able to stand at all.  It appears highly likely that the MS attack was triggered by the response of my immune system&#39;s reacting to the discomfort and severe body pains that occurred following the vaccination.  I told Dr. of the total loss of feeling and use of both legs and was experiencing a increasing numbness from toes up to abdomen.  Before ordering the high doses of corticosteroids used to stop my exacerbation, Dr. sent me to the Emergency Room for testing to make sure I did not have an infection that could be covered up by the steroids.  When this testing did not show any such infection, the ER administered an IV infusion of 1 gram of solumedrol, followed by gradually decreasing high oral doses of prednisone.  As of this date, numbness has started decreasing and some limited  utility of right leg has returned.  Still i can no longer stand and perform even the minimal movements to-and-from wheelchair to bed or toilet without substantial physical help (not needed before this exacerbation) from my sole caregiver, my husband.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 69-year-old female patient (wife) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number reported as &#34;ELI283 or EL1283&#34;), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure (abnormal) and cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medications included blood pressure medication and cholesterol. The consumer was reporting on behalf of his 69 year old wife. She received the first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine on 30Jan2021. On 06Feb2021, she started to experience itchiness, a rash, and a big area of redness on her left arm which was the injection arm. He stated he heard that the second dose can cause more side effects and he stated they both experienced arm soreness after the first dose on an unspecified date. Consumer stated, first of all thank you guys for making this vaccine. He and his wife received the vaccine (unspecified vaccine) their first dose last Saturday, a week ago yesterday and had no reaction to it at all, their shoulder was a little sore but that&#39;s it. Yesterday night, last night his wife noticed that the arm where she had the vaccination it has like a rash and he knows this online that Moderna has something called COVID arm but it doesn&#39;t say anything about Pfizer. He meant it&#39;s not to bother it itches a little bit you put some anti-itch cream on it wasn&#39;t a big deal. He was kind of concerned about the next you know they got the next one coming on the 18th, so, does she should change arm, do it on the other arm. Consumer added that that would be fine, he knows you guys want to know if there was any reaction so that you can log it in and that was basically why he called. They were going for their next shot they were going to the hospital and there were professionals there so pretty much ask them what they should do. Should they change arm or nothing to worry about if they do it again that was not the problem he just wanted to let you guys know that there was some kind of reaction a rash. Consumer stated he just put Cortaid cream on it and itch went away. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lab work on 27Jan2021: doctor did for cholesterol, blood pressure reasons and everything was fine. The outcome was recovered for the event itchiness; and unknown for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021170691 same reporter and drug, similar events, different patient

The patient has no medical history and has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included sertraline; docusate sodium, ferrous fumarate (FERRO-SEQUELS); and multivitamin - all taken for unspecified indications, start and stop dates were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6201) on 15Feb2021 17:00 in the right arm for covid-19 immunization at 69-years-old.

                                                excruciating low lumbar pain from L5 and S; Was unable to walk and sit; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse(patient). The 69-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in left arm on 13Mar2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6204) as single dose for precautionary for getting covid 19. Medical history included severe asthma, she had lumbar fusion T9-L5. Her lumbar back area was the worst area on her body even before she got the Covid vaccine. She had been in pain all the time 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There were no concomitant medications. On 14Mar2021 morning, she was unable to walk and sit, experiencing excruciating low lumbar pain from L5 and S. It continued all day, pain excruciated was screaming and crying until yesterday afternoon went to the hospital. She had not experienced pain ever like this. If she got up to use the bathroom, it was pain, excruciating pain the whole time she&#39;s up. The hospital didn&#39;t admit her because she did an MRI with contrast and without contrast and it showed no changes from her last MRI in Nov2020. She was still in severe pain. Doctor in the emergency room gave her 2 IV push of hydromorphone hydrochloride (DILAUDID) and did nothing. There was no pain as long as she&#39;s not moving but when she got up or move or go to the washroom to urinate has excruciating pain. She was supposed to get on the plane tomorrow not able to get out of bed. Pain was localized in one area like stabbing burning and excruciating pain if moving. It&#39;s not like a muscle or joint pain you get from a flu vaccine. She was prescribed Oxycodone 5/325 from the emergency room. She didn&#39;t take any oxycodone last night, she was hesitant to take pain meds. She was laying prone in bed except to get up to restroom, her husband gave her one of the oxycodone before he left for work this morning. It was unknown if the oxycodone was working, since she hadn&#39;t moved yet, she&#39;s laying prone and had not moved to the right or to the left and she just took it about 45 minutes ago. Lab data also included blood work, MRI with and without contrast, Covid test, with unknown results. Seriousness criteria for events was disability. Outcome of events was not recovered. She asked the emergency room doctor could this be related to the Covid vaccine and the doctor would not state whether he thought it was or was not. She&#39;s thinking it was related because it is so new and it&#39;s the only thing new that&#39;s been introduced into her body. Relatedness of drug to reactions by reporter was related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported excruciating low lumbar pain from L5, which resulted unable to walk and sit,  and the administration of the COVID19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

                                                On 3/24, I woke up nauseous, extremely fatigued, with sore joints, headache, and abdominal pain.  A few days later I noticed I had extreme shortness of breath.  I went to see my PCP on or about 3/31.  He listened to my heart and discovered a rapid heartbeat.  He then took an EKG.  He wanted to put me on lifetime meds immediately.  I was in shock because I truly believe this is a reaction to the COVID vaccine.  I have never had arrhythmia.  In fact, I had a wellness visit with the Dr. about 3 months previously and all was good.  I have been seeing him for four years since I moved.  He does not think my new diagnosis is related to a vaccine reaction, but I find it highly suspect that 4 other women in my large circle of friends also have AFIB after 2nd shot. I spent Easter in the ER and they pumped Metoprolol in my bloodstream.  I did not stay in the hospital that night.  I went to see the Dr. on Monday morning on 4/4.  He prescribed Metroprolol 25 mg and Xarelto 20 mg IMMEDIATELY.  I picked up the meds and started this regimen.  In speaking with other women, I believe this terrible diagnosis is a direct result as a reaction from the vaccine.

It was hard/where she got the injection; It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge.; Fever blister; heart beating so out of rhythm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing coeliac disease; hypothyroidism, is diabetic and has irregular heartbeat from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism; hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan medoxomil (OLMESARTAN/HCTZ MYLAN) taken for blood pressure measurement; metformin, glipizide and pioglitazone hcl taken for diabetes mellitus; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81) taken for thrombosis; metoprolol taken for heart rate irregular, cyanocobalamin (VIT B12) taken for an unspecified indication, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine, rosuvastatin, vitamin d2, vitamin d3 and potassium, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198, NDC: 59267-1000-1, expiry: unknown) on 27Feb2021 at 1:40PM for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn&#39;t get into them and she didn&#39;t want to go to the ER. She didn&#39;t have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn&#39;t able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of NT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 08:30 (Lot Number: ER8727; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021, at age of 69 years old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies: Penicillin, Ampicillin, hair color product. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She was allergic to Penicillin, and Ampicillin. As a child, always reacted strongly to any vaccination she was given with a fever and flu like symptoms for a couple of days. With Ampicillin, she thought she was having a heart attack. Was told to stop Ampicillin immediately because she could get a heart attack. This was when she was 25 years old and she never went to the ER. She was allergic to a hair color product in the 1990s and it made her scalp itch really badly. Was given a cortisone shot, which she reacted immediately breaking out head to toe in hives. Has no NDC/LOT/EXP for the vaccinations she reacted strongly to as a child. Stated this was in the 1950s or early 1960s. Clarified she did not have a heart attack with Ampicillin, but it felt like she was having one. Has had cardiograms per her request and her heart and heart walls are perfect. The patient received the first dose of the Covid vaccine at 8:30 a.m. this morning on 26Mar2021. Caller reports around 11 a.m., she experienced excruciating leg cramping going from her buttock down behind her knee and rolling to the inside of her thigh, states that the pain lasted 15 minutes. The patient reports the same pain occurred on the opposite leg around noon and lasted for 15 minutes, states that &#34;the pain was so excruciating that she could barely stand up and it was so agonizing it was unbelievable.&#34; The patient noticed that the inside of her thighs were a little red on the side, both legs from her thighs to her knees. The patient states that she has not been in the sun, and didn&#39;t think it was anything alarming, but this is abnormal for her, states that she received the vaccine in the right arm and her upper torso is fine and her head is clear, asked if anyone else had reported this reaction. She was planned to received the second dose on 16thApr in the early afternoon. The patient stated the COVID shot was already fogging her mind. The patient felt pretty good after first shot. Felt nothing. Fifteen minutes before leaving the diner she got a leg cramp. Was sitting in a booth and didn&#39;t think much of it. Attributed it to the way she was sitting. Around 11AM when she got back to her garage, she was in agony. It hurt from the top of her rear all the way down the side to the back of her knee and rolled to the inside of her thigh. She was in such agony and didn&#39;t know if she could get out of her chair and walk. By the time she reached her apartment it has subsided. An hour later, same thing happened in the left leg. She was laying in bed and texting because she didn&#39;t&#39; know if she would get any other reaction. This leg cramp was even worse. She was in tears. Got off bed to try and walk it off. Initial leg cramp happened in right leg. Was excruciating. Both times it lasted for 15 minutes. Both cramps were from her buttocks, all down to her knees, and rolled over into her thigh. Didn&#39;t know if that was a reaction. It is not typical of anything written on Pfizer&#39;s information or that she had heard. She was concerned. Heard about blood clots, but not with this particular product. Stated second leg cramp subsided. If it hadn&#39;t, she wouldn&#39;t have gone to the ER. Leg cramps was so excruciating. Originally thought it was coincidental and stated she will be 70 on (Date withheld). To say she has never had leg cramps before would be a lie. The way the leg cramps were timed was kind of weird. It was absolutely the same kind of cramp and location just on the a different leg. Weight: Gained 25lbs. Doesn&#39;t have COVID or any symptoms. Tested three to four months ago and was negative. Received first dose COVID-19 Vaccine today, 26Mar2021, at 08:30AM. First leg cramp began 11:00AM in right leg. Second leg cramp began Noon in left leg. Each time lasted 15 minutes. Not having leg cramps right now. Could barely talk when having leg cramps. Was worried about getting clots in legs. Otherwise she would think it was because she was getting older. She doesn&#39;t get leg cramps very often. Doesn&#39;t know when the last time she had leg cramps prior to today. Nurse technician at vaccine faculty stated caller&#39;s allergy history wouldn&#39;t be a problem and she only had to sit for 15 minutes. Received the COVID-19 Vaccine and hardly felt it. Waited for 15 minutes. She was fine until 11AM. She was fine now, but her arm might get a little stiff tomorrow. Arm was slightly tender. Surprised she felt something in her legs. Doesn&#39;t know whether to associate it with COVID-19 Vaccine or not. Has nothing to complain about in the upper torso or from the waist up. Wants to know if this is a reaction or coincidence. Stated she expected to have a stiff arm. The outcome of the event &#34;Cramps in legs&#34; and &#34;pain&#34; was recovered on 26Mar2021. The outcome of other events was unknown.

Onset time was about 05:30-06:00 after she took a shower, pretty much the same thing as with the first dose: additional swelling in her knees. She noticed swelling around the waist, going towards the back which didn&#39;t look right on 11Apr2021. There&#39;s no pain at all, it just looks like she has lumps. She has had no other effects from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine other than feels like she is gaining weight. Patient reported no other relevant concomitant products or other medical conditions. She mentioned regarding Methotrexate that they tell her this is a high-quality drug that knocks the immune system down.

                                                My reaction began typically enough, with a sore arm and chills.  The chills subsided by the evening, but symptoms continued and migrated from there.  The arm remained sore for 3 days and then began to itch.  This itchiness continued on and off for the next 2 days.  My neck and shoulder were also sore.  The shoulder continued to be sore for about 4 days.  I had an intermittent headache, also  for 4 days.  The worst part though, is the nausea, which also comes and goes.  But it can last for many hours and now, even after 8 days, I am still experiencing this.  I can find nothing in the writings about this vaccine to corroborate this side effect and I am therefore worried about the second shot.

                                                Unable to fall asleep the night of the second dose.  Felt progressively worse as night went on.  By 3am, had fever, chills, couldn&#39;t stop shaking or get warm, had headache, skin sensitive almost hurt when touched.  Felt too bad to get out of bed but eventually got up, took acetimetophen, drank water, added clothes and blankets and returned to bed.  Body kept tensing up very tightly so that all muscles were constricted/tights and impossible to relax.  This continued for a few hours.  By morning, I thought I was starting to feel better.  These symptoms returns for a second round about 2pm that afternoon and continued until about 6pm.  On the nights of 2/3, 2/4 and 2/5, I wake up around 3am extremely hot and sometimes damp, despite air temp of 66 to 68 degrees.  This resolves after about an hour and body feels normal.

But was symptomless for a while).  After about 18 to 20 hours after vaccination  experienced severe bilateral metatarsal pain and joint pain on knees and back.    Mild to moderate nasal congestion.  Took 1 gram APAP /Benadryl alternating with ASA 325mg  along with bedrest.   Over the course of 2 days the pain (myalgia and arthralgia), flu-like symptoms and congestion resolved.

Reminded me of the pain one would experience getting a cortisone shot. Three to four hours later pain in shoulder was substantial. Unable to lift arm, at all.  Pain continued throughout the night. Twenty-four hours later some improvement in arm mobility and marked pain.  Forty-five hours later not yet at full mobility and with slight to moderate pain.  Feel more attention to vaccine injection site is needed.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number EJ8982 and Expiration Date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included rheumatoid arthritis, blood pressure high, had Corona virus before in Nov2020, and ongoing ache. The concomitant medication was reported as Lisinopril at 10 mg, one tablet a day for Blood pressure high and Vitamins. Patient woke up this morning (23Jan2021) super tired, light dry cough and face looks a little bit swollen. No just tired, she was feeling like weakness, a lot bone pain or muscle ache like a lot. The patient had some prior ache before but today it was stronger. She still feels some pain. Treatment for bone pain or muscle ache, pain was Ibuprofen. The reporter wanted to know if these symptoms are common reactions to the vaccine; if the COVID-19 vaccine can give a COVID-19 infection; if patient should receive the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine since she was having these side effects. The outcome of events, bone pain or muscle ache, pain was not recovered. The outcome of other events were unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                The  Vaccination Site is a drive thru site.  People roll down the car window and are vaccinated. I am very short. The person who was injecting the vaccine was very tall. My shoulder is below the window so he injected me in the shoulder, not in the muscle of my arm. As that is what was more exposed. He should have had me stand up or he should have opened the door to inject me in the shoulder.  It really hurt, and took quite a lot longer for him to inject than my first vaccination. He had to push hard to inject it.  The stinging snd pain was very different than the quick first shot I received three weeks earlier and the stinging lasted an hour.  I was concerned the vaccine was injected in my shoulder and sent a picture to my doctor. He confirmed it was injected in the rotator cuff. This may cause problems as reported on the CDC website as a warning to vaccinators. What do I do???

A 70-years-old female patient started to received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dystonia and migraines from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 antibody test positive from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medication for dystonia and migraines. The patient experienced a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; to her first dose of BNT162B2 in Feb2021. She had all-over body rash that was &#34;very red, like a tomato&#34; and showed up 35-40hours after her dose.  She states her doctor does not recommend she get the second dose. The patient meant by allergic reaction, she had a number of things, she experienced tiredness, injection site pain, joint muscle pain, she felt unwell, this all happened on the Saturday, the same day she got the vaccine on 13Feb2021. Then on Sunday 14Feb2021, all the symptoms she spoke about were still there and so she rested all day. On 15Feb2021, she looked at her elbows, clarifying the inside of elbow, her elbow creases, and on both elbow creases the skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen down to her thigh, it was working it&#39;s way down to the knee, the color was like a beet red, tomato color,  it was under the arms, started with elbow, was at her neck. The more down the redness spread, the more it red in color it also got. When she noticed this she called the doctor. When she called the doctor, the doctor said get over to the Emergency Room right away. Her husband and her were both on the phone and were telling the doctor that she doesn&#39;t want to go to hospital,  she asked if she can just come into the doctors office. The doctor said No. He told her that needs to get special lab work done, and he needs to send her information over to the ER. He said this could do possible damage to the kidneys. The doctor said lets not forget the last time she did a blood test, which was in Nov2020, at that time she came up positive with COVID antibodies. It could have been possible that she had COVID and was asymptomatic, or she had it. The doctor said that they need to do another COVID test or it could be she had a COVID cold or a cold with antibodies, her doctor doesn&#39;t know. The fact that she had that test that came back with COVID antibodies  test but not have COVID in Nov2020 was something to consider. He was concerned may be there is more to this, or just a rash. The doctor said that he is not equipped say what it should be. The doctor said he will speak with them at the hospital. Tiredness subsided yesterday afternoon on 15Feb2021, it subsided before she went to the ER visit. Right now, it&#39;s kind of like a lasting effect because she is not feeling normal. The injection site pain was still there but not as bad. The joint muscle pain subsided this afternoon around 1 o clock. It first began a half hour after leaving the stadium and she was experiencing it while driving back home, the pain continued and got worse. When she got up on Sunday morning her whole body was in pain, she was not getting better on Sunday and that&#39;s when she sat on couch rest of the day. For red skin, with the temperature of the skin, she didn&#39;t feel it to see if it was hot or anything, it was more this feeling that its just not going away getting worse, it didn&#39;t feel hot, there was no texture on the skin either. She just noticed she was flushed red. She called the doctor first, and he said that he was sending information to the emergency room. Then she went to (name of place withheld) ER. They took her temperature, there was no fever. She was then relieved from the ER in 2.5 hours and went home. She still has redness on the skin. In the hospital, they gave her 40 mg of prednisone and an injection or Benadryl, and prescription for prednisone to take for the next 4 days while tapering down. She did take Benadryl about 2 hours ago, she did notice all the sudden she was getting itchy. She is less itchy now. With the itchiness, she just observed this about 2 hours ago. She took Benadryl, she has somewhat improved, she is still itchy but not to the point that she will scratch heavily. She does not have her COVID CDC Card at the moment, her husband has that information but he is on a conference call with a client and she cant disturb him. The patient was scheduled for a second dose on 06Mar2021. That&#39;s where she has a question, the doctor is saying that he is not sure about getting second shot. They took lab work at the hospital and said everything was fine except for white blood cell count, it was on the lower side in Feb2021. She has had no vaccines on the same day or in the 4 weeks prior. She hasn&#39;t had any vaccines. She did have to visit the emergency room.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The possibility that suspect drug may have contributed to the reported event cannot be excluded.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Very tired after vaccination.  Went to sleep about 8 PM Sat 1/16 and slept most of the next 4 days.  Stomach  was queasy.  Unable to drink coffee.  Tried to push fluids and tried to just eat bland foods.  Would wake up sporadically but was unable to awaken enough to watch an entire TV show. Pretty lethargic and brain fog.  Was able to wake up a little more on Wed 1/20 but still had the queasy stomach.  Started getting Headache and Eye pain and severe upper leg  and lower back burning &amp; cramping, I tried taking tylenol which helped a little.  By Thursday  the pain was worse.  I was still tired  only walking helped the pain. It got worse if I sat down and extremely bad if I laid down to try to sleep. It&#39;s Friday morning &amp; I am planning to go to med check this AM.  Symptoms still ongoing

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EJ1686, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 11:00 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arm soreness from flu shot 2-3 months ago. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on her left arm on 31Dec2020 as she works with elderly at nursing home and she was of age. Two days after her shot, on 02Jan2021, she experienced little headache which lasted all day but was gone by the following day. On 12Jan2021, 2 days ago, when she woke up and got of bed with severe pain in right shoulder joint and right hip joint which lasted for maybe 10 minutes. It was so severe she could hardly get out of bed. Currently, she had no joint pain. The right shoulder and right hip pain were so odd she thought, but it has also improved since. It&#39;s been 2 weeks and she never had this happen before. This lasted a little while, but thought it was from the cold weather since it&#39;s been 2 weeks since having the vaccine. She still has a bit of tenderness on the left arm where she received the vaccine dose on an unspecified date. She mentioned this to her supervisor and was encouraged to call and she wants to know if this could be a side effect. The patient had no vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. She had the flu shot before in past and the area would be sore for a few days, but now with this Covid vaccine this arm was still tender. Also, she had gotten the shingles shot the same day as the flu shot but that was about 2-3 months ago, at least 2 months ago. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Covid vaccine. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the first administration. Outcome of event headache was recovered on 03Jan2021; severe pain in right shoulder joint and right hip joint/it was so severe she could hardly get out of bed was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of tenderness on the left arm where she received the vaccine dose was not recovered.

                                                The next day I woke up with severe muscular pain and joint pain, fever of 100 degrees, dizziness, headache, appetite loss. Took 2 Tylenol and it improved. 6 hours later I took another 2 Tylenol because the headache came back strong. I sleep a couple of times during the day, and also slept well during the night. The next day felt a little bit better but still in bed, but was able to eat better. The next day went to the Dr. and he prescribed me Meloxicam and 6 hour later Tylenol, after that is getting better.

Probably after 8AM I took my temp and I had a fever (102F) for about 10 hours. Started aching all over, joint and muscle aches, I also had headache (took Motrin and headache went away),  no pain at the injection site. Almost like I had flu symptoms. I felt miserable all day but next day when I woke up I was fine. Went to work as normal the next day. I forgot to state I had COVID in March 2020 and the symptoms I had felt very much like it.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 19Jan2021 08:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. She was sick (COVID symptoms) all Dec2020 when she was with her sister who had COVID-19. She does not know for sure that she had COVID 19 because she was never tested. She recovered from that illness about two weeks before getting the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine first dose. The cough was all gone before she had the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

That night when I went to bed I felt chilled and woke up several times feeling chilled.  In the morning I felt sick with similar symptoms as when I had COVID-19 in March2020. I had head pains, inner ear pains, naseau, sore muscles, and extreme fatigue. I slept the whole day, waking up and going back to sleep. I dranka little, but just didn&#39;t feel like it. I ate a piece of toast with butter that evening and then felt naseauated.  I slept through the night and woke up feeling a little better the next day, but still feel tired and have some pains in my head.

                                                The patient initially presented (3/3/21) with headache, fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, malaise. Patient related she was in her normal state of health and only started to feel poorly after she received her second COVID-19 vaccination three days earlier.  She interestingly related that after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination she had significant burning in her stomach that she noted but no other major symptoms and notably did not experience this severe burning in her stomach after the second dose. She denied any chest pain, current dyspnea, productive cough, sore throat, urinary symptoms, sick contacts.  She has no history of C. difficile, no recent antibiotics, no recent spoiled foods, no recent travel, no history of radiation.  She does have a history of GERD and has had gastritis with mild gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and undergone EGD negative for H. pylori infection.  She also has undergone colonoscopies with polyps that have been removed and reported as tubular adenomas.  As her hospitalization progressed, she was diagnosed with Severe Sepsis due to E. Coli bacteremia in setting of liver abscess, Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Transaminitis (which resolved). Patient was appropriately treated for these conditions. Also, her known uncontrolled diabetes was treated. Per an Infection Disease note on 3/9/21: The patient has had hx of biliary colic (self diagnosis) now with discovery of non-obstructive cholelithiasis on RUQ US it is plausible that the abscess originated from self limiting cholecystitis/cholangitis which would be consistent with recent abdominal pain exacerbated with oral intake. Difficult to state definitively any relation to COVID-19 vaccination, though may have resulted from associated dehydration.

The pain was continuous, and it doesn&#39;t disappear. Reporter mentioned that it gets better with medication but it&#39;s still not going away. Regarding patient&#39;s treatment, it was reported that in the beginning, patient was taking ibuprofen but now the doctor switched it to naproxen (ALEVE) and also added hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen (NORCO).

Reporter added that the eye floaters started more in the last one week. They do not know why this is happening, if it was vaccine related or not. The medicines the patient takes shouldn&#39;t be causing these, but they don&#39;t know if it was the medicine causing it or if it&#39;s the vaccine.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Feb2021 at 15:00 (at the age of 71-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago, obesity, asthma with bronchitis as a child, allergy to other medications, anaphylactic reaction to sulfas twenty years ago (also reported as 50 years ago), muscle hurt/sore arm usually when she got a flu vaccine (unspecified) once a year, allergies to makeup and clothes (diagnosed at least 50 years ago), heart beats fast, low thyroid and borderline high cholesterol.

The patient did not receive any other vaccinations on the same day or within 4 weeks of the vaccine. The patient previously took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) as pre-medication since she had allergic reactions to some things and would get this before the flu shot; as well as salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA) for runny nose and coughing. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 28Feb2021, and &#34;they&#34; wanted to give her diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) after the vaccine but could not since she was driving. After the vaccination, the patient was not feeling well for 2 days (as of an unspecified date) and thought she was getting better. On 28Feb2021, the patient experienced anxiety. She was more anxious when &#34;that stuff&#34; appeared on the news on day 4 and 5 after the vaccine. She took a small dose of clonazepam 0.5 mg, dividing the pill in 4 pieces as she never took the whole thing. She took it when she got extremely anxious and tried not to take it because it can be habit forming. She may take it 3 times a week or in the middle of the night. It helped a little bit, but she still felt panicky and upset. She woke up feeling anxious. She did not normally take these medications. The patient reported that she experienced headache (constantly several times a week) and left arm sore at injection site, itchiness/ itching all over body (not constant but still happening) from 28Feb2021. On Mar2021 (day 4), the patient experienced dizziness (comes and goes and was not constant like it was), was very exhausted, nausea (tapered off after 2 weeks), diarrhea, some cramping in stomach, brain fog (still struggling and forgets to take her insulin, not as bad as when she first noticed), body aches. At first, the body aches were a pain in the left knee and left elbow and then moved to various joints and muscles. The left knee and elbow pain persisted without ever going away, but also moved to different areas. The calf muscle in left leg pain is also constant. The patient experienced pain in the joints and stinging pain in left leg (below knee down to ankle) from 04Mar2021, runny nose (tapered off) from 07Mar2021, and on an unspecified date muscle pain, back pain, fever, neck pain, pain in left arm. On Mar2021 (two weeks after vaccination), the patient had a red circle around injection site not all the way filled in, but rim around where she got shot. On Mar2021 (3 weeks after vaccination), the patient experienced a weak feeling in arms and legs and other times when she stood up her body felt heavy (persistent but not every day).

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at left arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included low sodium, Covid-19 in Nov2020 (She had felt sick for a week and on 13Nov2020 she went to the ER and they did blood tests and she could not eat or drink for 3 days. She stated that she had 4 different IV fluids going and one of them was sodium and the other was for nausea), blood did not clot properly, broke her back. There were no concomitant medications.The patient had a unique reaction after receiving the Covid-19mRNA Vaccine. She clarified that she never had a reaction to a shot before. She received the vaccine on 31Dec2020 and was fine for the first 20 hours. She said that the next morning on 01Jan2021 at 0600 she woke up cold  and could not get warm. She said that she spent the next 24 hours to where she kept adding clothes and blankets to keep warm. She stated that she was freezing and the she felt like the interior of her body was freezing even down to her toes felt cold. She also had injection site pain and the arm felt heavy and stated that the pain extended from her shoulder down to her elbow. She stated that the injection site pain was kind of delayed. She had aches and pains. She said that some of the pain went from the injection shoulder and spread to the middle of her spine. She had nausea and total loss of appetite and could not even eat. Her aches and pains after the vaccine were similar aches like she had with the Covid. She said that she had a terrible headache when she had Covid though. She stated that after the 24 hours of receiving the vaccine she had a little headache, but she took a migraine pill for it. She said that she was able to shed clothes, but she could not take a shower, but within 24-36 hours she was back to normal like it all never happened. She said that was when she figured out it was like her hemorrhaging with one of her childbirths. She explained that she had 3 children and hemorrhaged with each of her child births and was going into shock with one of them and felt this freezing sensation due to blood loss. She thought that her reaction to the vaccine was so bad that she was either not making blood or there was an interference. There was some kind of weird interruption. She said that her blood clots break down from minutes to hours after her child birth or with dental procedures. She had a PAI-1 deficiency or Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 deficiency. She said that there was also something deeper that her doctors had not figured out yet too. She said that her blood did not clot properly. She said that she did not bruise or anything, but she was not allowed to have internal surgery without a transfusion. She said that her doctor&#39;s started to figure this all out after she broke her back before. She went to a hematologist and had her counts checked regularly. She said that she was being studied by 127 different clinics. She gained 10lbs, but she was very physically active. This was her first dose of teh vaccine. She said that her doctors told her that she needs to be under 48 hours of observation if she gets the second vaccine. Her primary care physician recommended that she did not take another mRNA vaccine. She said that she was taking their advice and canceled her second dose appointment. She said that when she had Covid-19 they did a Chest x-ray on 13Nov2020 and she had low sodium. She said that they gave her tramadol at the hospital for her headache, but she had already taken 3 migraine pills that day. She had already had her flu shot and read somewhere on a website, that mRNA vaccines might cause unstable anticoagulation. She wondered if it could be possible that Covid-19 antibodies interfered with her injection? The outcome of events was unknown.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EK9231, via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization.

She wonders if she is out of her head, since it was the very next morning, this was Tuesday, and instantly, she was sitting with ice and trying to get ahold of her healthcare person, she gets pain shots in her back, but she hasn&#39;t had them in a couple years, she was going along pretty good, then this was bad enough, it is in her thigh and leg, and is always under her foot, and she just thought it was swelling in her spine. She wonders if it is a side effect or her imagination. When asked for address, the patient stated her brain is going blank. She stated this may be just her. She has bad back problems, and was going along pretty good, it has been a year or two since she has had any kind of anything. But this was a good one, a strong one, the ice hurts so bad. She woke up with it, it is staying the same- after having something like this, she was trying to get ahold of the pain clinic, to get a shot, but that may be 3-4 weeks out. She has had no blood work in a while. Outcome of the events &#34;she just thought it was swelling in her spine&#34; and &#34;her brain is going blank&#34; was unknown; while not recovered for other events.

Medical history included anxiety, seizures, and high cholesterol. She passed out last summer and they put her in the hospital from 31Aug2020 and ran all kinds of tests. In the end, they said she only had a few PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) and she doesn&#39;t need to see the doctor for a year. Mentioned she also has chronic bronchitis and this is related to having low platelet count and low immunity. All of these events predate treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin for high cholesterol, clonazepam for seizures, escitalopram for anxiety, levothyroxine sodium for thyroid, and mirtazapine for sleep; all were ongoing.

About three or four hours later on 13Jan2021, she was getting ready for bed and when she sat down and leaned over she had a god awful burning in her chest and nausea. She was going to take baking soda but when she sat up she had horrible pressure and pain in her chest and felt woozy so she sat on the floor and then the pain started to radiate through her arm and into her neck. The horrible pain and pressure in her chest felt like something was sitting on her chest and the bad pain in her chest was going into her arm and a little into her neck. She laid real still on the floor, and did a lot of praying, and then 20 minutes later it totally stopped. She got up slowly and finished getting ready for bed and was fine. She was just hoping they will still let her get the second shot. The whole event only lasted 20 minutes and when it was over it was completely gone. She did tell her husband when he came home. She was alone when this happened. The patient wanted to know if she can receive second dose of vaccine. She stated it almost felt like a heart attack. She was planning to get the second dose on 03Feb2021. Wanted to know if her effect will preclude her from getting the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.

Medical history included her left eye had a virus that was finally taken care of back in Mar2020 but took a year and a half to heal. She had 5 surgery on that eye from an unspecified date. Also, her left lymph node got filled with fluid and was swollen but the doctors were not concerned about it. She would see an ENT for this. The patient has been seeing a neurologist who has done brain scans and MRI&#39;s due to the loss of peripheral vision do to eye problems. The patient has no allergies and is basically healthy. Concomitant medications include unspecified &#34;natural stuff&#34;. The reporter stated she had a pretty bad reaction with the vaccine and it took 3 days to get over, her neck froze up. She woke on 22Jan2021 with the frozen neck. She got the first shot on Thursday, 21Jan2021, and on Friday morning, 22Jan2021, when she woke up she could not look up, down, left or right. It was like her neck was frozen or paralyzed, the muscles would not move. Any effort to move her neck would send shooting pain in her head. She applied a heating pad, took Aleve, she took a couple of them, a massager, biofreeze, and stayed in bed. She was doing anything to loosen the muscles. The next morning she was able to look up and down but still not left or right. She did the same thing for treatment that day. On Sunday, 24Jan2021, she was better, was able to move her head 3 of 4 directions. She continued with the treatment she had been using and by Monday, 25Jan2021, her muscles loosed up and her neck worked again. She was sure it is muscles and when she called her neurologist confirmed it was a muscle issue. She was in a lot of pain in her head and neck. The patient was under care for her neck and head and wondered if this happened because this was a weak area, she did not know if related. The patient remarked she was scared to get the second dose due to the problems she had with the first. She heard that the second dose was the one with worse side effects. She was in bed 3 days with this first one. It was reported that the events did not require a visit to Emergency Room, and required visit to physician office. Patient called the neurologist due to the pain and was told to go to acute care to evaluate but she didn&#39;t go. The patient stated that this was scary like waking up with Bells palsy and was wondering if she would ever get better. She has never had anything like this happen to her before. She has to be attributed it to the shot. The patient needed guidance on getting the second dose, and had questions about side effects. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at a single dose, in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fibromyalgia diagnosed years ago, angina (some stents). There were no concomitant medications. On Jan2021, the patient experienced angina, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, nausea, diarrhea, headache, arm heavy, muscle aches and heaviness, and she just woke up feeling sick. The patient experienced multiple AEs after 1st dose of vaccine (received on 23Jan2021). The patient experienced angina later last week. Clinical course: The patient has misplaced card, states her second appointment for the second dose is this Saturday. Caller stated she started having these experiences the day after she was vaccinated with her first dose, received first dose of 23Jan2021. She had fevers, chills, cough- not an aggressive cough, a funny kind of sore throat- like something wrapped around her throat like the muscles of her throat, no congestion but does have a runny nose, states she has some nausea, no vomiting but feeling like she needed to vomit and diarrhea, and headache. The symptoms started about the third day after the vaccine, started with the fevers, stated the fevers may come like a hot flash, lasts seconds even, states you know it is a fever because your bones get hot. These symptom&#39;s did not attack her body at one time. Her whole arm stayed heavy, the whole arm not just the injection site, for almost 10 whole days. She previously had fibromyalgia and thought maybe that made the symptoms worse. She had muscle aches and feeling heavy. Her symptoms were spread out over time, no two were at the same time, sore throat was one of the last things. Diarrhea was ongoing, not a runny diarrhea but it was enough to empty stomach and was soft. She was a medic in the military, worked as a Nurse, clarifies she was an LPN and took all the underlying courses to be a PA. One of the issues she found, she thought it may be deadly, as a prior healthcare person and in tune to her body, the people who are in the nursing homes may not be mobile, states so one of the things she felt was just feeling really really sick, that she couldn&#39;t put a pin point on it, states she just woke up feeling sick, states she had the urge to get out of bed and got up and after she got up the feeling left her, states a person in the nursing home may just feel really bad and cannot get up, thinks a protocol should be that the people that are immobile should be required to move or if they can&#39;t get up they need to move their muscles, people with these symptoms need to get up and get moving. She also has history of angina and a stent, has not had angina in a while and had 3 days where she thought she may need to go talk to her doctor. It was on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week. States one of her friends, 92 years old, said she got high after the vaccine and didn&#39;t want to talk to anybody, states it was her first dose, she was kind of leery about the 2nd shot, feels like this was kind of aggressive. She had both doses and had no symptoms, but 92-year-old female had no symptoms right away, other than normal body aches and pains, but the next day was high as a kite. Her son has heart disease and she advised him not to take it right now. They were losing a lot of people to the vaccine in nursing homes, no further information provided. This could be affecting good hearts more than damaged hearts, read that this virus likes to work in parts of the body that are already damaged. The outcome of event diarrhea was not recovered, outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, a causal association between the reported angina and BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. Note however, that the patient has underlying angina with some stents that may also have contributed to the event. Case will be re-assess once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

I threw up midway, and then just slept. Felt a little better around 2:00 pm, took Tylenol at 4:00pm and that helped a lot. Got out of bed at 5:00 pm. Was able to eat a little dinner at 6:00 pm. Went back to bed around 9:00. Felt better in Am -Sunday, Feb 28; not 100% though. Tired. Long nap. Better today, Mar. 1.  -- just a little off - woozy.

                                                Too long to have muscle pain from a shot; Migraine headache; severe arm pain where the shot was injected; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9261; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration from 21Jan2021 to 21Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for an unspecified indication. Medical history included &#39;thyroid&#39; from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing at 100 ug, 1x/day for &#39;thyroid&#39;. Patient stated that she spoke with her physician&#39;s assistant. Patient received vaccine on the 21st of January, the first shot at her local place. The following morning at 4 in the morning, patient had severe arm pain where the shot was injected. So patient put a hot compress on it and took some paracetamol (TYLENOL). Patient mentioned that it didn&#39;t relieve for about an hour and a half. Patient meant the pain was really severe but finally it went away. The next day, it came back again and then the patient did it again and the pain keep coming back. Patient stated &#34;And now it&#39;s been tomorrow will be a week. And that&#39;s too long to have muscle pain from my shot&#34;. Patient also mentioned that second day after the shot, migraine headache started. Patient stated, &#34;Now I get them, but I only get them in the spring and I get them in the Fall. I don&#39;t get the migraine headaches in the winter time. I could only take Excedrin Migraine for the migraine, it&#39;s just over the counter medicine. And so I took that for the headache but those have not gone away either. When patient contacted her physician&#39;s assistant just now, it was reported that patient the physician&#39;s assistant is going to write a prescription for a muscle relaxer. Patient also reported that she is not going to take that second shot as she didn&#39;t know where to go to cancel it but she is not taking it. Patient mentioned she can&#39;t have pains like this. Patient stated that she can&#39;t tolerate pain to begin with, let alone have excess pain in her system. Patient added that she doesn&#39;t take medications. She is only on a thyroid medication (later confirmed the name as levothyroxine). Patient confirmed that the vaccine was Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. When probed for the due date of the next shot, patient stated &#39;February 11th at 12 o&#39; clock&#39;. Patient also stated &#39;I am not getting it, I am not taking the second shot. I didn&#39;t get you, I don&#39;t know what you said. I am not understanding you. I am not getting what you are saying. I am not taking the second shot, it is scheduled for February 11th of 2021, I am not taking it. Because they called and asked if I wanted to receive it and my age is almost 73. So, I thought I probably should give it a chance. But now with the reaction I don&#39;t want the second one&#39; and &#39;I don&#39;t know if there is something wrong with this phone or something wrong with the connection, I don&#39;t understand, I get part of it but I don&#39;t understand the other part. It blanks out, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong, you are asking me something, but I don&#39;t know what it is&#39;. Patient also reported that the pain started the day after she got the shot, 22Jan2021. Patient is still having pain. Patient also confirmed that TYLENOL was the treatment for pain but it was not working. Medication for migraine was reported as EXCEDRIN migraine. Patient further confirmed EXCEDRIN Migraine did not help with the migraine and stated &#39;No, I still have it, it gives me some relief but then after wears off it comes back, the migraine comes back&#39;. Patient further added &#34;Okay, I am just going to rely on my physician assistant, she has got some medication ordered for me, a muscle relaxer. And I am going to try that and see if that will make everything go away&#34;.  Outcome of the events &#39;severe arm pain where the shot was injected&#39; and &#39;migraine headache&#39; was not recovered; outcome of the remaining event was unknown.

Patient reported that she had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and saw a rheumatologist that specializes in treating fibromyalgia. At 01:00 AM on 17Feb2021, fourteen hours later, she awoke to not being able to turn over in bed. Her hands, feet, toes and entire body, felt almost paralyzed. She could not bend her fingers or toes. Her muscles throughout her body remained stiff and tight for the next 16 hours. Chills, headache but no fever. Patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL) every four hours, during this time. It did not help with the tense muscle aches. Later on 17Feb2021 (that same day), approximately 19:00 (7:00 PM), her muscles started to relax. Patient was writing this the day after and she felt fine. She could hardly wait for the booster shot. Outcome of the events was recovered/resolved in Feb2021. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.

The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020 and lost taste and smell. Reported she tested positive for the COVID-19 Virus in Nov2020. She said she was never sick during the time she had the COVID-19 Virus, though she lost her sense of taste and smell. She said she may have had a headache during that time, but she doesn&#39;t know if the headache was from the COVID-19 Virus or something else. She said anything she was experiencing during the time she had the COVID-19 Virus was kind of normal for her. Concomitant medications were none. Reported she got her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 22Jan2021, and thinks she may be having an adverse reaction. She said after she received her COVID-19 Vaccine, she was OK for the remainder of Friday, 22Jan2021, as well as, Saturday morning, 23Jan2021. Reported she was working outside the day before she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose (21Jan2021). She clarified she had a tree cut down in her yard, and she moved all the 3 foot length cut-up pieces of tree by herself. She had been moving tree cuttings. Her arm was mildly sore. Reported on Saturday (23Jan2021) in the middle of supper, she experienced a horrible pain in her left back. She clarified that the pain was above her left kidney, and the pain ran from the bottom of her left rib cage to the bottom of her left butt cheek. She said the pain was so bad she didn&#39;t think she was going to be able to finish eating supper. She said after supper she got on a heating pad and walked around the kitchen to see if that would help with the pain. She said she sat on the heating pad and walked around the kitchen 4 times that night. She said by Sunday (24Jan2021), the pain started to go away, and by Sunday night, she was OK. Reported this past Thursday, 28Jan2021, she was going to her mailbox. She said while she was walking out to her mailbox, she was holding onto her front porch post to go down the front porch stairs, and her left leg collapsed out from under her. She said she would have fallen if she wasn&#39;t holding on to the front porch post. She said she tried to continuing walking to the mailbox, and her left knee went out from under her again. She said her left leg kept wanting to buckle under her. She said after she got back inside her house, she sat down in a chair to read a book. She said she was making soup at the time and grabbed her husband&#39;s cane to walk to the kitchen. She said she is short and got on her 2-step stool to look in the freezer for vegetables. She said while she was on the top step of the stool, her left knee buckled and her left leg went out from under her. She said she fell straight back, landing on the floor. She said she has 2 big bruises on arm, 1 bruise at her elbow and 1 bruise on her upper arm. She said her left leg went out from under her again, yesterday (31Jan2021), while she was going to church. She said everything she has experienced since getting her COVID-19 Vaccine shot is only happening on her left side. Reported her left knee keeps wanting to go out and she has to be really careful when she walks. She said her left knee feels like it is wanting to buckle, like when someone runs up behind you and hits the backside of your knee. She said her left leg muscle is sore from above her left knee. She said she doesn&#39;t know if what she is experiencing is from getting her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and she wanted to know if anyone else has reported a similar experience since receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. For fall treatment, she took a couple of Aleve 220mg tablets (UPC Number: 325866555090, Lot Number: NAA6W3T, Expiration Date: Jun2021) on 28Jan2021, after she fell off her stool.

Reported she is trying to lock her left knee when she walks, saying she can feel her left knee giving away.  She said she while she was walking down a small ramp at church on Sunday (31Jan2021) her left knee wanted to buckle from under her. She said she had to hold onto a railing while she was walking down the ramp, so she wouldn&#39;t fall. She said she is not used to her left knee trying to go out from under her.

                                                Discovered a lump about three inches to the left of my throat while I was on my way to my doctor&#39;s office for my annual wellness exam    when I  felt a sharp pain near that area.  I instinctively reached over and put my hand on the area and immediately felt a lump. My doctor examined me and asked me some questions about when I first felt the lump and how was I feeling, etc.  I told her I had my second vaccine three days prior.  She gave me a prescription for bloodwork which is part of my annual exam process along with an appointment to see me again on March 16th.   I had the bloodwork yesterday morning.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

A 72-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Mar2021 14:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) as SINGLE DOSE (at the age of 72 years) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included partial seizures, autoimmune thyroiditis, eczema, osteoarthritis, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing 10 years ago.  The patient is not pregnant, and the patient did not have Covid prior vaccination.  Concomitant medication included phenytoin (DILANTIN) taken for seizure, start and stop date were not reported; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); ergocalciferol (VIT D) and unspecified vitamin.  The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced drug hypersensitivity, erythromycin and experienced drug hypersensitivity, azithromycin and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced mini stroke or seizure on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, left arm was weak, numb, cold and a fine tremor on extension of arm on 03Mar2021 14:45 with outcome of recovered.  On 06Mar2021, patient woke up and left arm was weak, numb, cold and she had a fine tremor on extension of arm. Symptoms resolved after 45 minutes but returned within 30 minutes and lasted another 45 minutes.  No treatment was received for left arm was weak, numb, cold and she had a fine tremor on extension of arm.  Patient called doctor, spoke to the advice nurse and was advised to go to the ER (emergency room) now. Patient did deep breathing and relaxation, symptoms resolved, and did not go to the ER. Instead spoke with a doctor and agreed to go to the ER if symptoms returned. Patient also had a video visit with primary doctor, and she was advised to take baby ASA. The Doctor said it could be a pinched nerve on unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Symptoms have not returned. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 08Mar2021.  The case was reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject vaccine contributed to the CVA and other events.  The reported events likely represent intercurrent medical conditions.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including Head CT/MRI,  EEG,  counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 73-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 06Jan2021 around 13:00-14:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient got the vaccine this week on 06Jan2021 right after lunch/early afternoon. She had no issues. In the afternoon of 07Jan2021, she started getting a little dizzy and had a hard time focusing her sight. The patient also had neck and toe stiffness on 07Jan2021. She did not think about the vaccine until last evening of 07Jan2021. The hospital called to see how she was doing, and then it dawned on her. After, she took her blood pressure which was 126/68 with 81 pulse. She slept well last night of 07Jan2021. This morning on 08Jan2021 she had breakfast but still felt a little off kilter. It is like dizziness, not really dizzy, but more like her balance does not feel right. She was focusing better on 08Jan2021, but not like normal. The dizziness hit her on 07Jan2021 about 15:00. It had improved. She felt more at the time of the report, not really dizzy, but more like her balance did not feel right. It was earlier on 07Jan2021 around 14:00 she was on the ladder taking down her Christmas bows. She had no dizziness whatsoever. For neck and toes stiffness, she had one big toe that was arthritic and it did not seem to want to bend. She had been doing neck exercises which had helped. The outcome of dizziness, hard time focusing her sight, neck and toe stiffness were resolving, outcome of rest events were unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Started with join pain for a few days, started taking one Aleve a day. The muscles became extremely sore. Joint pain increased, involving shoulders, hands, legs, arms, knees and hips. Left hand began swelling on January 23rd and continued so I could no longer see my knuckles and it ballooned and it was hot and very painful. The knees were so bad it was almost impossible to stand from a sitting position and walking was stiff. Could not sleep laying down because pain in shoulders and knees would increase.   I went to the doctor on the 26th.   he prescribed Prednisolone for one week and I am scheduled to see him next Tuesday February 2nd.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 20Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing &#39;sometimes her hip and leg would hurt prior to getting the vaccine&#39;.  There were no concomitant medications. Caller received the covid shot on Wednesday, 20Jan2021, her arm was sore yesterday (21Jan2021) but better today (22Jan2021). Caller reports worsening hip and leg pain on 22Jan2021 because sometimes her hip and leg would hurt prior to getting the vaccine. Caller would like to know if it&#39;s okay to have taken Tylenol for her symptoms after taking the covid vaccine. Response: The interim ACIP guidelines note that, &#34;Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.&amp; quot;  If you are a patient, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider. Caller would like to know how long the symptoms from the covid vaccine would last. Calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine she took it on Wednesday (20Jan2021), the Pfizer Biontech, and yesterday (21Jan2021) her arm was sore all day, which is probably to be expected, but today (22Jan2021), she has, her hips and legs feel real achy, she has achiness in her hips and legs, it was asked if that is normal. it was asked if it is a side effect from the shot. Her arm is not like it was yesterday (21Jan2021) if the achiness was a side effect, she thought she may have had it yesterday (21Jan2021), but she didn&#39;t, just today (22Jan2021). The outcome her arm was sore yesterday but better today/her arm was sore was recovering. The outcome of other events was not recovered.

On Jan 29th,   I woke up to stabbing pains in my right chest which continued to night of Jan 30th.  Morning of Jan 31st, I was very short of breath and could hardly get around.  I went to the ER in evening of Jan 31st.  I was admitted due to two pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  Doctors were convinced I had Covid 19.   However, three tests came up negative.  I was put on a Heparin drip and then eventually on Eliquis.  I have always been healthy up to this point and never had any clotting issues.  I now am on Eliquis for at least six months (have to have a follow-on echocardiogram due to issues on right side of my heart.).  I am convinced the vaccine triggered the clots.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fever, being ill (deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks) and bug bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient is the type of person that takes a lot for her to take medications. She is allergic to a lot of things; she always has crazy reactions. She can&#39;t take morphine. It took her 7 pills to get the right one for high blood pressure. She has the craziest one-day reactions.  She received the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday much against her will, knowing she had COVID but not diagnosed in March. She had a fever, she was deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks. She had a nasal swab done and it came back negative. She doesn&#39;t think that was right, she believes she had COVID-19 in Mar2020. Her daughter is younger, and she had the same thing, she couldn&#39;t breathe good for 3 weeks. She had pneumonia. She knows she had COVID-19. She was trying to lose weight. She was given her first COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor. Everything was going okay at first. About an hour and a half later, she became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness. She can&#39;t describe it. She has never taken drugs. She doesn&#39;t drink alcohol at all. She has like a virgin body. She states plus she is red headed, which it is known red heads have a harder time with medication. As the day goes on, she just felt lightheaded all the rest of the day. The next day (Sunday, 31Jan2021), she wakes up and it hits her like a ton of bricks. She woke in the morning and seemed to be okay and then it was like she was pregnant and blew up. She started cramping really bad and had gas. Everybody has gas. She was a little nauseated as well. She experienced lots of indigestion, cramping in her stomach like she was going to have a baby or the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot. She had a little bit of nausea. She had nausea pills because she had a gallbladder taken out and she took nausea pills for 2-3 days. She didn&#39;t take any medication for any of these symptoms she started to experience on Sunday. However, she did start popping Gas-X. She was taking two Gas-X every 3 or 4 hours. The caller states it helped. She had lots of gas; gas was just coming out of her bottom. She had the gas, cramps, her stomach hurt. She was able to get through it, which that is good. Then Monday, 01Feb2021 was the day she had weird things happen to her that she was kind of concerned about. Her muscles started to draw, that is the best way she can describe it. Her feet would just draw up weird. Her arms and hands would do crazy things and contort or draw up. This hurts because the muscles are like a rubber band pulling. It was weird, and she didn&#39;t like it. It wasn&#39;t like when she has a horse and has to get up and stand, it wasn&#39;t like that at all. Her muscles were tightening up like a rubber band. Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening. She thought to herself, &#34;what is this Parkinson&#39;s?&#34;. She doesn&#39;t even know. She still has some stomach issues, but it is easing up. The gas is still coming out. It wasn&#39;t debilitating or anything. She has some minor nausea. What scared her more was the muscle cramping and pulling. Her toes would contort and go backwards. The muscle tightness occurred yesterday, 01Feb2021. It happened all day and was sporadic. Her toes moved in a different way like a rubber band pulling on muscle. Nothing has happened today. Everything was yesterday. Her whole body basically was affected, just different sections at different times. Today, she feels like the left arm is going to do something, it&#39;s like the last to be pulled. Her hands and fingers stayed the same. She explains like the upper arm area from her elbow to her shoulder part. She can&#39;t even think of what that area is, but it&#39;s the part between her elbow and shoulder. She has been doing lots of exercises and moving, hoping the part of her elbow to her should don&#39;t atrophy or won&#39;t pull. She hasn&#39;t told anybody about it. She doesn&#39;t like it. It was very frightening. She is scheduled for her second shot and she is scared to death to go back. She mentions her nerves are shot. From stress, she had previously broken out instantly. She thought it was a bug biting her. She never had gone to the doctor but after about 4 weeks, she thought she had these horrible bug bites. She was shaking her clothes and she almost wanted to strip it was so bad. She thought it was severe bug bites. She couldn&#39;t figure it out. She finally went to the doctor after a week. It was a Saturday. The doctor told her it was shingles. Explained that it itches a lot. She went on medication. She clarifies she went on acyclovir 800mg, three pills a day. She called her doctor knowing that she had shingles and how scared she is with medicine, the doctor assured her she could get the COVID-19 shot as scheduled. The medicine for shingles (acyclovir) was finished up the Friday before she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shingles shot at 60 but everybody is now saying to get the new shot for shingles which she has never done obviously since she got the shingles. She plans to get the shingles shot in the summer. She is not worried about it. She took 3 pills a day and that was fine. She is fine, meaning every day she did normal things going through the whole process. She states she plans to go to the bank. She asked if anybody has reported the reaction she experienced after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. She received the first dose of the vaccine last Saturday, in which within an hour and a half her &#34;brain got weird, like a psychedelic feeling and it felt like I was getting an injection in the operating room to go to sleep.&#34; On Monday she experienced, &#34;horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band.&#34; Stated that it wasn&#39;t a horse feeling. Her hands and fingers would pull and contort in different positions, in which they would remain tight and stay in that position, and then she would be able to make a closed fist. On Monday night, her left arm contorted (which is not administration arm) and her muscle became really tight from her elbow to her wrist leading to her hand contorting as well. She describes the muscle tension as if a rubber band was being pulled, it would have burst. This muscle pulling hurt, in which she took 3 ibuprofen (ADVIL). She has crazy reactions with almost anything that she takes. She has never smoked or drank. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19: unknown on an unspecified date and unknown on Mar2020, SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of gas (flatulence), muscles became tight/contort, minor nausea, horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band and shingles. The outcome of the event &#39;the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot&#39; was not recovered while of the rest of the events was unknown.

Morning after chills, neck stiffness, pain back of head left side. Applied heating pad to neck. By late morning I was nauseous , and weak as a kitten. Took a 500 mg Tylenol and slept for about 4 hours. Woke up in a sweat but chills gone and am now able to eat a little bit. Back of head and neck still very sore.   The injection site is sore but no rash; right arm seems to have &#34;phantom pain&#34; as well ( I experienced this with Shingles shot in December 2020 too).

                                                On Feb. 12th at 2PM symptoms started with lower back pain, pain in abdomen and stomach, cramping, chills, ear ache, pain level 8.  Felt sick all over, like having the flu and then whole body ached, not just GI track.  Left arm injection site was red, sore to touch, swollen (slightly).  Doctor couldn&#39;t get vaccination needle into arm muscle the first time and so had to try a second time.   Intense cramping of GI track started up again 8:45AM on Feb. 13th.   By 4PM Feb. 15th fever 102F, chills, felt freezing cold and had to wrap myself in a heating blanket.  Pain level 10, especially in pancreas. Fever broke around 2:30AM Feb. 16th and later when I was up at 8AM I felt very weak, faint, pancreas ached.  Pancreatic pain lasted another 3 days.  Pancreatic pain stayed around level 5.  On Feb. 17th took ibuprophen.  Pain level reduced to 1.   This was the only time that I took pain medication between Feb. 10th and 17th, because I am conservative about using Ibuprophen, Tylenol, and have a high threshold for pain.

                                                Tingling of fingers and numbness of left cheek.  Did not get any worse after 30 minutes. Extremely tired and sore arm that day.  Day 2 - tired easily, no stamina.  Dizzy and nauseous after showering at3:30 pm.  By 10:30, both hands were red and itched.  Sometime in the night woke with a very sharp, painful headache.  Did not last.  No real problem again until Saturday.  Nausea at 11:20 am.  Sunday I sat all day doing taxes - no symptoms noted.  Monday after walking - rapid heart rate and very tired after what is normal activity.  By 4:30 I was tingling all over my body.  Tuesday night my ankles are swollen for the first time in years.  Only happened that nigh.  Wednesday morning, the tingling is very strong in my calves. and I had a sharp pain in the area of my Achilles tendon.  I believe that the vaccine has exacerbated the neuropathy (undiagnosed) of the bottom of my feet.  Today I am reporting because I fell for no reason getting out of a chair, and the tingling is in my legs, arms, shoulders.  I had not heard until today that the vaccine could affect the nervous system.  The effects are the worst they have been and it has been one week since I had the vaccine.  Should I get the second shot?  Due March 11,2021.

On the 6th night  after the shot, symptoms lasted about 8 hours. Then started up worse during the night of  the 7th day, especially the chills, elevated temp, fatigue  and nausea. Symptoms such as the chills are starting to subside about 10 hours later but some such as mild fatigue still remain. Is this normal for symptoms to show up nearly a week after the shot?

                                                Arm is slightly stiff; Muscle is slightly sore; Sore arms; just little tender; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 73-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included medroxyprogesterone and estradiol. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization (got the first shot exactly 3 weeks before for which the patient was not sure of the date). On 01Feb2021, just shortly after the patient and his husband both got the shot, the patient had sore arms by the time they drove home yesterday afternoon. The patient&#39;s sore arm was much better today but it was still just little tender - that is the only thing she had. Currently (02Feb2021), the patient&#39;s arm was slightly stiff still, just the muscle is slightly sore. No treatment was taken for the adverse events. The patient was recovering from &#34;Sore arms; just little tender&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

Morning after 1 PM second shot, my left eye was almost completely covered in blood.  My arm pit also very sore and found a bruise on the side of my left breast and also on my left hip.   I slept a lot and by the next day everything eased up.   After another day my eye was clear and bruises fading.  The last thing to go away was the soreness in my left arm pit.

She fell a couple of years ago and the doctor&#39;s x-rayed it and thought it was pulling away from the bone. They didn&#39;t have to do surgery. She was completely over that and it had resolved before getting the vaccine. Patient has no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medications included metformin hydrochloride, sitagliptin (JANUMET) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been taking it a long time over 20 years); glipizide taken for diabetes, start and stop date were not reported (been taking it a long time over 20 years); losartan taken for blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been on it about 10 years, her blood pressure is in between and it doesn&#39;t bother her a lot, it is not really high or low); and thiamazole (METHIMAZOLE) taken for thyroid problem from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been on it about ten years). Patient was calling because she had her first Pfizer shot about three weeks ago. About three days after on 06Mar2021, she developed pain in the right shoulder where she got the shot. It has been bothering her up until this time. She also had a pain over her heart area. The pain over her heart area occurred when she was breathing it. That has gone away. She had her second shot today and she was trying to explain to the doctor what happen to the right shoulder. He said the shot had to be in the other shoulder and he put it in the left shoulder in the bone. It hit the bone. She hollered because it hurt so bad. He said no one ever jumped like that before. She jumped because it hurt. She still has the pain in the right shoulder, but she doesn&#39;t feel anything in the left where she got it today. She clarified Pfizer shot as COVID19 vaccine. The pain in the right shoulder travels down the right arm. It goes down the shoulder and down the arm in Mar2021. She got first and second dose. She got the first dose of COVID19 vaccine on 03Mar2021. Pain in the right shoulder: it felt like her toothache has something to do with the pain in the shoulder. The toothache came on a little later (Mar2021) than the pain in the shoulder. The tooth ache is still ongoing, but it has improved. Pain over heart area: It started at the same time as with the pain in the right shoulder. The pain over the heart stopped about a week ago. She thinks she has recovered completely. She didn&#39;t have anything done for the heart pain. She got the second dose today, 25Mar2021, lot number: ER8733, Expiry date: unknown. The outcome of the events &#39;pain over her heart area and pain in the right shoulder travels down the right arm/it goes down the shoulder and down the arm&#39; was recovered, event tooth ache was recovering, and events &#39;pain in the right shoulder where she got the shot (vaccination site pain) and pain in the right shoulder&#39; was not recovered.

Took 400 ibuprofen about 4 PM day after injection to ease Reactions

                                                On 1/20/21 I had the 1st Covid 19 vaccine in my left arm at 1:10pm and at exactly 9:00pm that evening I experienced a pain on my right side that went along the outside starting at the base of my little toe and continuing to the heel of my foot and from there going right on up the outside of my right leg to the base of my hip.  At  this point I laid down which made the pain a little better.  I tried rubbing the area  but that didn&#34;t help much.   I did take one advil an hour before bedtime but the moderate pain stayed the same.  At midnight I went to bed and was able to sleep.  By morning I was fine.

The patient had her first dose on 19Dec2020 and had side effects from it but very few. The patient was worked at COVID rooms to clean rooms in hospital as a housekeeper and so her exposer to the hospital made her in first group to get the vaccine.

She had gotten the shot at 6 am, then worked at that time and by the time she got home at noon, she had massive weakness, some confusion, terrible sleepiness and by evening, she developed diarrhea. On the second day (08Jan2021) the pain increased the weakness increased, and she was running a temperature of 102. She could not even sit on the side of bed without falling to one side or the other or falling backwards so very weak and unable to move pretty much. She could not eat and lost appetite, and she developed the chills on that evening. On the third day (09Jan2021) she was running a temperature of 101 so it had gone down.

Only cold ice packs on the hives/ itching and no more treatment received for the events. The fever and itching resolved on 10Jan2021, and outcome of all other events was unknown.

By evening head movement was very difficult, I could not sleep in bed that night. I slept on the couch sitting up trying to immobilize head. During the night pain spread into the base of my skull. I applied heat to help relieve the pain and tightness. On 01/20/21 the pain (6 of 10) spread into the left side of neck and skull, it became difficult to eat, swallow and to get up from couch. I tried to sit motionless most of the day. On 01/21/21 the pain (6 of !0) moved down into my left rear shoulder, I continued to apply heat and immobilize sitting on couch, eating and swallowing still difficult. On 01/22/21 pain in neck and base of Additional information for Item 18:  skull subside to level 5, movement of head still difficult, able to to get up and move slowly. Could not lift head to drink, still needed to use straw. Slept on couch again this night.

                                                Began to get a stiff neck 5 days after vaccine was administerd. Excruciating pain the next day.  Could not get out of bed or bend over without supporting my head with my hands. Sought chiropractic and massage therapies on the 7th and 8th days. Beginning to get better, but still hurts. I can&#39;t say for certain that the vaccine caused this, but since I was not in an accident and had not fallen, I can&#39;t find another reason to have had such an excruciating condition.

A 74-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 20Jan2021 at 9:30-9:45 am at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included exposure to radiation from 2017 to an unknown date and did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017). There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included two doses of shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) for Immunization and experienced shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain after the vaccine. The patient experienced bad headache (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, Severe shaking chills (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, muscles and joints ached (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, couldn&#39;t hold a cup to drink on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, painful bilateral lower back pain on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, cough/dry cough on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of not recovered (reported as worsened), strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, taste started to diminish on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, pharangitis on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, couldn&#39;t get warm on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the patient received the COVIED in the morning of 20Jan2021. By 5pm she had developed a headache, severe shaking, chills, muscle and joints pain, severe lower back pain, and a dry cough; she was miserable. A few years ago after her double dosing of the shingles vaccine she had a similar reaction of shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain. She has no product details for that product, no NDC, Lot, or expiry to provide. The patient confirmed that the shingles shot was 2 doses, not a double dose given at one time. When asked a seriousness criteria it was explained that the symptoms that started on the 20th, she felt they were disabling. She couldn&#39;t get warm, stop shaking, couldn&#39;t hold a cup and the pain was severe and she has high tolerance for pain. By around 3pm that day on the 21Jan2021 everything but the dry cough had resolved, and that had gotten worse. She also developed new symptoms. She had strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic and her sense of taste started to diminish. She did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017, She has no product information, NDC, Lot or Expiry for that radiation but after that she did have taste, some of it did come back. On the 21Jan2021, it was less, the sense of taste and now today she has no taste at all. For the muscle and joint pain she took Aleve. She was told if she was feeling worse over the weekend to go to the ER or urgent care. The patient was wondering and thinking this was her normal response to the vaccine just like she had a normal response that shingles vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included sinus disorder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received a flu shot on an unspecified date. Consumer is calling about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, and says she just spoke to a nurse who told her to call and find out if her experience for what she had after her first shot on Friday of the past week had been reported before. She says that on Saturday (23Jan2021), she woke up and her right breast hurt, there is something in there, it radiates around to her back, along with having fatigue. She says she was told to see if anyone else reported this, she expected normal stuff like, flu stuff, this is not that. She says she is on her way to urgent care to have that looked at. She asks if condition persists, she is supposed to get her second dose on 12Feb, does she get it? She got her first dose last Friday (22Jan2021) then woke up Saturday and can&#39;t lift or pull anything and it really, really hurts. She says to add to this, which she talked to two doctors (docs) who said it was unrelated, that night she had a cut to the top of the roof of her mouth that had uncontrollable bleeding, she went to the emergency room for that and got a shot to help her coagulate blood, and will be seeing an ENT so hopefully that will be under control. No further details provided about shot to help her coagulate blood. She got the flu shot but that was Thanksgiving, way back, not recent. She is going to get her sinuses checked out, they did a CAT scan yesterday, and is going to the doctor for that 1Feb. She is concerned that the breast pain started last Saturday and is still really painful, she doesn&#39;t know why all of a sudden that happened, so she is going to the urgent care to see if they can do something for it, and will be getting an appointment with her OBGYN. For her right breast hurting, she took Tylenol and Ibuprofen, that is all she has done. Tylenol, LOT: PPAO33, EXP: Sep2022. Ibuprofen, LOT: 113132. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerised tomogram: unknown results on 27Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of she had a cut to the top of the roof of her mouth that had uncontrollable bleeding she had a cut to the top of the roof of her mouth that had uncontrollable bleeding and right breast hurts. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 29Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from two contactable consumers via medical information team. A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included dental work/specifying a tooth being pulled and an implant (an antibiotic (Amoxicillin)) was used and shingles (7 years ago). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that Pharmacist had some left over in the vial and gave the patient on 28Jan2021. Patient wanted to make sure it was ok. Patient stated &#34;she got shingles on her face, 7 years ago, and had recent dental work done,&#34; specifying a tooth being pulled and an implant. She stated she received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine last Thursday evening (28Jan2021). On 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 (friday and saturday), she mentioned, her &#34;arm was a little sore&#34;. On 30Jan2021 and 31Jan2021 (saturday evening and sunday morning) she said her &#34;upper back started hurting&#34; and thought &#34;maybe [she] sat on the couch for too long&#34;. On 31Jan2021 (Sunday evening), she added her &#34;back was very tender and sensitive around the spine area&#34; therefore, she &#34;took some tylenol and used a heating pad thinking [she] pulled a muscle&#34;. On 01Feb2021 (By Monday) she said her &#34;the back and front were very sensitive&#34; to the point where: when she &#34;touched [her] skin it felt like [she] was touching some live nerves&#34;. She explained seeing a physician assistant who &#34;couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on&#34; and since it seemed to be getting worst, she thought she could possibly have Shingles. She continued saying she then &#34;went to see an orthopedic doctor who took x-rays and said he doesn&#39;t see anything, and it may be the beginning phases of Shingles&#34;. She mentioned she has an appointment with her internist today at 4:20. She later mentioned her &#34;brother, who is a doctor, thinks [she] has post traumatic neuralgia&#34; related to her shingles on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

She was extremely anxious. Her initial blood pressure was 190/100. She reported being extremely scared of coming to the clinic today for the vaccine and that she got no sleep the night before. We talked extensively and I tried to get her mind thinking about anything else possible. Repeated her BP after a time and it was 142/82. Once her required 15 minute observation was over, she requested to leave, because  part of her apprehension was just being there. Her neck tightness has subsided.

Moments later, this was accompanied by throbbing pain in my lower back.  Eventually I was able to take my temperature and I had fever.  My daughter contacted my primry care physician who told us to go the emergency room. By the time we went to hospital, the chills had stopped as well as the lower back pain. I was quarantined (though they knew I had been vaccinated for COVID) until they tested me for COVID, the test came back negative in an hour.  They did a number of tests and I was discharged around 6:00 pm that evening

The patient previously took Flu vaccine (Injection site was left arm, intramuscularly) in Oct2018 and experienced pain in injection site and redness in arm; took the first dose of BNT162B2 with lot number: EL3246, intramuscularly in left arm site at 09:00 on 08Jan2021. Clinical course: After the second dose of vaccination, patient noticed tenderness at vaccinate site at 13:00 and had pain in arm on 28Jan2021, but on 29Jan2021, the pain was worse, and she had difficulty lifting her right arm at 16:00. On 30Jan2021, she started noticing more pain when she lifted her arm, her arm pits, it was hurting under arm when she was lifting. She thought maybe there were swollen glands but did not feel it. her temperate was 100.8, and she took some paracetamol (TYLENOL), by the evening, her temperature was at 98.6 normal. On 31Jan2021, she noticed a lot of pain, itching and redness, redness moved from actual site down her arm about 6 to 7 inches at 14:00. The pain in her right arm was not as bad as it was, but the redness in the area and itching was there, it was hot to touch area on right arm, and she tried cold compresses and took paracetamol. Also, it was hurting under her arm when she was lifting. She experienced something like that before with a Flu vaccine. She noticed when she looked it up, the information states, yes. And it was still going on today, not so much pain, just swelling and redness, looked like what Moderna calls a covid arm. She had no temperature, a little headache on 31Jan2021 at the back of the head and tired, very tired, she was tired from 29Jan2021, and was better from 01Feb2021. She took paracetamol last night, and cold compress. she used to take baby aspirin; she didn&#39;t know if it would be a problem. She read not to take paracetamol or ibuprofen before vaccination. She felt tugging and redness when she raised her arm, it was not red its blotchy. She didn&#39; t feel any swelling. The last 7 to 8 months, she was running high blood counts, 12.3 (high) and she had no infection, her doctor was a little nervous, the last one on 15Jan2021, it was down to 10.2 within normal range. Her immune system was very active. She had a flu shot in Oct2018 at age of 72 y/o and by 08Jun months later, she got the flu. She went to the hospital and developed PNA. In 2019 and again this past Aug2020, she had a Colonoscopy where they removed polyps. She had a flat polyp that was a little more dangerous the first time and it was removed. It was non-cancerous. The doctor was just watching it. Last blood results were 2 weeks prior to having first shot on 15Jan2021. The only thing that showed was her Liver enzymes were a little elevated. She was told that if she hadn&#39;t gotten the vaccine, it would have been worse, her doctor gave me the zpack. They were calling it a subcutaneous sensitivity, she had eczema, she forgot to mention that. She was taking calcium 1200mg, she forgot to tell her that also. The outcome of events pain in arm, redness and feeling hot was not recovered; of events tiredness, body temperature increased, itching and headache was recovering; of rest events was unknown.

A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 15:30 in left arm at single dose as Covid vaccine, etanercept (ENBREL, 50 mL/mg, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen, lot number: 1119808, expiry date: Apr2023) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 DF weekly to the stomach area for rheumatoid arthritis, methylprednisolone (MEDROL, tablet) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 3 mg, daily (1.5 tablets daily for total of 3 mg) for rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate (tablets) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 20 mg, weekly (2.5 mg tablets, 20 mg total) for rheumatoid arthritis. Medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity) and took levothyroxine, rheumatoid arthritis. She had had regular blood work for rheumatoid arthritis and that was normal for her, they were relatively normal and her ESR was down. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included levothyroxine daily for endocrine abnormalities. It was a daily thing for the body and the body couldn&#39;t live without it if it did not have it. The patient previously took the Shingrix vaccine and it was terrible for her and put her into a rheumatoid arthritis flare and was taking prednisone and was getting better and the wap she was in a rheumatoid flare. No prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient was taking 3 medicines for rheumatoid arthritis that might or might not affect the RNA in the vaccine. She wondered if etanercept would have an effect on the vaccine since it was shipped on ice overnight. She did not think they would affect anything. Nobody has said anything about the medications and she just wanted to get the vaccine. Her doctor knows nothing about the interactions and none of them seem to know if it is normal to have these symptoms 4 days after getting the vaccine. She felt great the first 2 days after getting the vaccine and then began to feel a little bad. She was having some symptoms maybe 4 days on 01Feb2021 after receiving the Covid vaccine and wanted to know if that was sort of normal. It was unusual for her, but she had nauseous, not dizziness, but unsteadiness, tired, also headaches and generally didn&#39;t feel well. She felt like she might have the stomach flu, but had not had that in so many years. She also felt weak. No temperature. Gentle muscle ache. On 01Feb2021 Monday night she had the nausea. On 02Feb2021 Tuesday, she had it again, and had it again today and almost threw up last night. Just the malaise or tiredness had gotten worse. She could not tell the difference between the rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain and muscle pain and this with the vaccine. She was having a few little odd pains, but nothing that she hadn&#39;t had before. It was more of a soft pain, they made her feel weak and then they went away. It was more muscle than joint. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was supposed to get a second dose but felt she shouldn&#39;t, it might put her back into a rheumatoid flare. She was just getting over it and afraid to go through that with the Covid vaccine also. The action taken in response to the events for etanercept, methylprednisolone and methotrexate was dose not changed. The outcome of events nausea, unsteadiness, tired (tired was reported as worsened), generally does not feel well, feels like the stomach flu, weak, few little odd pains; soft pain, joint pain was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

                                                February 17, 2021:  Patient received 1st dose of PfizerBioNTech vaccine.  Reported mild cough, nausea and bone pain lasting one week. However, she felt it wasn&#39;t severe enough to contact me as her asthma specialist.  No cough per patient for the week prior to the second dose of PfizerBioNTech. March 10, 2021:  Patient received 2nd dose of PfizerBioNTech vaccine at 1:10pm.  Said she had mild chest tightness during the waiting period and used her Ventolin but she attributed it to the characteristics of the waiting room area.  Between 5:00pm and 6:00pm (~4 hours later), she became light-headed, vomited and began to cough frequently.  She contacted her primary care physician who told her to use Mucinex and contact me if needed. March 12, 2021:  Patient contacted my office in the early afternoon.  Unable to stop coughing while on telephone.  Came to office approximately 90 minutes later.  Physical Exam;  Peak Flow 210 (personal best 310-320), oxygen saturation 93-95% (typically 97-98%), temp-98.2 F.  Intractable cough with scattered bilateral expiratory wheezes on auscultation.  Heart rate 132 and regular.  Patient treated with Levalbuterol 1.25 mg nebulization with subsequent modest improvement in frequency of cough, pulse 102, oxygen saturation 96-97%.  She declined going to emergency department of hospital because she did not want to get infected with COVID-19 from a patient in the waiting room.  She declined Prednisone when told that the corticosteroid might reduce the efficacy of the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  Placed on Budesonide 1 mg bid and Levalbuterol 1.25 mg q4-6h prn. March 16th:  Patient reported her cough was 70% improved and wanted to stop Budesonide.  Patient was told to continue Budesonide daily at 1 mg q day. April 5th:  Patient contacted my office because of continued coughing and wheezing.  Had been hospitalized March 25-27 for the cough.

                                                elevated CPK; Unable to raise arm; arm became sore; Muscle trauma/ some kind of damage either to heart muscles to the brain or some skeletal muscle on the body; Muscle trauma/ some kind of damage either to heart muscles to the brain or some skeletal muscle on the body; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reported for herself. A 74-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EP7534, expiration date: 31Jul2021, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left deltoid (also reported as left arm) on 21Mar2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; and rosuvastatin calcium, oral from an unspecified date (Lot Number: 20082811; Expiration Date: Jul2022) to an unspecified date, at 5mg every night for hyperlipidemia and Stage 3 kidney disease. Medical history included hypertension (diagnosed maybe 30 years ago, it is controlled), status ventricular tachycardia in 2001 (controlled), stroke (suffer stroke may be 12 or 13 years ago without the residual), Phase 3 renal disease/Stage 3 Kidney Disease, extracted tooth, bad tooth, aches and pain in her legs in Jan2020 and ongoing, and muscle pain. Patient did suffer stroke may be 12 or 13 years ago without the residual, it was incidental finding with the MRI with the brain because she had a bad tooth and they extracted the tooth, they decided to complain let&#39;s do a brain MRI of the brain and it showed an influx in right cerebellum but without residual she have no deficit, but they put her on Plavix first but the bruising was very severe so they changed it to Aggrenox which she successfully use Aggrenox now. Other medical conditions: Consumer stated, Folic acid, sodium bicarbonate, yes the Soda Bicarb (sodium bicarbonate) is for the Phase 3 renal disease but numbers are good, my DE creatinine all was normal but my nephrologist who happened to be a friend of mine said stage 3 renal disease. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole (AGGRENOX) taken for antiplatelet therapy, and paracetamol (TYLENOL) taken for pain. Concomitant medication: Consumer stated, &#34;I take lots of medication, I mean I take Tylenol but none these have a direct correlation to the, I take Aggrenox, Aggrenox is antiplatelet, oh you are a pharmacist so you know that, that&#39;s Persantin and aspirin that&#39;s the combo, its antiplatelet.&#34; Patient has no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient previously took clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) and experienced bruising; folic acid, and Soda Bicarb (sodium bicarbonate) for phase 3 renal disease. Patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EN6203, expiry date: 30Jun2021, on 28Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunization. It was given in her left arm. She received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Sunday (21Mar2021). Her arm became sore on 21Mar2021. On Wednesday (24Mar2021), she was unable to raise her arm even in the shower. She saw her doctor on Thursday because she is on a statin and had aches and pain in her legs. They drew blood and found that she has an elevated CPK on 26Mar2021. It is not grossly but is elevated and has had muscle trauma. Could there be a connection? She reduced the statin to three times a week. The arm soreness is 30-40% improved. She can move her arm away from her body. It felt like she hit her elbow in the funny bone. It was an odd feeling down to her fingertips. The vaccine card indicates the vaccine was given in her right deltoid but it was given in her left deltoid (Left arm). She clarified that she is taking Rosuvastatin Calcium instead of Crestor. She added that she has Stage 3 Kidney Disease. The Nephrologist had told her that she needed to take Rosuvastatin Calcium 7 days a week instead of three. She has only had the pain since she started taking it daily. She stopped taking it daily this past Monday night. She told her doctor she will be taking it only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Consumer further stated, she had a very sore arm that she cannot lift over her hand, it feels like somebody hit her elbow. Consumer further reported and stated that she had the Pfizer second vaccine on Sunday (21Mar2021), by Wednesday (24Mar2021), she could not lift her arm, she went to her doctor yesterday and she was a nurse for 54 years so she did not think that was big deal, vaccine do give you a sore arm. However, she drew blood, well she didn&#39;t, the technician drew blood in that arm and her CPK is elevated, Patient stated &#34;am I speaking to a pharmacist, doctor or, okay CPK indicated some kind of damage either to heart muscles to the brain or some skeletal muscle on the body. Mine has never been elevated, it&#39;s not growth fully elevated like indicative of cardiac event, However, it is elevated so I thought I should report this to Pfizer so I want you to know that, this is unusual finding.&#34; She was on a statin drug, she was on Crestor 5 mg once a day (clarified that she is taking Rosuvastatin Calcium instead of Crestor), however she cut it back to just 3 times a week now because her cholesterol numbers are good, my LDL and HDL are all good and the Cholesterol drug (Intent: Crestor) is known to cause this muscle aches and pain but this is so coincidental with this arm, her left arm where she received vaccine and this CPK being elevated and she thought perhaps Pfizer should be made aware. Consumer stated, &#34;I have been a nurse, I am retired now, I am 76 but I had been a nurse for 54 years, I was at one time director of nursing, so I am familiar with the healthcare system and most medications but of course this Pfizer vaccine and Moderna and Johnson and Johnson these are brand new, this is a Covid pandemic so. Causality: Consumer stated, I kind of think there is connection there sir, because remember that it could be, muscle damage that elevates your CPK, it could be cardiac muscle, it could be a stroke, neither which I didn&#39;t have a heart attack. I was having a lot of muscle pain, prior because of the Crestor but that is the common side effect of any statin drug can cause muscle aches and pains. However, I thought there was quite a connection getting the vaccine in the right arm, not being able to raise my (incomplete sentence) now vaccine was Sunday which was I believe the 21st and this event did not happen until, I was sore Sunday evening but the unable to raise it was Wednesday, which was 3 days later yeah and the blood draw was yesterday morning and this morning my doctor called me to tell me that my CPK was elevated not grossly but enough to make the phone call. Consumer stated, the first one was on 28Feb2021 and the lot number was EN620, I need my magnify glass, there is one right here because it&#39;s so small, okay its EN62C or is it 0, it&#39;s hard to tell 3 is the last number. The second dose with lot number is EP7534. Consumer stated, Let me just look at the calendar to make sure that was Wednesday, I got the shot on 21st, yes sir, it was the 24th, the arm was sore even that evening the 21st (21Mar2021), evening of the 21st but the inability to move it was Wednesday the 24th, I could not move even move it away from my body so I was guarding it, today it&#39;s not as bad, I can move it but I still feel it like up in my shoulder. When confirmed if the event has improved, consumer stated, I would say yes but not totally gone. Consumer stated, I just took Tylenol that&#39;s all, I mean what I was going to do, I think I took, I know I took a shower last night Wednesday at night, I might let the warm water run on it, I might have, I don&#39;t remember, I took a shower regardless so.&#34; Lab test: Consumer stated, &#34;I had blood work yesterday all my values were normal, Cholesterol was normal the only thing that was elevated was the CPK.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;I thought that it was necessary to report it okay, is there any way you can tell me is this a common occurrence where CPK elevates slightly.&#34; The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable and for rosuvastatin calcium was dose reduced. The outcome of the events &#39;arm became sore, unable to raise arm, elevated CPK and muscle trauma (muscle injury)&#39; was recovering while the outcome of the other event was unknown. The reporter considered the events &#39;arm soreness, unable to raise arm and elevated CPK&#39; as serious (medically significant). The causality of the events &#39;arm soreness and unable to raise arm&#39; was related to BNT162B2, and event &#39;elevated CPK&#39; was related to rosuvastatin calcium.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a drug event temporal association, the company cannot completely rule out a reasonable possibility that BNT162B2 caused the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

When she woke up at 8:30 AM her headache was very severe and was accompanied with very severe chest pain. She immediately took her to the ER. They did a very thorough work up to check on her heart and Aorta. They managed her severe pain with two doses of morphine followed by two days of Dilaudid. The imaging and symptoms left her with a newly discovered diagnosis of Pericarditis. The medical professions were sure this was a result of the COVID vaccine. They continued to treat her for a few days and sent her home with anti inflammatories to help. She continues to have muscle pain, weakness and shortness of breath when she walks. She is scheduled to take her 2nd dose on February 5th but we are very concerned and hesitant as we don&#39;t want to cause any more damage to her heart. The patient was hospitalized for events &#39;headache&#39;, &#39;chest pain;&#39;, &#39;pericarditis&#39; and &#39;pain&#39; for 4 days. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination and did not received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included imaging: pericarditis on 16Jan2021 and Nasal Swab: negative on 16Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events which included Colchicine and prednisone, morphine and dilaudid. The outcome of the events was recovering. The events &#34;headache&#34;, &#34;chest pain&#34;, &#34;pericarditis&#34;and &#34;severe pain&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and disability. The events &#34;myalgia&#34;, &#34;asthenia&#34; and &#34;dyspnea&#34; were assessed as serious due to disability. The events (&#39;headache&#39;, &#39;chest pain;&#39;, &#39;pericarditis&#39; and &#39;pain&#39;) resulted in emergency room visit.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient presented on 1/24 with acute onset weakness and numbness of the left leg so a stroke alert was activated. NIHSS 3. Head Ct and CTA head/neck were unremarkable. Not a candidate for tPA given on Eliquis. Initial exam was notable for weakness and sensory loss in the left leg, but a sensory level was also found to the umbilicus raising concern for a myelitis. Of note, the patient also reported that certain red colored things she looked at appeared black. Labs unrevealing- CBC, CMP unremarkable. ESR, CRP normal. UA and UCx positive for E. Coli UTI, she was treated with ceftriaxone. MRIs were done of her brain, cervical and thoracic spine which were unrevealing. On 1/25, her exam worsened including worsening weakness in the left leg and new numbness and paresthesias in the right leg. Reflexes were preserved. MRI L spine was done which was unrevealing. Lumbar puncture was done which showed 2 nucleated cells and mildly elevated protein at 50, but was otherwise unrevealing. IgG Index normal. No oligoclonal bands. She developed mild hyperreflexia in the left leg and continued to have a sensory level, now at around T5-6. Repeat imaging of her cervical and thoracic spine were completed on 1/28 which showed a contrast enhancing hyperintensity at T5. The patient was diagnosed with myelitis and she was started on IV methylprednisolone x5 days and sent to rehab. Patient is now significantly improved though continues to report some numbness in the left leg.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date (lot EL8982) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the right arm. The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 at 10:40 (at the age of 75-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included arthritis from an unknown date, renal cancer since 07Dec2020 and ongoing, atrial fibrillation since 2006 and ongoing,  partial nephrectomy on 06 Jan2021. She specified that she has an arthritis flare up about once a year and normally takes a Medrol dose pack.  The patient&#39;s historical vaccines included an unspecified flu vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) on an unspecified date about ten years ago after which she had to go to the Emergency Room for right arm redness, swelling at the injection site and face swelling on right side. She did not get another flu shot for 10 years but did get one this year in Nov2020. Concomitant medication included metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), flecainide acetate (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN, MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reports that she experienced a light headache. She clarified that she is in an unspecified program which includes an e-diary. As part of that program (app) she was sent a text every day for a week asking if she had any side effects; a couple times she had a headache.  On the eighth day (03Feb2021) she had a reaction where her right hand and wrist was painful and swollen. Caller states she couldn&#39;t move her hand without pain. Caller states she put ice on her hand Wednesday evening and this helped a little.  When ice was on her hand it helped with the pain but when it was removed it came back. She also reported fingers on right were all swollen and that she does have arthritis.  She further described the events as on Wednesday she started getting a little pain in her right wrist joint. She does have arthritis, but this pain was stronger, and her hand and fingers on right were all swollen in comparison to her other hand, and her knuckles seemed bigger. States that the pain got very strong and by the next morning she could barely move her arm; even though it was only her wrist that hurt, moving any part of her arm made her wrist her more, so she started icing it and took Tylenol for Arthritis 650mg Extended Release; she took it twice, one each time and reported that it probably didn&#39;t work. Caller clarifies statement about it probably not working; stating that she didn&#39;t notice a difference after taking the Tylenol.  She asked if these events, occurring eight days after the vaccine could be vaccine side effects or is this just a flare up on her arthritis that is unrelated to the vaccine. She added that she had been doing a lot of &#34;chopping&#34; while cooking on the night that this happened so that may have caused the flare up. She has a Medrol pack on hand for things like this (4mg tablets). She started it today and took two tablets before breakfast and one tablet at lunch. She states that it has already made a difference in her pain. She stated her concern, however, which is that she found that taking a steroid could affect the vaccine if taken before getting the vaccine, and right now she is in-between the two doses.  Her second dose is scheduled for 16Feb2021. She inquired as to if she can finish this dose pack without messing up the vaccine. The clinical outcome of headache was reported as recovered. The clinical outcomes of  hand swelling, wrist pain, hand pain and swelling of wrists were reported as not recovered. The clinical outcomes of arthritis flare up, swelling of fingers and could not move her arm were unknown.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 75-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 (age at the time of vaccination was 75-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure, osteoporosis and overactive bladder. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The previously had first dose (first shot) of BNT162B2 for covid-19 immunisation and had sore arm. It was reported that she is getting red bumps today (on 07Feb2021) on the part where she got injected. The consumer stated after second shot also, I had no symptoms except for sore arm on an unspecified date in Feb2021. The only thing that I noticed which was from second shot and which was really crazy is, once in a while I get this pain in my pointer finger in my right hand and that was it, it comes and it goes. But today, and in the last couple of days I noticed a little weakness in my right leg, but today when I went to work somebody said what is that big red bump on your forehead and I looked and there was a big red circle, there was a bump, like a real bump on my forehead. I didn&#39;t hide it, I didn&#39;t even think if it was allergic as I only had a banana before I went to work and a cup of coffee which I have lot of time. I am wondering if this bump that I have on my forehead which looks ridiculous and it is a big red bump, like a tumor bump, it feels like kind of sore when I touch it, is from the vaccine because I haven&#39;t had anything but the vaccine.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Main thing I am concerned about is the big red bump on my forehead.&#34; Treatment: Consumer stated, &#34;I never had that before, it is very slight. The main thing was the bump on my head that came today and I didn&#39;t have it when I left the house. I didn&#39;t hit my head or anything. I just took two Tylenol and an allergy pill in case if it was some kind of allergy.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 75-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6207) at the age of 75-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetic type 2 for probably 13-14 years, sleep apnea for 20 years (2001), arthritis in 2005 (probably 12-14 years), and blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure). Concomitant medications included metformin, sertraline, alprazolam, sitagliptin (JANUVIA), oxybutynin, insulin glargine (LANTUS), lisinopril for blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure), and cortisone for arthritis. The patient received the vaccine on 13Mar2021 in the afternoon and within 24 to 30 hours, the next day (14Mar2021), her right arm, where the vaccine was administered turned all red and swollen and her elbow also hurt. She went to the emergency room because she felt it was a reaction to the vaccine. They told her that it was a bacterial skin infection, an adverse effect of an initial encounter to the vaccine, arm swelling and bursitis caused by that, muscle pain and join pain in elbow and then she guessed it was like cellulitis. They gave her ROCEPHIN at the emergency room and then a couple days later, it wasn&#39;t getting any better and it was all the way down to her wrist. She went to immediate care center and received an antibiotic. She was also given 2 more prescription of antibiotics and told that it had to be administered with the antibiotics to get rid of the reactions. It has finally pretty much cleared up with the antibiotics if they hadn&#39;t put her in an immediate care and put her on intravenous medications. They were really concerned because it was going to get into sepsis or something. At first, the patient thought that it was just inflamed, then it was skin infection and then adverse effect from the initial encounter of the vaccine. She had been on the antibiotics for 10 days when it finally cleared, but the elbow was still sore and it hurts a lot, but the fluid was drained by an orthopedic doctor. She was given 2 different types of antibiotics plus a shot into her buttocks. It&#39;s a little sore because she was informed that &#34;the bruise have been flamed&#34; on Mar2021. When she went to emergency, first they give her 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched antibiotic to DURICEF and to BACTRIM DS, and advised to continue monitoring and if swelling and redness was progressive or worse, then go to emergency room again. She went to emergency room on 16Mar2021, the medicine given was doxycycline and then she was seen by an orthopedic physician today where the fluid was drained from her elbow but swelling and redness was progressively getting worst and she was feeling hot on Mar2021. So, she went to the immediate care. Overall, consistent to cellulitis of right upper arm strongly includes to go to the ER but the patient had something else and had to go right then. And then, she was given 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched to DURACEF and BACTRIM. She came back to the ER on the same day. It was kind of 2 things, like the redness and skin infection which currently was cellulitis. Doxycycline was what they told her to get, that&#39;s what they gave her at the emergency room, doxycycline hyclate. And then said to follow-up with her primary care which she did and that was on 17Mar2021. She looked at it and then they told her to see an orthopedic surgeon and she saw him on the 18Mar2021. They just thought that the antibiotics, that&#39;s why he gave her 2 different prescriptions plus the shot in the buttocks because he said if this will not be cured with the antibiotics, she&#39;ll end up in a hospital. And then it was raft and it took her 10 days to recover. And he marked little black dots to show where wasn&#39;t and if it goes beyond that then call us because it was spreading. The outcome of the events bruise and feeling hot was unknown, not recovered for joint pain, and recovered on 24Mar2021 for all other events. The events required emergency room visit/ physician office visit.
