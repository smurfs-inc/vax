Took 800mg Advil prn for about 4 days. Tonsillitis- Right tonsil was inflamed and sore . This started  5 days after the vaccine and lasted 3 -4 days. Used warm water rinses and gargled with Listerine As I am a Nurse with Rheumatoid arthritis , I know there is not much info about subjects with my underlying conditions . I just wanted to report that it did cause a flare in my symptoms but it lasted less than a week. I did hold my Humira for one week after the vaccine as I know it is a &#34;t-cell &#34; inhibitor and I wanted a good result from the  vaccine. I had my second shot today and can update you as to how things go

                                                At 4hrs post vaccination experienced extreme muscular pain between shoulder blades. The following week, as far as I can recall, I began to have tingling from the right shoulder blade down to my hand. I thought I may have a pinched nerve and went to the walk in clinic to be seen by the nurse practitioner that is in the same office as my primary. She examined me and thought it sounded like a pinched nerve and said I was swollen in the area of complaint. Cervical and thoracic x rays were taken (normal) and was told to take Flexeril and steroids. Pain was getting worse and primary told me to  begin taking  Meloxicam and have physical therapy. I have been doing both beginning 1-11-2021. Pain continues with no  improvement. Do not know if my symptoms are caused from the Covid shot, but just seemed to me that it was quite a coincidence that muscle pain began on the same day as receiving the shot.

A 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EK5730, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 16Dec220, at a single dose on arm right for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus 2, hypertension (HTN), migraines, back pains, hypothyroidism, and allergies to latex and kiwi. The patient received the vaccine at a military base. She did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. She had no COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications; she received other medications in two weeks. The patient previously took gabapentin and topiramate (TOPAMAX), in which she experienced allergies. On the second day after receiving the vaccine, 18Dec2020 04:00 AM, the patient started feeling left neck moderate to severe pain, and the pain started radiating down her left arm and down left leg, weakening her joints on those extremities. This continued severely for 3 days. At this time, she continued to feel mild left neck, shoulder and arm pain intermittently. She could not report this immediately due to not having her vaccine documents which she forgot at her workplace as she proceeded to vacation. She had paused in getting the second dose that was due on 07Jan2021, waiting to hear from Pfizer. The patient received NSAIDS and Muscle relaxant medications as treatment for the reported adverse events. Outcome of the events was recovering.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130. It started around 3:30-4:00 this morning (on 12Jan2021) and was mildly improved. she was feeling the chest pressure back pain had lesson, but had pain in the upper jaw, flu like symptoms on 12Jan2021. she said she could not get out of the bed right. She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears. She woke up about 3:30 with it. The headache now was all over head from front to back and comes and goes. Last time she went to work after receiving the first one and today (on 12Jan2021), there was no way she could go to work. She took TYLENOL when she got home because she was shivering and took more at 3:30 because she felt miserable because of her chest. She took 1 gram. Her headache did not go away. She got to sleep after she took the TYLENOL. Her back and jaw was bothering her. It felt like the flu. She had upper jaw pain and pain in her back. She didn&#39;t have a good back and just aches. After the first one, it took 10 hours for the shivering to start. This time it was very similar. The shivering started about 10 hours later, at 9pm on 11Jan2021.

Her thighs were burning at 03:30 on 12Jan2020. It was persistent weak and burning. She can barely walk. The areas that have hurt like when you get the flu, she was having now in the same places, so she thought it was from the shot.

She did not think it was a blood clot. It was feeling better. It was still sore but nothing like it was at 03:30. It is just an odd pain.

                                                Severe Left Leg, Hip and Lower left leg pain (Sciatic Nerve) it appears the vaccine may have irritated sciatic nerve pain.  Left left leg numbness.  Decreased mobility, difficulty sitting, walking, and even lying in bed.  Started very quickly without andy known injury.  Pain continued to worsen.  Pain even worse after second injection.  Now two weeks after second shot, the pain is going away.  It is like the nerve irritation is subsiding.  The way the irritation is subsiding makes it seem that the vaccination may have caused irritation to the nerve. After receiving 1st and continuing through the second vaccine, started having severe sciatica pain going down left hip and leg.  Left leg pain and numbness.  Thought I had done something to damage the nerve.  Hurt to sit, hurt to stand and even hurt when in bed. The pain was so severe it caused issues with any mobility.  Took Advil, Aspiring, Tylenol and nothing helped.  Received second vaccine 1/12/2021 the pain continued and even got worse.  It was to the point I couldn&#39;t even walk.  I couldn&#39;t figure out how I had damaged the nerve.  I am now thinking it was from the vaccine.  I believe the vaccine irritated the nerve.  The nerve pain is starting to go away.  Normally if you  have a sciatic nerve issue, it just doesn&#39;t go away on its own.  I know there have been reports of severe back and neck pain.  I believe it can irritate the nerves which cause severe pain.  I wanted this reported in cases others complain of similar issues.  The good thing it is improving.

Have had same symptoms as COVID but much worse after 2nd shot.  Symptoms started Day 4 after vaccine and continue today.  Running fever for 5 days now.  Still sick.  Flu test was negative although I doubted it was anything else since I rarely get sick and when I do it only lasts a day or two.  Will have a few hours where I finally think I am getting better and then another wave hits.

Then my arm pit was swollen, hot and the swelling went down my arm.  I also had diarrhea, Nausea, slight head ache, chills, body ache with a temp of 101.5.  Went to the doctor yesterday because of my armpit swelling, hot to touch and it had a red band.  She said where they gave it  was not in a muscle.  It was given sub Q &amp; that it went into my lymph gland and leaked down my arm to swell.   Right now I just have on and off nausea , pain in my lymph glands in my arm pit.  The swelling and pain has gone down and the other symptoms have faded away.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 60-year-old female patient started to receive bnt162b2 (manufacturer unspecified), lot number: EL4238, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 21Jan2021 15:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis. Patient&#39;s known allergies are Penicillin, Peanut and Dairy. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient&#39;s whole/entire arm was killing her; she was hurting across her shoulder blades down to fingers. Her elbow and wrist were hot and she was feeling a tremble in hand which she has never had before. She later added that her joint in elbow and shoulder was now reaching down to her arm. She couldn&#39;t even wear her watch today to her work, it felt swollen, like there was liquid in it. She also can&#39;t lift her arm, move and the pain was like going into her back. The patient was taking Aleve and Advil and &#34;it doesn&#39;t take away all but it takes away enough that she can function.&#34; She also bought a topical ointment to help numb the area and she was wearing a pain patch on my back. The outcome of events was reported as &#39;not recovered&#39;. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information on the batch/lot number has been obtained.

About a week and a half ago she began feeling numbness of her right leg going up to her upper abdomen with progressively worsening symptoms that have stabilized in the past several days. She also feels that her walking is off but cannot quite describe how or when it started. Exam notable for left-sided cervical myelopathy and decreased sensation on her right side up to a mid-thoracic sensory level.  Of note she has a first cousin on her fathers side with multiple sclerosis and a more distant cousin on her mother&#39;s side with multiple sclerosis.  Father with Parkinson&#39;s disease.  I see that COVID-19 biofire came back positive.  In light of this, COVID myelopathy is on the differential

Was swollen for 5 days, then fever chills, body aches (fever 0f 100.2)  Right hand was so painful was intolerable, truly had to wait for it to pass, nothing helped except for soaking in Epsom salt bath, which was short live.  Have had arthritis in this thumb but not for approximately 8 years.  Entire hand was swollen and not useable.

I could barely walk or climb in and out of the car, the bed, and had a very difficult time standing up from the toilet or a low chair or couch. No fever, but did have a few chills with teeth chattering at least twice.

                                                Received Pfizer COVID19 injection at 9:57 am on March 4 at the . As is usual for any shot or IV on me, I immediately tasted something weird in my mouth. It was not as metallic tasting as usual. More plasticy. Shot did not hurt.   Was told to stay in 30 minutes waiting area.I did. The taste remained in my mouth. I left at 10:34 am feeling OK, except for weird taste.  As I drove off the parking lot, I noticed that my mouth and tongue were tingling, with worst of it on my left side.  My throat did not seem to be affected, so I continued driving. Some nasal congestion and coughing.  The tingling turned into numbness in my mouth and tongue, all the way back to top of throat.  I called my primary care doctor at 12:10 pm and left a message.  I received a call back at 2:15 pm from nurse. She told me to take Benadryl and have someone take me to Urgent Care right away to get my vitals checked. I did not take Benadryl, as CDC said it could mask anaphylactic reaction.  I called a friend and she took me . I noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were swelling and painful.  We arrived at 2:45 pm. My vitals were checked, heart and breathing listened to and was checked briefly  for swelling in mouth and throat. There was no swelling. He said he had never heard of this tingling reaction and claimed it is just a side effect and not a serious reaction and that it would probably last a couple of days. He recommended that I watch for new symptoms and take Benadryl. That was $30. We left at 3:10.  We left. I noticed that the numbness was spreading to my lips and up the left side of face and I was getting super tired. Also, my mid to lower back started hurting a lot. I took a Benadryl.  4:30 pm still have same numbness. My eyes got super dry and itchy. My head started to hurt. Some coughing.  5:10 pm dry eye and numbness, more swollen lymph nodes and chills. Pain in calves, upper back, same on both sides.  6:38 weirdly, from the bottom of my thumb to halfway up my arm there is pain. Both arms simultaneously. Worse on the  left.  8:11 pm after bundling up and using a heating pad, plus extra heat, chills are lessened. Lymph nodes very sore in neck. Eyes are not quite as dry. Everything else is the same.  8:48 pm jaw really aches. Intestinal discomfort. Going to bed.  10:39 pm pain from jaw extended up into left ear. Upper part of throat hurts.  March 5, 2021  4:00 am. Body aches have lessened. Left arm sore at shot area.  5:45 am  eyes definitely dry, but not nearly as dry as yesterday. Numbness in mouth , tongue and face has lessened, but still uncomfortably present. Definitely worse on the left side. Little bit of tingling on the left, mostly on cheek from chin to ear. Headache gone. Lymph nodes sore and swollen .  7:00 am went on a walk. Noticed some achyness throughout body. Very tired.  10:51 am The tingling and numbness remain in my mouth, tongue and cheek up to my left eye.  Very tired. Lymph nodes still swollen and sore.

                                                Starting about one hour after the injection,  my left shoulder began to hurt a little bit.  As the day progressed the pain increased substantially into my shoulder. It then started to hurt on the left side of my neck.  I took Tylenol before bed, 500 mg is all I can take. This pain kept me awake all night and this morning I am not able to lift my arm up or down or sideways without pain, quite a bit of pain. Today is Sunday and I do not plan to seek medical care unless it continues to worsen. I will probably talk with my medical provider tomorrow if this continues.

                                                Since the week after the first Pfizer vaccine, I began struggling with symptoms of diabetes. I experienced extreme thirst, frequent urination and  I lost 17 pounds in the 3 weeks following the first dose. I never associated it with the vaccine, initially, because I never heard of any side effects like increased glucose, and my dad and sister have type 2 diabetes, so I was altering my diet, but the symptoms did not subside. I proceeded to get the second vaccine and that?s when I knew something was seriously wrong. That afternoon my blood sugar was 528, my vision was blurred, and I experienced a strange feeling in my heart. I was diagnosed by my GP with diabetes, and put on medication (Metformin and Glipizide). I proceeded to see an endocrinologist, I was put on insulin and after additional blood tests was diagnosed with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes , and Premature Atrial Complexes.

                                                On day 2 of the second dose, had  soreness, pain and swelling to injection site, also fever of 100.3, chills, body aches and weakness On day 4 after second dose had severe back pain, painful to walk, despite taking Motrin.  Went to doctor and had MRI done.      Then by early February started having insomnia, hard time falling asleep and staying asleep . I feel the second dose of vaccine might have caused my immune system to become over active.  The back is now ok after rest and physical therapy but the insomnia still persist.

                                                A few days after the vaccine on that Wednesday I began having pain in the upper shoulder and back area which persisted to a heaviness in my chest going into Thursday.   Thursday night I woke up in the middle of the night to the feeling of not being able to breathe. I laid awake for a while but dosed back off and it happened again a little later.   It felt as if someone was sitting on my chest which prompted me to go to the ER the next day.  Various test were done and I was admitted in the hospital for further observation. After admission I developed a massive headache which lasted from that Friday afternoon until that Sunday.  I was released on that Sat and the symptoms seemed to be getting better and by that Sunday evening all symptoms had subsided.

                                                As I pulled up for the 15 minute wait period the symptoms started 5 minutes after I received my vaccine.  A tingling feeling up my left arm to back of my neck. My neck stiffened and then my throat started to close.  Not to where I can&#39;t swallow but just like when I eat food that I&#39;m allergic too, it closes up. The nurse that was overseeing me was holding the umbrella over my car window with the rainfall.  All of a sudden their was lightning &amp; thunder. The nurse threw the umbrella because she was shocked from the lightning. She started to talk to all the other around her and forgot about me. Since I could still swallow I didn&#39;t get her attention. When she returned she asked me the time so I had to pull my phone out. She didn&#39;t know the time of my 15 minutes and sent me away. As soon as I got out of the parking area but still inside amusement park, I started to feel my cheeks becoming numb and my right eye was blurry.  I quickly moved over to the side lane still inside of amusement park and waited.  I called my husband and told him that with the heavy rain I didn&#39;t feel safe driving with my right eye being blurry.  I waiting another 15 minutes before driving home.  That evening the blurriness came back, my eye&#39;s &amp; forehead was tender to touch but no headache.  Only pressure in my head.  My symptoms of closed throat, swollen cheeks, pressure in my head and blurriness continued on Friday, March 12th, Saturday, March 13th, Sunday, March 14th and Monday, March 15th.  As of today, no other systems other than feeling my body has inflammation.

Around 10 am I developed chills and just did not feel great. My husband took my temp and the highest it got was 102.6 which is high for me since my baseline is 97.6 or so. I did not have a great appetite and felt very stiff when I moved around. I pushed fluids and took 3 naps Saturday. I have a low grade fever of 99 today but feel much better. Did take 2 naps and slept well last night. Took Advil with each meal and doing so today.

                                                8.5 hours after vaccine injection, I suddenly began experiencing fatigue and extreme joint and muscle soreness.   Initially I noticed my knees hurting with radiating pain up into my thighs.  My head hurt, particularly at the back of my skull, near my neck.  My neck muscles were sore, as were BOTH shoulders - my right shoulder (injection site) was only slightly sorer than my left shoulder.  I called a 24/7 nurse associated with insurance company to ask if ibuprofen or tylenol were acceptable treatments for my symptoms.  She told me I could take either and alternate if I felt I needed to maximize relief.  I noticed the joins in my toes and fingers were hurting.  It was frightening to experience tightness in my chest and back muscles.  I never felt like my lungs were compromised, there was just a heaviness as the muscles seemed constricted.  I felt a slight rise in my heart rate and experienced a few palpitations mostly because I kept pondering how much worse my symptoms could get.  I was a little cold, so I decided to go to bed after drinking extra water (also a suggestion from the nurse).  I slept for a few hours 10:00 PM - 4:00 AM then got up and called an advise nurse to report that my joint and muscle pain were not subsiding.  She encouraged water and more painkiller.  As the day wore on, I felt less achy and more shaky/jittery.  My thinking was somewhat unclear - I felt a little dizzy, out of balance, off-kilter and brain &#34;foggy.&#34;  As I write this 36 hours after my injection, my symptoms are subsiding.  Where I felt a little chilled during our cool and rainy afternoon, I now feel a wave of heat sort of traveling through my body.  It isn&#39;t a fever - just an odd sensation that something is still going on.

                                                By eight pm my left arm started hurting. At 2:30 am Sunday morning it was hurting so bad it woke me up. I could not raise my arm up past 6 inches. My left arm and side down to my waist was hurting. I took some Ibruprofen. Used a heating pad on my shoulder. Finally got back to sleep for a few hours. When I woke around 7:30 am, most of the pain had moved under my arm and to the front of my shoulder. I sat in my hot tub (100 degrees) for an hour and took more Ibruprofen. I was able to raise my arm up about half way. Was very tired. Went back to bed around 10 am and slept until 2:30. Had a headache and fatigue. Napped off and on the rest of the day. Today I can raise my arm all the way up, slowly. It is still painful to do so. The headache and fatigue are minimal.

Pain to the back of my neck, a flush of warmth to my upper body and difficulty breathing.  Felt like a truck ran over my chest.  I was weak, dizzy and nauseous as well.  The tingling sensation also affected both my legs. The RN took to their infirmary area and began taking my vitals.  Vitals seems normal, Blood Pressure and Pulse were high.  I am asthmatic but did not bring my inhaler with me.  Because of my difficulty breathing, they decided to inject me with Benadryl which is all they had.  After about twenty minutes, my breathing started to calm down and blood pressure began coming down as well.

                                                After I left the facility, driving home I notice that my back was starting to hurt, so I turned on the heat on my back . When I got home, I had difficulty getting out of my car.  I  sat in a chair and within the next few minutes I was not able to stand. My husband had to come help me get up and stand, there was pain across my lower back like pin needles and up part of my spine. I took Motrin and it helped it subside somewhat not much.  The second day it continued but later started to ease a little but I was not able to walk upright.  Third day, 3/24,  it is starting to ease up and I am able to walk upright, there is still discomfort.   I have contacted my physician to report the issue.

All symptoms improved within 18 hours except headache, which lasted for 36 hours. Headache was also a lingering effect after all other COVID-19 symptoms subsided when I had the virus, as well.

                                                I was submitting my events daily on website and two days it tells me my session has expired and won&#39;t let me report anything.  On Sunday night, March 21st, I started with very painful joint and muscle aches with fatigue.  The next morning I felt terrible and could barely function, I had a bought with diarrhea that lasted almost the entire day and had no energy.  I developed a large lump on my left clavicle area that seemed to be filled with fluid.  My knees I had replaced are still very painful today ( 7 days post vaccine).  I phoned my Dr. yesterday and they told me to take 1000mg of Tylenol 3 times a day.  I am doing this now for the second day with some relief.  I feel this is very unusual to feel this way 7 days after the vaccine.  On day 1-2 the only symptoms were a sore arm from the vaccine.  Saturday was actually a good day with no symptoms, the other symptoms started on Sunday.  I feel like my heartbeat is irregular also but my BP is good.  I would like to be able to to report daily on v-safe like I was the first few days.

Then Excruciating pain in shoulder and all down the arm from 3/19 and still continuing today 3/27. Took Tylenol and used ice on shoulder and arm. Had a massage and stretching done on 3/23 didn?t help much.   Contacted my doctors office on 3/23 and have an appointment for 3/31. The symptoms I?m feeling is that of SIRVA.   Went to urgent care on 3/26 and was told that ?that is a symptom of the vaccine, give it another day?.  Told them it was over a week and the pain I?m feeling is nerve pain. I was told there was nothing they can do for me there. Still feeling the pain today.  Still icing and using  Voltaren gel to help with inflammation.

                                                I experienced muscle and joint aches, headache and overall malaise.  Approximately 14 days after the first vaccine , started having vision deficits in my left eye out of the blue.  I experienced a fuzziness and haziness in the vision of the left eye and pain above the left eye brow.  Was seen urgently in the eye clinic on 3/29/21 and had a battery of tests - a swollen and inflamed left optic nerve was observed and some deficits to vision and peripheral vision.  Had second vaccine on 3/31/21 and eye seemed to get worse.   Seen by Optical Nerve Specialist on 4/5/21 and had battery of tests and optic nerve worse.  Dr. diagnosed as ischemic optical neuropathy likely due to giant cell artritis (GCA).  I had urgent/emergent temporal artery biopsy on 4/6/21 to determine if giant cell artritis.  Received results from biopsy on 4/13/21 and negative for GCA.  Saw Optical Nerve Specialist on 4/14/21 and diagnosed with ischemic optical neuropathy but cause can not be specified.  Optic nerve is still swollen and vision impacted.  I am to return to clinic in 8 weeks and see if improvement.  I have never had any issue like this in the past.

A 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot Number: ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Mar2021 at 14:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoporosis at least 10 years, terrible nausea, mild case of covid from Nov2020 to an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took alendronate from 2008 to an unknown date and experienced very sick, nausea, diarrhoea and zoledronic acid (RECLAST) from Dec2017 and experienced nausea and vomiting. On 27Mar2021 at 2:00, the patient experienced deathly sick, fainted, fracture of ankle/two fractures on her ankle, severely nauseous, vomiting, and diarrhea. On an unknown date, the patient experienced dvt blood clot, ankle was still swollen and uncomfortable/discomfort, the nights are the worst for the pain, pulse ox was low, and d-dimer was very high. The event, deathly sick, was life-threatening. The clinical course was as follows: the patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 26Mar2021 at 14:00 in the afternoon in her left arm. Twelve hours after the first dose, later in the night about 02:00 AM she woke up deathly sick; and severely nauseous. She remembered she was going to the bathroom then she must have fainted because they were taking her to the hospital. She went to the ER and they found she had a fractured ankle. She was not admitted to the hospital. She was in the ER from about 03:00 AM to noon the next day. There must have been something in there; she knew there must be something in the vaccine because of her reaction. Adds a few years ago, something like this happened before. She had osteoporosis and had similar reactions with other products she had tried for osteoporosis; she had terrible nausea. The other products she tried included: in 2008 she took alendronate, it made her very sick but not as severe as this time, she never fainted. She had nausea and diarrhea. Then in Dec2017 she had zoledronic acid. She went for an infusion at the hospital then went shopping, and was fine until the early morning, when she woke up with nausea and vomiting. In the ambulance, they gave her ondasetron (ZOFRAN) for the nausea so the vomiting stopped. With regard to her ankle, first they thought it was a DVT blood clot. They did the xray and saw actually two fractures on her ankle but she does not need surgery. She saw the orthopedic doctor the other day and he said her ankle was healing but she still will have no weight bearing for 6 weeks and she was in a boot. Adds her ankle was still swollen and uncomfortable. She hated to take medications and they gave her oxy but she didn&#39;t want to take it. She was taking ibuprofen but that messed up her stomach. The nights are the worst for the pain and discomfort. Doctor at the hospital and primary care agreed she should not have the second dose. She did have mild case of COVID in Nov2020 and they are hoping she had antibodies from the infection and the first dose. Her primary care doctor was reviewing the blood work she had done at the hospital and told her they were surprised the hospital didn&#39;t admit her for observation because her pulse ox was low and there was another test that she was questioning because the d-dimer was very high. They did a chest x ray with unknown results. The doctor was questioning why they didn&#39;t do something else to rule out a blood clot. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, deathly sick, DVT blood clot, fainted, fracture of ankle/two fractures on her ankle, severely nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea, ankle was still swollen and uncomfortable/discomfort, nights were the worst for the pain, pulse ox was low, and d-dimer was very high. The clinical outcome of the events, deathly sick, fainted, severely nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea, was recovered on 27Mar2021. The clinical outcome of the events, DVT blood clot and nights were the worst for the pain, pulse ox was low, and d-dimer was very high, was unknown. The clinical outcome of the event, fracture of ankle/two fractures on her ankle, was recovering. The clinical outcome of the event, ankle was still swollen and uncomfortable/discomfort, was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Apr2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: EW0ISO) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included she had lupus, sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications not reported. The patient previously took Pneumonia Vaccine on 04Mar2021 (Anatomical Location: Left arm); took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: the lot number starts with ER something and then it ends with a 3) as single dose for covid-19 immunization; took azathioprine for lupus and had allergic reaction; took belimumab (BENLYSTA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Lot Number: PV7G; Expiration Date: Jun2023, NDC: 49401-088-01, Number on the side: 0147098) to an unspecified date, self injection once a week for lupus. She gets it through the VA and it is subcutaneous use and the manufacturer is company. she was immunocompromise, she had lupus, so she was off of her medication (BENLYSTA) for a month per the CDC guidelines. She wanted to let Pfizer know that as well. For her first COVID vaccine she was originally scheduled to go 6 to 7 days after she had her pneumonia shot and they told her that she would have to wait 2 weeks before having her COVID shot and she did. Other than that she had followed the guidelines and she had been able to take her regular medications but she had to stop her Benlysta because of her immune system and everything. She had been following through on what the CDC has said. Patient stated that she just did a follow up with her doctor because of what happened after her second Pfizer COVID vaccine and her doctor recommended her to let Pfizer know about the side effects that she was having. On Friday 16Apr2021 she had her shot at 10 AM and it was no big deal, it was a little warm on her arms. She stated that it just looked like a bee sting and it wasn&#39;t super sore, it was warm to the touch and sensitive to the touch. It had big red spots and there has really been no change since it began. It looks about the size of a bee sting and it was still there. She had a little tiredness and she was not hungry but when she woke up at 06:40 the next morning (17Apr2021) on Saturday she was having severe dry heaves and vomiting bile and she could not get it under control. It had dehydrated her and she was having severe muscles aches. She had the severe dry heaves and the vomiting that lead to dehydration and then she went to the emergency room and she got replenished and they had given her something for feeling nauseous and eventually she was released 3 to 4 hours later. They gave her pills as well so she was doing well now and she hasn&#39;t done anything since she went to the emergency room with the vomiting and feeling nauseous. She went there about 1030 to 1040. Before she went she couldn&#39;t stop and she told herself that if it didn&#39;t stop on the 5th time then she was going to go to the emergency room and it got really bad so she had to call 911 to come and get her. Then she was having severe diarrhea on Sunday (18Apr2021) and the only way she could stop that was for her husband to pick up antidiarrheal pills. That only went away because of the medicine from the pharmacy. She had the over the counter medicine and she took Imodium. She hasn&#39;t been eating a lot so she hasn&#39;t had a bowel movement since she took that medication. When she had diarrhea there was no substance, it was very watery. And now today (unspecified date) she was having another reaction that she was seeing and it was just itching on her hands and her feet. She had been continuing to take the Benadryl and something that they gave her in the emergency room and she had taken Tylenol for the little headache that she has had. She had a slight headache and she was still taking Tylenol like they had recommended. This began the same time as she was vomiting on 17Apr2021 when she was going through all of that she had the slight headache. But her biggest concern was during this time when initially on Saturday (17Apr2021), her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, she was having the dry heaves her airway closed shut and she couldn&#39;t swallow to get any fluids in. Her concern was that the back of her throat was killing her and it was totally closed up so she had to go to the emergency room. She had recognized this because in the past she has had a medication where she had an allergic reaction (she thinks it is the medication that they gave her for lupus because she has been on several different things. She thinks azathioprine but she can&#39;t recall exactly but she thinks that might of been the one that did it to her) and it had closed her esophagus up the same way like this. This time it got worse to where she couldn&#39;t even swallow water no less a pill. This was on 17Apr2021. When she went to the emergency room they gave her the hydrocortisone to take it down and she actually had felt better while she was waiting for the saline drop. She was able to swallow when her airway was opened again by the time they treated it with the hydrocortisone. Around 16:00 she was better when she left the emergency room that same day 17Apr2021. She doesn&#39;t really have a sore throat, it is pretty fine. It seems to be okay she thinks that once the dry heaves and all that stopped it helped to relax that. She was a little raspy from the whole thing and she was struggling with having a dry mouth but that even had been resolved as far as her throat. She had no other reactions than what she explain but she also had a lot of muscles pain but that was to be excepted because it says that on all that she has read. She had had all of the reactions listed except for fever. She had had chills and then when clammy and then was clammy and had chills. She had all of those side effects listed on the sheet and when she went on Saturday following her vaccine to the emergency room most of the side effects were treated in emergency room. They gave her Pepcid, hydrocortisone through her IV and gave her Zofran for the vomiting and they said to keep taking acetaminophen. They gave her cetirizine for allergy or the itching or whatever and they also gave her famotidine which she thinks is Pepcid. Since being off the lupus drug she was getting her symptoms again such as sensitivity to light, inflammation and the dry heaves didn&#39;t help so under her eyes it was swollen and she just takes it as it was because she was not on her medication and she had something else injected inside of her. Also, she had Sjogren&#39;s disease too so her eyes were already drier than normal and she had had puffiness since 17Apr2021 when she was vomiting. She just wanted to make sure that Pfizer got that information because she didn t see that listed. The only side effect she was related was the swollen glands and she has glands in her throat but she wanted to be sure that Pfizer had that data just in case if it could help someone else. Again, she wants to reiterate that with her first dosage she had no problems. She couldn t even see the mark and all of this is stemming from the second dose of the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#34;Dry heaves, Bilious vomiting, Dehydration, Her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, Unable to swallow, Dry mouth, Nauseous&#34; was recovered on 17Apr2021. The outcome of events &#34;Feeling of warmth, Vaccination site pain, Hyperaesthesia, Vaccination site erythema, Tiredness&#34; not recovered. The outcome of the event &#34;Headache&#34; was recovering. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                The first thing I had nausea and stomach pain (for 2 days) in the AM and then it went to achy, joint hurting and headache. It was not like I could not work or anything, it was just there.  On the 9th day I woke up with fever and chills and a super bad headache and I felt so bad I could not even go seek medical care, I finally went after 3 or 4 days feeling like that. At the walk in clinic they tested me for flu, covid and strep and on the rapid the result was negative but when done the PCR it came back positive (around 12/29/20). I did not have any respiratory issues on this one. I do remember having diarrhea.

A 61-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 18Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been otherwise well prior to receiving the bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020. Within 72 hours, she experienced fatigue, body aches, chills and sweats since 21Dec2020, though she was able to work Xmas week. On 31Dec2020, she contacted her PCP to report neck and leg muscle stiffness and pain, difficulty ambulating, fatigue, chills and sweats. She had a negative COVID test on 02Jan2021 and essentially negative blood work, other than an ESR of 124 mm/hr and CRP of 4 mg/dl. I had a negative PET scan on 12Jan2021. Currently, she had pain/stiffness in her neck and legs, and progressive difficulty w/ ambulation (both of which are worst in the early hours of the AM), and difficulty with ADLs since 31Dec2020. She had been unable to work since 03Jan2021. Her physician had not indicated or endorsed any relationship between her symptoms and the vax. She forewent dose 2 out of an abundance of caution. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events muscle stiffness , neck pain and gait disturbance appeared 13 days after administration of single dose BNT162B2. The Company considers that the events are less likely related to suspect BNT162B2 injection given the weak time association. The detailed clinical course and cause of the events would be helpful for further assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Getting my 2nd dose today. I have paperwork from Pfizer that I need to fill out for their data keeping.  Pain was excruciating for nearly 2wks and started to settle down a few days ago, where I don?t have to sit with a heating pad or take motrin and flexaril.  f/u 1/28/21-&#34;My neck still hurts, worse on certain days, but is bearable. I haven?t had any imaging done and just heard of another person with same symptoms. My 2nd dose was fine. No pain at all, not even at injection site. I will keep you posted if anything changes. I?m hoping it will just go away on it?s own. I?ve heard it takes months&#34;.  Referred employee back to PCP.

                                                (This is a duplicate entry. I mistakenly entered that patient received the Moderna vaccine, but she in fact received the Pfizer.)  I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine late last Wednesday afternoon (1/20).  Before the 2nd dose, I premedicated (as instructed by my medical office) with Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg (for the histamine blocking effect) since I had terrible itching for about 36 hrs after the 1st dose; but the itching didn&#39;t begin-after the 1st dose-until about 8hrs after the shot &amp; became intense 2 more hrs later.  I had itching the night of the 2nd dose that kept me awake part of the night but was FAR less intense than after the 1st dose.  I came to work Thurs not feeling ill--just cold and tired all day (I attributed to the cold weather and not sleeping well).  Thurs about noon I began feeling ill--like I was coming down with the flu; I went home after my shift and found my temp to be 100.4.  Shortly thereafter it was 100.9.  I thought it would pass by morning so I just showered, drank fluids, took Tylenol and slept.  By 0200ish Fri 1/22 I still had a fever of 100.9 (even with Tylenol on board), a bad headache, sinus congestion, and significant neck and back pain so I called out for work.  I continued to treat the fever and by noon Fri the fever finally had resolved-along with the head, neck and back pain. I&#39;ve been fine since.

                                                I am not sure this is what i shoud be filling out - just wanted to report what seemed like pretty bad symptoms on first dose by all info i have found. The actual shot was given by another facility than listed previously. I recieved the first dose of Pfizer at  Health Dept . No other location information was provided by them.  When i got the shot, a blood vein and possibly a nerve was hit. The nurse did everything properly i think to correct and notify other RN. It caused immediate pain in left fingers and arm felt heavy. That continued for days, but not too bad and injection site itself really was not very sore. My concern was how sick I felt starting within 6 hours of the injection and how long it lasted. I had pretty much instant nausea- no vomiting- mild but persistant, severe fatigue and general overall uneasy/sick feeling. Joint pain started within the 6 hours, along with a few odd pains in neck and right abdomen.  Was extremely chilled for hours, pretty bad tension /tight feeling headache, jittery feeling and foggy. I took a 500mg Tylenol about 8 hours after the shot, and it helped to relieve most symptoms to a degree that was nagging, but tolerable. I pretty much went through this for about the next 3 days and off/on to the 5th day

                                                Initially after injection I felt as if a rapid heart beat (but 60 minute pulse count was no more than 80 and was regular). Discomfort in arm began, progressed to inflammation and difficulty in movement of arm especially to lift arm.  Used Tylenol or Motrin PRN for relief as well as heating pad intermittently.  After 1/23 injection discomfort seemed to lessen but on 2/9 (4 days before second injection due) discomfort still persists.  Due to persistence of symptoms seen in Urgent Care diagnosis Adhesive Capsulitis of right shoulder and acute pain of right shoulder.   Treatment, Physical Therapy and Ibuprofen. Unable to use steroids due to diabetes. Follow up scheduled 2 weeks 2/16/2021.

                                                The next day, when I woke up I was unable to stand on my left leg. Pain in the posterior knee. Felt like I was walking through mud. Joints were all loose. Just a really bad left knee pain. They  a lower extremity doppler to that leg - to look for blood clot and that was negative. Physical therapy - taped my knee; pain was so bad I had to stay home a couple of times. My hands (both) were so painful. Like I had frostbite. Occupational therapy did hand massage and paraffin for the pain. And isotoner glove at night and that helps with the buzzing. I am 2 months out today from the vaccine and I&#39;m starting to feel like normal. Took two months to fade away. It may have been because I was still having COVID antibodies. COVID antibodies on August started at 6.95. I&#39;m not totally recovered right now but I&#39;m close to normal.  Doctor visit - January 29, 2021 and February 5, 2021.and February 19th.  They put me on high dose of Steroids - 20 mgs Prednisone daily  and another round of blood thinner -ELIQUIS  mg which helped me with pain and joints.

A 61-year-old female patient received their first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 20Jan2021 18:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and high BP from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine, losartan potassium and sodium fluoride (CREST CAVITY PROTECTION). The patient previously took septra and experienced allergies. The patient reported that on 21Jan2021, they woke up and brushed their teeth then at 6:40am blood with large clots gushed from their right (rt) nostril. The patient went to ER and stopped bleeding after 2 hrs. On 22Jan2021, the patient woke up with bad headache, winded, vomited, diaherra (as reported), coughing. On 23Jan2021, they went to get covid test but due to blood in their nose, they received antibody test which was negative. On 24Jan2021, the patient was still feeling bad with all the above symptoms. Then on 25Jan2021, they went to ENT doctor who cauterized their nose and stated that since antibody was negative to take the maderna vaccine since they have no antibody in their system, the Pfizer vaccine did not work. From 26Jan2021 to 13Feb2021, the patient felt same started feeling better 14Feb2021 but still have sore muscles in their shoulders and cough. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 antibody test: negative on 23Jan2021.  The action taken in response to the event(s) for bnt162b2 was not applicable. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of epistaxis and clot blood which include the doctor cauterized their nose. The patient recovered with sequel from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the epistaxis and other reported events  due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including CBC and coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Following the first Covid vaccine, these symptoms increased. I was unsure whether this increase was due to the vaccine. However, following the second vaccine, my symptoms increased again and are substantially more severe than they were prior to the vaccine. I am also having increased pain in the area of my liver following both doses.

Hip pain continues worsening with walking and standing over time.  Hips started to ache after first vaccine but didn&#39;t realize it was attributed to vaccine.  Started taking fish oil and Glucosamine tabs for joints.  Hip pain after 2nd vaccine increased and continues today.  Went to Internal Medicine clinic to be seen on 1/25/2021.  Xrays, UA, ANA, CBC and CMP were done.  Xrays show mild degenerative changes to hips bilaterally.  ANA elevated at 2.1.  Everything else within normal limits.  Physician then added RA, C- Reactive Protein and Sedrate, all coming back WNL. Will be making appointment with Rheumatoidologist.

                                                I felt a shooting pain immediately from my arm into my shoulder area, and then felt itching and had  a slight rash on chest area. When checked to be released, upon mentioning the rash, they checked my blood pressure, which is normally in the 90-100/68-70 range (low!) and it was 138/80.  Sounds normal, but I?ve never had a blood pressure reading that high!  I felt ok enough to leave with my husband, but later got dizzy, nauseous  and throughout the day my joints (neck, shoulders, arms and legs) got increasingly painful, to the point where I could barely climb the stairs that night without assistance.  Note: I run 5K every other day and bike or walk on off days, so I?m pretty active.  I took Tylenol and went to bed early and was stiff, but better the next morning.  Made myself get outside for a light run and was basically fine (albeit very tired) the next day.  First day was a little scary though.

                                                I am on infusion for severe psoriatic arthritis, and was doing well. Two days after injection it was as if the effects of my infusions were cancelled. Extreme widespread stiffness, pain, joint swelling and heat, muscle weakness and pain. I also had swollen lower lip and have had an increase in headaches and nausea. Two weeks after the injection I awoke with my right arm swollen, hard, and itchy. The arm and my lips have resolved, but I am still having all the other problems. I have reported these symptoms to both my primary doctor and my rheumatologist.

It felt like the stiffness was creeping up my neck. After about a hour I felt my ear lobes tingling and the left side of my face in the jaw area  seemed a bit swollen and felt a little numb. It resolved and I had only a sore injection site the next day and no other symptoms. I&#39;m wondering if I should be concerned about getting the second shot

A 61-year-old female patient, not pregnant, received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 02Feb2021 14:30, at a single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes, high blood pressure, and sciatica. Concomitant medications included insulin glargine (LANTUS); metformin; hydrochlorothiazide; candesartan; glipizide (GLIPIZIDE XL) and; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) - all taken for unspecified indications with start and stop dates not reported. The patient previously received sitagliptin (JANUVIA) and experienced allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the Covid vaccine. The patient did not have Covid prior vaccination. The patient received the vaccine in a public health clinic/veterans administration facility. The patient received the Pfizer vaccine dose 1 on 02Feb2021. The patient experienced nausea, chills, diarrhea and bad chest pain could barely breathe - these have passed. Her left arm where the injection was given was very painful from the injection site to her wrist and she has been alternating ice pack/heat pad and taking Tylenol 650 mg for the pain. She can barely lift her arm over her head. She also noticed an increase in her blood sugar and her blood was really dark - she stated this was unusual. She asked if there was anything she can do or take that might decrease her arm pain. All the adverse events happened on Feb2021 and resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was reported that the patient had not recovered from all the adverse events at the time of the report. No treatment was received for all the adverse events, except for &#34;left arm where the injection was given was very painful from the injection site to her wrist&#34; (alternating ice pack/heat pad and taking Tylenol 650 mg for the pain). The patient has not been Covid-tested post vaccination.

I was sitting in my living room watching TV and a sudden severe pain shot through my chest and followed by tightness and difficulty breathing. It was immediately accompanied by a pain between the shoulder blades, cold sweat, nausea, then neck pain and faintness along with the uncontrollable need to move my bowels which was in diarrhea form and continued 3 times within 20 minutes with the other symptoms. After about 5 minutes of receiving the onset of the initial shocking pain, the intensity of the chest pain left but the tightness remained and faded but would return and then subside again every 10 minutes.  I went to the emergency room at 11:20pm discharged at 2:50am on 3/19/21.

I was very weak and at times was unable to get out of bed or stand.  I had significant joint and overall body pain, at times unable to stand up straight.  As this subsided about 36 hours I remained quite weak.  On the night of 16 March I was woken up at 1 am with a very severe headache.  I took Tylenol and 5 hours later still had the headache - it subsided after about 8 hours.    I additionally had stomach cramping but no vomiting or diarrhea, and  had no bowel movements until the episode cleared up.    During the 4 days that this occurred I tried to keep well hydrated but still had quite concentrated strong urine.  I took Tylenol periodically throughout the 4 days, not starting until after the injection was administered.  I still feel a little loss of balance/brain fog and have recurring headaches (not migranes).

That evening, I was really tired with body aches.  That night   I had deep body aches and vomited.  I also had a slight headache and coughing.  The worst part was the extreme body aches.  I felt like I had been hit by a truck.  On Saturday (shot was on Thursday), I?m better but my body is sore and I don?t have much energy.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 05Mar2021 1:45 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the BNT162B2. Medical history included allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, brain barrier fever, epilepsy, encephalitis and meningitis. She had epilepsy as a child. She gets epilepsy when she gets sick. The last 4 times she got sick she had a seizure. The last seizure was 1 year ago (in 2020). She may have had COVID, but she got really sick and had a seizure. She is not sure if it was COVID or not. If it was the flu, she does not want that again. She had ataxia and ended up in hospital two times but did not stay. Prior to this, she did not go to hospital for 30 years. She was unable to walk, her gait was real bad. The neurological disorder messed her up for a while. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient received the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE first dose and experienced autoimmune response. After the vaccine, she had pain and tingling sensation from head to her to spine (05Mar2021), BP dropped to 70/40 (06Mar2021), seizures (06Mar2021), and delayed allergic reaction (Mar2021). She wanted to know if she should take the second dose or not. She also wanted to know if that would be considered the anaphylactic reaction. It was also reported that the patient experienced funny taste in mouth, back pain, hands tingling on 05Mar2021. The patient further explained that when she got the shot, she had a funny taste in her mouth. It started immediately after she got the vaccine and it lasted 30 minutes. She mentioned this to the people at the facility, but they said she was crazy and no one else has mentioned this. She thought they would be interested, but they did not care. About 20 minutes later she had a tingly sensation. It was in the back of her head that developed into a stingy, painful, heat, funny type feeling. It was all the way down to her back. She later further explained the back of her head was tingling (05Mar2021). Like were the cerebellum is to spine. This sensation is still there, but better. After she felt this feeling her back then started hurting. She bent over and her back went out. She felt achy. She already had what she called a tweaky muscle (05Mar2021). She had pulled a muscle in her back, but it was nothing that had caused a problem. After getting the COVID vaccine it triggered an immune response in her body. She started to have pain at the top of her head down to her hip (05Mar2021). She bent over and she could not stand up (05Mar2021). Her husband had to help her put her pants on and sit down due to this. She started to have horrible back pain (05Mar2021). She could hardly move (05Mar2021). She was having trouble walking (05Mar2021). She was having trouble holding her urine (05Mar2021). On Saturday evening (06Mar2021), her blood pressure started dropping and she later had a seizure. After the seizure occurred it seems like everything got better and she did not have any trouble since. It was very scary. She mentioned she was in the bathroom and there was a tub full of water. She had a hard time already getting to the bathroom. She was in a lot of pain. The amount of pain she had she thinks affected her blood pressure. She had pain in the back, middle of her back. It started at her head, back of head, down her spine, came down to her back and hips. She was hurting a lot and having a terribly hard time getting around. She could hardly walk. She was going to the bathroom because she felt like she had to go. Her husband was helping her sit on the toilet. When she stood up it was like her blood pressure dropped, she almost went headfirst in the tub full of water, but her husband caught her, laid her down, and had a seizure. This was a very unnerving feeling. The seizure did not last more than a minute, maybe two at the very most. The seizure occurred probably around 6PM or 7PM. It did not last long at all. She woke up on the floor. She had been sitting and she thought she had fallen off the toilet. However, her husband had to remind her that a few things happened in between. She almost fell in the bathtub and she has glass doors. She mentioned she felt as clarified and confirmed sped up. She did fall into a cabinet and is bruised up from that seizure (06Mar2021). She is sore from the pain from that. Still inflamed (06Mar2021) possibly due to the seizure. Like she has ruminants of what occurred to back of head, cerebellum. Before she had the seizure, her blood pressure had started dropping. It started dropping in the evening around 5PM or 5:30PM. Mentioned she is a little confused about the time onset because she was hurting so much and bad all day. She does not take any pain medication. She has an autoimmune disease and it is difficult for her to take medications. On top of that, if she wanted to take an Aspirin she was told she should not take one. She was informed she was trying to promote an auto-immune response to the vaccine. As the day ran on, she was in a lot of pain. She had been in pain since Friday and was trying to deal with that. The patient further stated her blood pressure is back, no illness. After the seizure her blood pressure went back to normal and at this time it is perfectly fine. The back pain she experienced went from the brain down to her backbone. The pain is gone. It started to go away after the seizure and by Sunday 07Mar2021 it was totally gone. At first it was like she could not walk (05Mar2021). It was like she/her back was on fire (05Mar2021). The patient also mentioned if she moves her head quickly, she can feel like she will have a headache, hangover. She feels it in her back. She feels like she is near recovery, and this is a feeling she does not thing will stay. She further went on to say her hip where she fell is a different story. However, this is associated to a fall and not a vaccine. She was having this problem when she had the vaccine, but the vaccine caused it to be more and extra aggravating.  She later added, when she first got home along with head tingling her hands were tingling as well. When her brain and hands were going through this tingling sensation, she started to notice the back trouble and it was also in her abdomen area and in her legs causing trouble walking (05Mar2021). The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events trouble walking, could not walk, tingling sensation and hangover was recovering. Outcome of BP dropped to 70/40 was recovered on Mar2021. Outcome of seizures recovered on 06Mar2021. Outcome of funny taste in mouth was recovered on 05Mar2021. Outcome of back pain was recovered on 07Mar2021. Outcome of bruised up was not recovered. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient provided an unrelated causality between the vaccine and event fall.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Fall is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.

                                                I had swollen and very, very painful - the muscle on top of my shoulder (Trapezius) on the right side and I took Advil late at night time because it was so painful I couldn&#39;t sleep. My arm was not sore but that muscle was.  That seemed to calm it down (Advil). The next morning, I was very swollen under my right armpit - I figured it was my lymph node. It was uncomfortable and very noticeable - quite swollen for three days. It took about a week to go back to normal. I also had abnormal fatigue and that took longer to resolve - that took about two weeks to be resolved.

                                                On 3/22/21 I experienced several bouts of diarrhea coupled with clammyness/sweating/heart rate of 102. On 3/22/21 and continue to have swelling in my left armpit (Lymph node area), spasms in my left shoulder blade and surrounding soft tissue adjacent to my left armpit and neck area.  I have experienced soreness in that arm/shoulder but not at the injection site - overall bicep and clavicle area. I have been able to alleviate symptoms to a degree by taking a tylenol once or twice a day but the pain is limiting some of my daily activities to a degree.

A 61-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EM9809), intramuscular in left arm on 10Feb2021 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis and kidney issues. Concomitant medication included insulin. The patient had the first COVID-19 vaccine. She had a lot of issues wrong with her, however she did not have them hit her at the same time. It was currently the 9th day since she had her first shot. About 4 or 5 days into it, the wound on her leg started to get worse. She had rheumatoid arthritis and she had an RA attack. She had herpes, but she did not had an outbreak in a couple of years. She got blisters in her mouth, and this also hit her. She explained everything hit her all at once. She was now on antibiotics for each one of the things. Her doctor figured out that her body just couldn&#39;t handle it. She clarified putting the vaccine into her body, she couldnt fight off everything. Like whatever in in the vaccine and how the vaccines works, her body was just not strong enough to fight off everything at the same time. The patient did not went to the emergency room. It was reported that the patient would receive her second dose on 03Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.      No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                I experienced a slight headache  sore arm and elevated blood pressure after the shot. My blood pressure is usually very well controlled. On Monday the 29th, at about 3:30 pm, I started to slur my words. At first we blamed it on the Novocaiine earlier in the day, but I had been talking fine after it and had had it many, many times before and it was worn off. We called my doctor&#39;s office after my right arm and leg became very heavy and awkward. They told me to go to the nearest hospital. When I got there, I presented ass a full stroke. I was very hard to understand and my mouth drooped and I had very little use of my right arm and leg. They ran tests, but could not give me the medication because I was already on Eliquis. They thought they saw a small clot very high up. I was hospitalized over the next four days and improved my speech dramatically after a bad headache on March 30. The doctors go back and forth to whether it was a Acute Ischemic Stroke, which is what my paperwork says and a complex migraine. I do not experience migraines or anything like this ever before.  I did not have a real headache on the 29th. Since my symptoms, right arm and leg difficulties are still here, my Doctor believes it was a stroke. I have an appointment with a Neurologist and I have to have another MRI. I am going to Physical Therapy. My Doctor told me to fill this out, she thinks it may be from the vaccine.

A 61 years old female consumer received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; NDC number 59267-1000-01) on 29Mar2921 at 14:15, in left upper arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same date or within 4 weeks. Medical history included allergic to hamsters (she found out that this one had the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and she knew she had problems with those things), allergic to prednisone (crazy rash, itching), allergic to a lot of different things, sinus infection. Family history included allergy (the whole family had allergies). Concomitant medications included unspecified antibiotics for sinus infection (but it had cleared up by then) and unspecified allergy shots (but not a vaccine). The patient just wanted to report that she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Symptoms began minutes after getting vaccine. The patient experienced getting lots of saliva started with a couple of minutes of getting the shot, tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, couldn&#39;t control her breathing, heart rate it got faster, started getting confused, shaky, wheezing, swelling of her throat, blood pressure dropped, all on 29Mar2021. On 30Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and neck pain but she thought that was more of a vaccination saying it was working. Clinical course of the events included the following information: the patient had to stay for a while since she had allergies normally. She started getting lots of saliva and she thought that was her body saying, she did something, not a big deal. Around 15 minutes, she was at a grocery store, she started walking around, her tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, she couldn&#39;t control her breathing and heart rate, it got faster. She started getting confused, shaky, it wasn&#39;t too good. She made her way back to the place where the injections were done, they were trying to get her to use her epinephrine (EPIPEN). She took a diphenidramine (BENADRYL) while walking around looking for her husband and then took another and was wheezing. She thought BENADRYL would have helped. She should have taken her EPIPEN looking back, she thought BENADRYL would help. They heard wheezing, they contacted the other pharmacist, who contacted EMS then they came and took her to the emergency room on 29Mar2021 in the afternoon. When she was wheeled in, the doctor met her in the hall and he said they could give her a steroid shot. The patient stated she was allergic to prednisone, she got a crazy rash, itching, it&#39;s not just prednisone, it&#39;s an allergy. She got the shot at 14:15 and she was at the hospital by 15:00. The patient thought she was there for 5 hours and then she was sent home. Her blood pressure dropped. The only one she saw was 114/39 but her husband saw it went even lower than that. At the emergency room, they had the automatic thing strapped on so they watched her until it started going back up again. The vaccine shot was probably the easiest shot she had ever had. She had never had any problems. She did not research it very well in the beginning because she thought they should be good. The patient was told to not get the second vaccine. The events also required physician office visit. Allergic reaction symptoms resolved on 29Mar2021 but the swelling of her throat and heart rate lasted about four days, until 02Apr2021. Neck pain resolved on 01Apr2021. Sore arm resolved on 03Apr2021 or 04Apr2021. Blood pressure dropping resolved on an unspecified date in 2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient experienced what scared her was not feeling like she was getting enough oxygen on an unspecified date, problems breathing/her breathing still almost feels labored on 11Apr2021, arm hurt on 09Apr2021, pain in her back where her lungs are on 11Apr2021, hot and cold sweats on 10Apr2021, dizzy on 10Apr2021, shaky on 10Apr2021, nausea on 13Apr2021, body pain/flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders on 11Apr2021, out of it on 11Apr2021, weak on 10Apr2021, tired on 10Apr2021, headache on 10Apr2021, anxious on 10Apr2021, fever on 10Apr2021, itchy on 09Apr2021, feeling like maybe there is something wrong with her spleen on an unspecified date, the pain is in the left side of the back kind of by the lungs on an unspecified date, she has been sick on an unspecified date, her mental status was also affected on an unspecified date. Patient had the first dose of the Covid Vaccine on 09Apr2021 and gradually her arm hurt, she had hot sweats, she felt dizzy, was shaky, had nausea, and had body pain. The one thing she is concerned about was she had pain in her back where her lungs are and she was having problems breathing. She has a little bit of that still. She has also been out of it. Her breathing still almost feels labored, and this past weekend she thought she would go to the emergency room. Her main concern is this awful pain in her back while she was having problems breathing and getting enough oxygen. She felt weak, dizzy, and shaky. She got scared. She has been sick, she had cancer a long time ago. What scared her was not feeling like she was getting enough oxygen. The pain is in the left side of the back kind of by the lungs. It goes directly from the front to the back. On Monday it started feeling better. Today it is so much better. She will feel like she is not getting enough oxygen or giving a full breath and then this in her back. She remembers having pneumonia years ago and having pain in her lungs. That&#39;s why she knows the pain is in the back of her lungs. She has to say she is a smoker. She slowed down and couldn&#39;t smoke this week or during that. She kind of quit, that&#39;s her reality now. The pain comes and goes throughout the day but it is not as bad. She didn&#39;t have this shortness of breath and other things until a couple days after she got the vaccine. It gradually came up on her. She was not having trouble breathing, it was more slightly labored. It was not profound, just there. Sometimes when she is speaking after a while she gets tired and will have to take a moment and take a deep breath. It is so much better. She called her primary care physician and was anxious, and all he said was she would feel effects for 2 weeks. He wasn&#39;t very helpful. Her arm hurt the day that she had the shot. Even today there are little bits of pain but very light. 09Apr2021 through 11Apr2021 was when everything really hit. It was hard to lift up her arm. It was a little pain, it was no big deal. She would have the AC on and blast it when she had the hot and cold sweats. She was using napkins because she was sweating profusely. It felt like she obviously had a reaction to the vaccine. It&#39;s normal she guesses. She didn&#39;t expect it for the first dose. The 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th it was really bad. Her whole body was sweating and would get wet. She&#39;d be hot and then cold. She was anxious because she was having problems breathing. She still gets a little bit of hot and cold sweats, but nothing compared to what she went through. As the days go on she is slowly getting better. She was dizzy not just during the day, at night she couldn&#39;t sleep because of it. She has gradually gotten better. Yesterday she tried to do some gardening but felt so weak she had to come back inside. When she gets up she feels weak and a little bit of lack of air. She has labored breathing. She was real itchy. The shakiness, dizziness, and anxiety all came on and were horrible. She doesn&#39;t know if the nausea was because she couldn&#39;t eat and had to take her regular medication. It was very light nausea. She had flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders. Her headache was major too during all of this. The headache is something that comes and goes still. It is a weird kind of headache. She had a fever and got like flu all over body pain. She doesn&#39;t know how to explain how she felt out of it. She doesn&#39;t know if it was the fact she was so sick. She had a feeling of did she do that. She couldn&#39;t make decisions. She would need to take the garbage out and go back to the garbage and think what did she come here for. Her mental status was also affected. The weakness gradually got really bad, and she still hasn&#39;t recovered from it. She still feels weak and tired when trying to do things. She was tired the day after she got the vaccine. The first day she thought it was nothing and she was fine. Gradually it got real bad when she was sick. She didn&#39;t feel that flu-ish feeling but was weak and tired. She got dizzy and she had the brain fog thing. She was having really bad headaches during the same time. The weakness and tiredness go hand in hand. She takes a mineral for her thoracic spine, but she takes that more for elderly arthritis. She doesn&#39;t have any conditions that she thinks played a role. She has been feeling like maybe there is something wrong with her spleen. Took Tylenol for her fever. Mentioned fever would go away and come back. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 102, 99 and 100.1 (unit unspecified) all on unspecified dates.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever and itchy. Outcome of the event problems breathing/her breathing still almost feels labored, arm hurt, pain in her back where her lungs are, hot and cold sweats, dizzy, out of it and headache was recovering. Outcome of the event fever was recovered on 13Apr2021, itchy was recovered with sequelae on 14Apr2021, body pain/flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders was recovered on 16Apr2021, nausea was recovered on 16Apr2021, shaky was recovered on 19Apr2021. Outcome of the event weak and tired was not recovered. Outcome of all the other events was unknown.

A 62-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 28Dec2020 at 14:15 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included environmental allergies, she has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume, blood pressure (abnormal) and sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included ongoing lisinopril for blood pressure, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took novocaine but was allergic.  She got all this information when she got the vaccine on Monday at (place name) in (state name). It tells all the side effects from the first injection. She wanted to report that it is the same arm that she got the vaccine in. She has swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm.  It says you can have joint pain, but nothing about swelling. She thought she better report it. This was her first shot. She is supposed to get the second one on 18Jan2021. She wanted to make sure she can take it. She received the vaccine on 28Dec2020. She laid around that day. Today is the first day she doesn&#39;t have arm pain and swelling at the injection site.  It was the first time she has had arm pain. She has never had that with flu shot. The arm pain started within the 15 minutes she was observed. It hurt like hell until that day. She got a bruise at the injection site. It bled a little bit when she put it in. Swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm: she doesn&#39;t know if it was later that day. She can&#39;t remember. She really noticed it yesterday. She has never had joint pain or swelling. She doesn&#39;t have any problems with arthritis. Now her little finger is bigger than the rest of her fingers. It hurts because of the swelling. She doesn&#39;t want to take anything. It might be fluid. She has a high pain tolerance. She keeps bending it thinking it will get better. It isn&#39;t as bad, but its still swelled up. At first she thought it was better, but it is still pretty swollen. To her this is a reaction. She was thinking if she took paracetamol before, it wouldn&#39;t hurt as bad, but she can&#39;t remember if she took it that morning. She takes 500mg before bed for the heck of it at night. It helps her sleep better. She has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume. They think she was allergic to the preservative in the flu shot, but she has never had any trouble with the flu shot since. She has environmental allergies. They thought she was allergic to Novocaine once at the dentist office. Who knows, it only happened once. She&#39;s been to the dentist many times and who knows what they injected and why she reacted that way. She felt like she was going to pass out. They don&#39;t give it to her anymore. She doesn&#39;t know what was in it. She is worried since this vaccine is emergency authorization. She doesn&#39;t want to get the next one and have a worse reaction. She is not sure if she should be worried. The events of swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm were assessed as medically significant. Outcome of the event of &#39;swelling of fingers&#39; was not recovered, the other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event joint pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the event swelling with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1284), intramuscularly in the left arm on 29Dec2020 at 06:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), levothyroxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); both taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date.  The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) and experienced allergy from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, influenza vaccine (FLU VACCINE) for an immunization on an unspecified date (received within two weeks of vaccination).  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: muscles felt really tightened up and stiff when getting out of bed and throughout the day (worst complaint) (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight nausea/nausea (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight fatigue (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight headache (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slightly stiff neck (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, right arm pain (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, back pain (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, the muscles knot up under her rib cage/muscle tightness (non-serious) in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown.  The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020 at work, and she had been experiencing adverse events since. The worst side effect she was experiencing was muscle tightness. At the time of the report, the patient got up at 09:00, and her &#34;back was killing her.&#34; The patient was achy. The patient would tighten up really tight under both rib cages, and it made her nauseous. The patient had been taking ibuprofen (ADVIL) and ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN since she received the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine in her left arm, but her right arm hurt the next day. The next day after that (30Dec2020) she woke up and the right side of her back around the kidney area hurt. It was the right side lumbar. The next morning after that, &#34;her entire back was killing her down the middle of her spine. From her head all the way down.&#34; Since then, it came and went. The patient could not say if it was persisting, improving or worsening for any of the symptoms. &#34;It just grabs her.&#34; The day before the report, the patient thought she was doing better. The patient cleaned the house, and then sat down to eat. The past two nights, it had &#34;hit her really hard during supper time.&#34; Both of her sides of her back would tighten up; &#34;tense up like waiting for an impact before a wreck.&#34; The patient&#39;s back would seize up. The patient could not get comfortable; and would start pacing. Then, she would try to lay down. Last night, it took a half an hour to loosen back up. &#34;It knots up like crazy. It was bad enough, she thought she was going to pass out.&#34; The patient did not know if it was the combination of eating supper or what. The patient thought if she got up that maybe she would feel better. The patient started pacing around. The patient went outside because she thought maybe fresh air would help. When it would tighten up under her rib cage, it made her nauseous. The patient did not know if it was a &#34;vagus nerve thing or what.&#34; The patient was close to throwing up. The muscles knot up under her rib cage. The patient&#39;s back felt like she fell off a horse. It was weird to her that her left arm never bothered her. &#34;Nothing stays the same.&#34; Sometimes it was her entire arm or part of the arm that hurt. Like on top of her forearm. The patient thought she was doing good and then it would come back. When she moved her arm upward, she felt it. The patient said she could deal with the arm pain. It was the knotting up pains that were the worst. The patient tried calling an institute (name withheld) because it happened while eating dinner the other night. The institute (name withheld) &#34;nurse was useless.&#34; The pain was across her sacroiliac area. The patient had been &#34;living on Advil and ibuprofen for her back pain.&#34; The patient had been taking them together. The patient worked nights, and she was planning on going to work the night before the report, but she had to text her boss and tell her she could not come in. The patient was in good health; had perfect blood pressure and her sugar was normal. The patient was not diabetic. The patient&#39;s labs were always normal. The patient was really dreading that second shot. &#34;The flu shot kicked her butt for a couple of days, but this was way worse.&#34; The patient started reading up on the COVID vaccine, and it said usually younger people had severe side effects. That old people have less of a response. The patient did not know why she was experiencing such side effects. At the time of the report, it was day 7 or 8, and she was still feeling bad.  The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

At one point it seemed to settle into my hand. Knuckles swelled arthritis like. When walking up stairs I had significant muscle weakness in my legs and exertional  dyspnea.  Eyes felt &#34;feverish&#34; but had no fever. The next morning while trying to do a routine workout the same thing happened. It was a significant change to my normal condition. The dyspnea was the most concerning. The body aches settled into my lower back. Fatigue was moderate-moderately severe.  As the day went on things waxed and waned.  By the end of 72 hrs. most symptoms subsided. Friday 01/08/2021 I had a completely normal workout, no exertional  dyspnea, fatigue subsided, no body aches. Back to normal. I would consider the symptoms to have been  Moderate&#43;.

                                                Almost immediately after the injection, I noticed a metallic taste. It was mild enough that it did not interfere with the taste of foods or drinks. It was noticeable whenever I had not had anything by mouth for a while. This lasted for 2 to 3, maybe 4, days.  Soreness at the injection site, and stiffness of the arm, began the evening after the injection.  Warming applications and moving the arm relieved these symptoms.  They were gone the next day.

                                                I had my first vaccination on 1/11/21 at HD. The reaction was typical- significantly sore red inflammed arm over deltoid muscle that resolved after 3 days. Second dose given 21 days later- some swelling and soreness, low grade fever. Then 3 days later, I awoke, turned in bed and experienced an intense shearing pain in my neck and arm. The pain was the worst ever felt, and was not improved with NSAIDS, Acetaminophen, Hydrocodone, or Tramadol. I went to an urgent care center on 1/16 where a tentative diagnosis of sprained neck was made. The sypmptoms continue with slight improvement with steroids, and a muscle relaxant. I am concerned because I understand that covid itself can impact the nervous system considerably.  I am awaiting improvement in symptoms and if none seen then I will see my primary care MD

A 62-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT#: GL3248 (Caller said that the G may be an E.)), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at second single dose for working with cancer patients. Medical history included ongoing diabetic and ongoing hyperthyroidism, both diagnosed about 6 years ago and were under control. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 for working with cancer patients (First dose, lot number: EJ1685, injection in the left arm). On 11Jan2021 the patient had chills, joint pain, and lower GI symptoms. Her lower GI symptoms included diarrhea. Then caller clarified that it was not diarrhea but the urge to go. The stools were solid. She also had lots of flatulence. She was also wiped out of energy, around like 2 PM on 11Jan2021 she went up a flight of stairs and was so exhausted. The patient is a nurse. She was in her office that day and had to literally lay on the floor because she was so wiped out of energy. She left work early and went to bed. Then the next day 12Jan2021, she was unable to get out of bed the whole day. She is so sleepy and has no energy. She went to bed last night at 08:30, but is still so sleepy. Today she is feeling better, but still had lower GI symptoms. She was also feeling cold, which she normally is always hot. She was having to put 5 blankets on her. Outcome of the event chills was recovered on 12Jan2021, of events joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed was recovering, of events flatulence and feeling cold was unknown. The reporter considered the event chills, joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed as serious (disability) and related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported chills, joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, given the plausible temporal association.

EMTs were called but I didn&#39;t go to the hospital.  My son picked me up and took me home because I was unable to drive.  On the way I experienced loss of vision and speech for about 5 minutes.  When I got home, my legs were so shaky that I had to have help walking.  I started getting severe chills that took 3 hours to get warm (2 heavy blankets, space heater, and heating pad).  I was very fatigued and felt bad the rest of the day.  (Saturday)The next day I had flu-like symptoms; headache, joint aches, chills, nausea, extreme fatigue.  Sunday was better but still had to rest most of the day because when I would stay up for over 30 minutes, the symptoms would return.  Monday-  stomach cramps, headache, fatigue  but went to work (30 minutes late due to stomach) and left 30 minutes early.

All of these predate treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine and Lipitor. She got to where she couldn&#39;t stand up straight, but she went to physical therapy. She had surgery in 2015. She had a problem in 2018 and they gave her shots and that helped. Family history was none. Concomitant medications included estradiol (ESTRING) (for three years) for vaginal dryness, fish oil (taking for three to four years) for high cholesterol, paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL) (taking for 20 years) for depression, cyamopsis tetragonoloba gum (BENEFIBER FIBER SUPPLEMENT) (using for a year), vitamin d3 (VITAMIN D3) (using for five years; she used to be on calcium but it can cause heart problems so her doctor told to take Vitamin D), dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) (taking for five years) for acid reflux, (ALLEGRA) (taking for 5 years ) for allergy, (QNASL) (using for 3 years), allergy shots (used forever) for allergy and stool softener (taking for 5 years) to &#34;keep things moving&#34;; all were from unspecified dates and ongoing.

The patient called to report a problem with her lower back after receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine. &#34;I&#39;ve had surgery and a couple of shots, the CAT scan kind. I have been fine for a while, just had a sore arm and yesterday I noticed a problem with my lower back and thought it may have been because I painted, but it is still bothering me. I remembered when I went on Lipitor I started having problems with my back about 3 weeks in, same deal. The doctor took me off and I went back on a month later and I started having problems again. Because I don&#39;t know if it was the vaccine, I am wondering if I should get the second dose.&#34; She clarified she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 15Jan2021 at 12:53PM in the left arm. She noticed a sore arm right afterward which lasted at least 48 hours. Then on 20Jan2021, she noticed lower left side back pain. Mentions she thinks it is at the L4 or L5 and this is the same place she had a shot there in 2018 for back pain and previously had surgery on that location in 2015. With regard to Lipitor, she is unsure of the exact year, but states it was probably back in 2017. After taking Lipitor she noticed her back pain coming back. Her doctor took her off of Lipitor for a month and it got better. Then he put her back on Lipitor and she had the same back pain problem. She stated that she is unsure if she will take the second dose and asked with regard to her back pain should she take the second dose. Outcome of  &#34;received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 15Jan2021 at 12:53PM in the left arm/ she noticed a sore arm right afterward&#34; was recovered on 18Jan2021, outcome of lower left side back pain was not recovered, while outcome of rash was unknown.

                                                heart rate of 160; severe nausea; arm soreness; muscle soreness in left arm; general fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 62-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 62 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EK5730) administered on 30Dec2020 at 01:00PM and the patient said she did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. The patient received no concomitant medications. She stated that she had no other recent vaccinations or new medications. One thing that may be important is that she did do a 7 day detox that ended the Sunday before her second vaccine dose, so her body was pretty much having no impurities in it, and she has been eating clean since then, maybe having something foreign put into her body set it off after detox. The patient experienced arm soreness and general fatigue on 21Jan2021, and on 22Jan2021 at 01:00 she experienced severe nausea and heart rate of 160 (which was reported serious as medically significant). Patient reported that after her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine she had a significant side effect that didn&#39;t happen until 10-12 hours after getting the vaccine. She did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. After the second injection her arm was sore, and she had general fatigue. She had the second dose injected Thursday at around 01:00PM, then at one in the morning her heart rate was 160, and she had severe nausea. She was that way until 08:00AM. Her heart rate was 120 probably by 09:00AM, then came down to 100, she has never had anything like that before. Her arm soreness was a deep muscle soreness to her left arm. The fatigue was a couple hours later after she got the second dose of the vaccine. The nausea started at 01:00AM, and lasted until six to eight, she did no treatment, and it improved and is still gone now. For her heart rate of 160, she had no treatment, though she probably should have gone to the hospital, but it came down. She usually runs a heart rate of 60-70, it went back to normal Friday, probably in the afternoon on the 22nd, about 12 hours after that started. The patient stated that she feels this is medically significant for her heart rate to be that high. She had contacted her primary care physician (PCP), but they didn&#39;t call her back for 4-5 hours, by then she was fine. She doesn&#39;t think that this was treated well by her PCP, and that they should have done an electrocardiogram (EKG) and follow up labs, she is changing her PCP as a result of this. She is concerned about the people who will be getting their second dose, she has been helping with these, they have patients that are over 100, they wouldn&#39;t survive that rapid heartbeat. The outcome of arm soreness/muscle soreness and fatigue was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event of heart rate increased was likely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I am submitting this as a supplementary report to the report assigned on March 1, 2021.  This is day 10 after the vaccine and my mast cell reactivity symptoms have increased by the day--internal and external swelling, flushing, pruritis, wheezing, tightness in chest, as well as pain and pressure in arm pits, groin, and ears.  By late afternoon I am severely fatigued, weak, and foggy-headed.  These symptoms are consistent with those I experienced during the twenty years when my mast cell disease was unstable.  Through identification of my triggers and avoidance of the same, I have been symptom and medication free for the past three years--until taking the Covid-19 vaccine.  It appears that the vaccine has reactivated an excessive degranulation response in my mast cells and that response is getting worse as my body responds to the vaccine.  I realize that the percentage of persons who suffer from a condition like mine is small, but I would have appreciated having the information that I am submitting to you when I was weighing the pros and cons of vaccination.  I know from the twenty years of navigating this disease that there is nothing that can be done at this point other than taking various H1 and H2 blockers.  This vaccine appears to be undoing the hard-won level of stability achieved through years of careful lifestyle management.

A 62-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982, expiration date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shingles which she contracted in 2019, about one and a half years ago, it was a shingles on her back and lower back which she stated were the worst place for shingles has attacked, it left her with severe pain in both legs; diabetes; and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included losartan, atenolol (a beta-blocker), and metformin for diabetes. The patient took the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and after about 2-4 days (Jan2021), she had a little chill and got very tired. She had to take care of herself. She was very tired not realizing it was the shot she took. She also felt like she has no energy. The patient was working from home but a lot of times, she was lying on the couch. Over the weekend (Jan2021), she had a slight pain on left arm. About a week or 8-10 days later (2021), she got very tired and couldn&#39;t even sit up. Her body was not itself. She started to feel like a bus rolling over her, like somebody took a baseball bat and beat her really bad. The patient uses her arm a lot and her hand started to feel a lot of pain. She couldn&#39;t even touch herself; it was so sensitive. She took paracetamol (TYLENOL) but it didn&#39;t work. She had celecoxib (CELEBREX) an anti-inflammatory, she thought she was maybe inflamed, but it didn&#39;t work. She had some diclofenac cream, she rubbed it, but it didn&#39;t work. The patient had shingles about a year and a half ago which was very bad. She just felt weak and didn&#39;t feel like herself anymore. She had a little bit of nausea and her whole body was really terrible. When she had the shingles, it left her with severe pain in both legs. She saw a neurologist and told her that she would have to take pregabalin (LYRICA) and it would go away. So, when she had severe pain last week, she took pregabalin but it didn&#39;t help. The patient took half of acetaminophen, oxycodone (PERCOCET) as she was not the person who takes pills, but it didn&#39;t work. Her body was so severe on Friday, it was not going away, the pain was there 24 hours. The patient has been experiencing this for 8-10 days now. She took one PERCOCET on Friday and had a slight relief and didn&#39;t took anything again. She kept rubbing the diclofenac cream, but it was not much of a relief. This morning, she has to work, she was sitting so she took PERCOCET. She is getting her second shot on Friday, 12Feb2021. She asked how she will feel after the second dose if she felt that way after the first dose, if the first shot was adequate, and if she should take the second dose. She stated that she didn&#39;t want to take the second dose. Her body felt so weak including her fingers and hand. It triggered the shingles pain in her back and felt like she was beaten up by someone. She has to lie down for the pain in her back. She also mentioned that she couldn&#39;t sit for so long as her waist and back were so painful. She was lying on a heating pad and ice and nothing was working. She even has a hard time getting up. She thought what happened was it triggered the shingles pain in her back and also left her with a problem under her feet. The shingles left her with some kind of damage when she took the shot. It was really bad. Her son was a physician and was concerned because last week, it got so bad, she didn&#39;t come out, she was in bed and bedridden from Friday to Sunday. She had no appetite, she didn&#39;t eat. The only thing that the patient had was diabetes and high blood pressure, but it was under control. She just checked her pressure and its was 130/80, and now, because of the pain, it went up a little bit, but before my pressure was like 120 something, over 68 or 72 it was always around the 60s and 70s. Since she was having this, it was a little high. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                The first reaction - 15 minutes after the vaccine - I felt really dizzy and loopy. She told me, I think you better sit back down. I felt better after sitting there for 30 minutes after. I didn&#39;t get dizzy again. I finished my workday. Next morning, I woke up with a fever 100.8 (about). I woke up with sore muscles - I tend to get sore muscles easily but I felt more sore than normal and I had a headache. Fever stopped after 24 hours. Note: I also get dizzy really easily - and so it isn&#39;t difficult for something to make me dizzy.  I also felt really tired. And over the weekend, I felt nauseated (not initially but over the weekend.) And that lasted until about midday Monday (over the weekend) to be getting better . I took Tylenol and I rested. That helped with the symptoms.

This case was also received from Pfizer sponsored program.  A 62-year-old female patient received the 2nd dose (at the age of 62-years-old) of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot# not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in Feb2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung and back problems (back pain). It was reported that the patient normally took an inhaler (not steroid inhaler because she didn&#39;t want to interfere with immune response), and other things. The patient previously took prednisone which started at 40mg for 2 days, 30 for 2 days, 20 for 2 days then goes down to zero for back pain (stopped taking 4 days before the second dose of the vaccine). The patient received the first dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE (Lot# not provided) on 29Jan2021 (at the age of 62-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s 2nd dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE was administered a week ago (Feb2021) Friday. It was reported that she got very ill initially which she said joint pain in hands and headache noted in Feb2021 (Saturday) which wasn&#39;t so bad. On Saturday afternoon, she reported shortness of breath, coughing with extreme pain (painful cough) and described a feeling of bugs crawling in her lungs, bugs front and back, and itching, and no one else reported it. The patient kept sleeping and waking up, thinking she was alright, but the coughing and lasted until Sunday evening, it was a very painful cough, and a creeping sensation in lungs front and back. She missed work on Monday. The events (joint pain in hands, headache, shortness of breath, coughing with extreme pain (painful cough) and itching) were medically significant as she was unable to go to work. It was also mentioned that since the patient stopped taking the Prednisone 4 days before the second dose of the vaccine. The patient had an exacerbation of pain (it came back). The patient was also wondering when can she start the inhaler and steroid for the back as she has lung and back problems. Outcome of the events were unknown.   Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on data provided, the reported events are assessed as possibly related to BNT162B2.

Very tired . Tired enough that I accidentally  left the house for a job interview wearing one white sock and one black sock. Which isn&#39;t normal for me. 3rd day: muscle aches. 4th days feels like a really mild virus.   This is not me but another person from  my former job said she had spontaneous canker sores from the Pfizer shot.

On 2/8, I had a tele visit with my doctor. I took Tylenol as instructed to make sure that I didn&#39;t develop a fever. My doctor said that it could be from the vaccine. My left leg and foot were swollen on 2/13, so I called my doctor again and he sent me for a Doppler to check for a blood clot. I saw him on 2/15 in person. I have lower back pain and weakness in my legs at times, but it doesn&#39;t prevent me from doing anything. They feel heavy, especially if I walk for an extended period of time.

My armpit is swollen and painful.  The pain goes thru my underarm down to my hand. The pain makes it difficult to sleep. Tylenol doesn&#39;t take the pain away.  At first I thought the pain was a side effect to  the initial vaccine, but it got worse as time went on.  Finally I researched it on line and saw that lymph nodes have been reported as swelling due to the vaccine.

She stated that she was wondering what if it was with the vaccine that is reacting to what it thinks is Covid, or is it the body&#39;s response. She was wondering if Pfizer comes out with a booster with the variant, should she not take the booster. She stated that it could have killed her if they had not caught the blood clot in her brain and had she not gone to the ER it could have killed her and she was concerned about taking a booster.

                                                As I was sitting at my computer and suddenly I could barely keep my eyes open, I was so tired I couldn&#39;t lift my arms and once I closed my eyes, I could not muster the strength to open them.  I felt like I was going to faint and then I got nauseated and I knew I was going to throw up. With my husband&#39;s help, I did manage to get to the bathroom (about 6 steps away).  I threw up and immediately sat down in the nearest chair.  I threw up a second time into a vessel after that.  I then got a massive headache and chills.  I could barely walk with assistance up the stairs to go to bed.  I have never been more fatigued.  After going to bed, I slept all night and woke the next day still fatigued, but nothing like the night before.  I was able to work, even though I felt really tired.  I did not have much of an appetite all day and two days later, I still feel fatigued.

A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 24Dec2020 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, ongoing allergies. She was asthmatic and believed that the virus would have affected her differently if she didn&#39;t get the vaccine. If she was to catch the virus and didn&#39;t have the vaccine she may not have come out of it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient denied getting any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. Received the COVID vaccine at her workplace. The patient got COVID virus on 07Jan2021. It was also reported that the patient lost a lot of weight, but still plump, coughing, tightness in chest, upper chest tightness with post nasal drip, like the flu, body aches, all on an unspecified date. Emergency room visit needed for the events (body aches, runny nose). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Covid PCR testing: negative on 04Jan2021, positive on 07Jan2021, rapid COVID testing: negative on 01Jan2021. The outcome of the event (got COVID virus) was not recovered, of other remain events was unknown.  Clinical course: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Dec2020, and a couple weeks later she got the COVID virus (07Jan2021). Mentioned she lost a lot of weight, but still plump. Probably be in the hospital now. Still had some coughing, tightness in chest, but it&#39;s not as bad. Upper chest tightness with post nasal drip, like the flu, runny nose in throat that goes down into the lungs and when it goes down she coughs and hacks to get rid of it. Went to the doctor office on the 01Jan2021 and did a rapid test and it was negative. Then on 04Jan2021 she did another PCR Covid test and it was negative. On 07Jan2021 she had symptoms and was insistent on getting another test since having body aches, runny nose. Got the re-test and it came back positive when she went to the emergency room. Got the PCR test. The patient thought that the way they were testing is how it&#39;s spreading. Did the testing on the 04Jan2021 and they used a swab bigger than a cue tip, it was huge and couldn&#39;t get far up enough instead of the tiny ones. On the 07Jan2021 at her job, emergency room, they had the tiny ones and was able to go further up and that&#39;s when she tested positive. Mentioned using salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) nebulizer, over the counter cough syrup, prescription azelastine hydrochloride;fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) nasal spray, and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED). When has the dry cough she uses the ALBUTEROL nebulizer with the machine and vials at home and that slows down the coughing a lot and the other stuff with the lungs. Not taking any steroids. Using SUDAFED to stop the runny nose from post nasal drip from going into lungs.

(Patient stated shortness of breath was another symptom that she had from COVID and is continuing somewhat especially when I was a mask for work -  but had not put it in the first report). Chills on Friday morning in the middle of night; woke up and my temp was 101.3 and I was feeling bad all day; had headache and went back to bed. Still have pain in hip/knee and joints and those pains got really bad after the vaccine - increased. Doctor  vist told me to use Ibuprofen to 3 times a day for that pain.  Shortness of breath continues from Covid symptoms and so does the hip/joint pain - it has decreased.

                                                About 5:30 or so and I was going to go to lunch at work - I felt like a heartburn and I was looking for a tums. I didn&#39;t have any. I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

Concomitant medications included buspirone hydrochloride (BUSPAR) and other medications that she just take a half every other day, it is a small amount. She take 5 mg every other day. She was really taking much. The consumer had lab work, may be not sure 2 to 3 weeks, she has been feeling lot of fatigue. Actually, she did do lab work, it was just like lot of blood work. The consumer stated, &#34;I am having some loss of taste and tightening in the jaw and that was immediately. Tightening is still there and the taste loss seems to happen like a day later. Tightening is on the side where the forehead is and the front like on the two sides is the pressure on the side of the head. I guess, just thinking of a headache.

The muscle pain has de erased, but the injection site is very tender and the rash has spread down my arm about 2-3 inches.  Today, day 5, the rash is slightly itchy.   On day 2, I had chills, body aches, joint pain and a headache.  All symptoms were gone within 48 hours with the exception of the headache.  The headache lasted until day 5.

Then my lower lip began to swell.  I would consider these symptoms somewhere between mild to moderate.  The symptoms began around 4:30 in the afternoon and subsided as the evening progressed.  The next morning (today), my face feels basically normal again.  My only symptoms now are a sore arm and a slight headache.  I have experienced allergic reactions before but never from a vaccine.

Also, around 12 hours after shot I had four hours of extreme muscle pain and shivering.  This was on my first dose.  I know it&#39;s prevalent on the 2nd dose.  I&#39;m not worried about that but am concerned with my hearing.

                                                10 hours after first dose of Pfizer Vaccination, I developed an itchy, raised bump that looked like a mosquito bite on the inside of my left elbow (same arm as vaccination). It resolved over the following couple of hours. 24 hours after vaccination (14 hours after the original presentation of the itchy bump on my elbow), I developed a couple of itchy bumps on my leg and trunk. Over the following 16 hours (24-40 hours after vaccination) I had what was diagnosed by health care professionals as an outbreak of hives affecting both forearms, both ankles, left knee and trunk. This episode resolved about 40 hours after vaccination. One week later, I have had mild, generalized, off and on itching and prickly skin sensation but no obvious outward signs of bumps or rash. I am seeking advice from an allergist on whether to proceed with second vaccination. Will be tested for PEG reaction before then.  This is my second report. I requested a key to update my initial report (VAERS E-Report) but never received one.

                                                Within an hour after receiving the vaccine which stung going in, I started to experience severe and debilitating pain in my neck.  It starts at the base of my skull and ends at the top of my back.   This pain is incredibly severe and is not resolved with anything.  I tried Tylenol, Advil, Aleve, CBD oil, meditation, hot shower, whiskey, heat, and ice.  NOTHING works. It is now Sunday and the symptoms are still present.  They are not as often, but still as severe when they occur.  I am very hesitant to get the 2nd shot now because of this reaction.  I typically have a high tolerance for pain, but if this was constant I would not be able to live with it.  Talking and breathing were unbearable!

Increased ear ringing.  Sinus and head pressure.  Slight queasiness.  When the shot was first given, I had immediate pain at the injection site and up my neck.  As the day progressed I felt tired, achy all over.  The burning, stinging pain increased, in both arms and upper back.  It seems worse at night and wakes me up.  It is severe enough that it makes me cry.  I have used regular strength Tylenol, Regular strength Advil and Allegra, as treatment.  The burning pain continues.  So does the muscle aching and fatigue.

The next day, I became very ill around 1pm with incontrollable chills, severe spinal pain from Cervical to sacrum, and severe radiating pain on both sides of my back. Pain ranked as a 7-8/10. Took 800 mg of Advil and then took Tylenol 3 hours later and no change. Thought about going to ER but did not go. The next day pain was reduced to a 3/10 and was extremely tired and no energy and was lying down most of the day with extremely fatigue. Gradually better the next two days for full recovery.

After 2 weeks most of the swelling is gone just a slight bit. Headaches have been every day until yesterday.  Went to dr the following Monday after the vaccine as was give some anti inflammatory shots in my neck as not allowed anything ( cortisone) due to vaccine. Taking Tylenol and Advil and using Valteran.  Dr was not sure if from exercise or the vaccine but have been exercising throughout the pandemic. Never had headaches when my neck would bother me only hand tingling and that was not this time.  The acupuncturist today said still a bit swollen and tender and feels that it is a combination of the neck and the vaccine as the vaccine attacked my most vulnerable spot.  I had a massage today to to try to stretch my neck.  Headache is doing better today and I can move my neck more.

I took steroids that night but I couldn&#39;t hardly slee because of the pain. I had to call out because I could hardly walk. Steroid dose was for 9 days and after wards it resolved.

I took 120 mg  Allegra. I started to feel relief after about 10 minutes.  I had to relieve my throat of mucus this morning.  Other than muscular aches, especially at the site of the vaccine and behind my shoulder, I am ok. About 10 - 11 hours after my first vaccine on 2/26/2021, I developed a similar reaction, however much milder, and took Allegra, which relieved the symptoms.

                                                Started with a bad headache and very sore arm the first night. The morning of the day after I was vaccinated, I took my temperature and it was up to 101, which is high for me. I ached everywhere and my neck was so stiff, I could hardly stand to turn my head. My left arm, where I was vaccinated felt sore and tight in my shirt, but I couldn?t turn my head far enough to look at it to see if it was red or not. My temp went up to 102, the highest it?s been since I had osteomyelitis after my accident- no kidding! I slept most of the day both Thursday and Friday.  I woke up Saturday at 2 pm and felt fine again- like nothing happened. But, I thought it was Friday. I was sick enough &amp; sleeping enough that I acted lost a day completely! I never got nauseous- just terrible headache, stiff neck, joint &amp; muscle pain , fatigue and 102 fever.  There is a question of whether I have had Covid. I was very sick for 4 weeks- the whole month of February, 2020. My daughter had been in (Country) on business and met with collegues from all over the (Country), including (Country), in January, 2020. My brother died unexpectedly while she was gone. She flew back to (State) on a Thursday night and then got right back on a flight to (city) to stay with me for a week. She missed the wake, but was a comfort to me. I get very sick about a week after she left.

                                                After the 1st shot, I was ill for about a day: extreme fatigue, every joint in body ached, sore throat. After 2nd shot, not symptoms until Saturday. I noticed a swelling between my left breast and my armpit. It developed into a very pronounced lump at my armpit and toward left breast. There was tenderness when I used the arm.  As of today, the swelling is down- not quite normal yet- but no tenderness.

That was followed by bilateral eye pain so that the only comfortable thing to do was to put on eye shades. I was exhausted by the afternoon. I had absolutely zero energy to do anything but lie down. By Sunday morning every inch of my skin was sensitive, every joint was sore  and every muscle group in my body was painful. The symptoms from the previous day remained; head and eye pain. I used both tylenol and advil a few times but without relief.  Monday my body/joints were still achy and I was super tired but not like the previous 2 days. I became very depressed and fearful that it would not let up. Today is Wednesday and its the first day I feel like myself again although I did have to take a nap 3 hours after I woke up today. Body still aches but nothing like it was

                                                Extreme thirst, chills, full body muscle aches, dizziness, extreme fatigue (so much so I could barely keep my eyes open when driving after 8 hours of sleep the night before), nausea, stomach upset.  Note:  I have not had a flu shot for 25 years, nor have I ever had the flu during that time, but the symptoms do seem flu like.  It is now end of day 2 following the 2nd dose of vaccine and I still feel incredibly icky.

The patient received 1st shot 0220 pm yesterday (08Mar2021), she came home and she was fine, she worked around the house, she took a shower and above her left knee cap it looks like there was another knee cap and it looks like in the shape of a mushroom it was hard in the middle, water around it. On her right leg there was a big red welt that was the size of her cap, she had canker under her tongue. She went to the hospital and the hospital gave her an Epipen.

A 63-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Mar2021 11:00 AM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history predating treatment with the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine included fracture on that left foot where the toenail came off and she had a wound that wouldn&#39;t heal. She was fully recovered from the foot injury in Dec2020. Then she came down with a positive COVID 19 test on 11Dec2020. Symptoms started on 07Dec2021 with a fever and everything and she ended up in the ER with bilateral pneumonia and they sent her home on 17Dec2020. Then later, she was admitted to the hospital on 25Dec2020 with excruciating pain in her chest, lungs and legs; and she was having shortness of breath. She was found to have a  DVT, PE and bilateral pneumonia. She was discharged 30Dec2020. She thinks she has the long time syndrome after COVID. She was still having shortness of breath, itchiness, and extreme fatigue from the COVID 19 infection but her HCP advised her to get the COVID 19 vaccine anyway. She thinks the chest congestion and cough were cleared up now, but she has noticed hair loss. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient stated that her husband, son and herself received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 02Mar2021. They all waited the 15 minute waiting period after receiving the vaccine for a reaction and was fine. Her husband and son went ahead to the car and she went to use the restroom. 20 minutes later, while in the restroom, she got a random ting outside her left foot like an electrical type very painful pain that came up the outside left ankle, leg, and calf. She had an excruciatingly painful electrical feeling like a zing that shot from her left foot and ankle to her calf/ zinging sensation left ankle on 02Mar2021. The pain was from the same foot that she had broken before. It happened once and she was like what was that and then it stopped. Maybe 5 seconds went by then it happened again this random zap of electrical feeling that she cant really explain but it gave her whole body goosebumps. It did it 5 times in a row with pauses in between in the same exact place left lower leg. After it stopped and as she was washing her hands she had a really sharp pain in her breast on 02Mar2021 and then that was it. She walked out to the car and she didn&#39;t say anything to her husband or son because she didn&#39;t really understand what was happening and she felt fine other than the crazy pain and once it ended it ended. When she got home and in the afternoon because she was home working remotely it happened again the same exact spot left lower leg and the pain was excruciating when it was happening. This time she thinks it was four times in a row with pauses in between same exact spot just in her left lower leg. This time she told her husband &#34;I didn&#39;t say anything before but its happening again and its weird.&#34; She never had this feeling before. Adds it was so excruciating. She was just holding her breath counting how many times it will occur. It happened again that night and then she almost afraid to go to sleep because the pain would wake her up but nothing happened as she slept. She woke up the next morning and had to go to an ophthalmologist appointment and happened again while she was sitting in the chair. She had another episode of the painful zing in her foot. That was the last time it did and it might have happened again but altogether she had 4-5 episodes in a 24 hour period after receiving the vaccine. Each time she would have several painful zings. She also noticed a tingling on her lip on 03Mar2021; a painful zinging sensation on her right breast; and a tingling sensation on one finger of her hand that happened one time on 03Mar2021. That day, she had a tingling in one finger and a zap or electrical like feeling in her upper lip and that was it those didn&#39;t really bother her they were more tingling and electrical feeling. She called her primary doctor and he hadn&#39;t heard of anything like it before but he cant rule it out. He said the only way you would know is if you got the shot again but she states she is a little scared. She would like to know if this side effect has been reported before and if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. She was scheduled to receive the next dose on next Tuesday, 23Mar2021. She mentioned she had blood work this week but she has no results at this time. The outcome of sharp pain in her breast/ painful zinging sensation on her right breast was recovered on 02Mar2021, of excruciatingly painful electrical feeling like a zing that shot from her left foot and ankle to her calf was recovered on 03Mar2021, of pain that came up the outside left ankle/ zinging sensation left ankle was recovered on 04Mar2021, of tingling on her lip/ zap or electrical like feeling in her upper lip was recovered on 03Mar2021, and of tingle on the right hand finger/ electrical feeling was  recovered on 03Mar2021.

She was holding ice on it now, trying to sooth it. She was wondering where she would go for reaction, she knew she had reaction like this before so she had a side effect from it, and her arm was kind of still stiff and sore.

She also stated that she did not take Tylenol today. She did not know what she wanted to get through to somebody and she needed to speak to somebody on what she needed to do.

Control No.: 21K-163-3848385-00). A 63-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6207) intramuscular in the right arm on 18Mar2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; adalimumab (HUMIRA) solution for injection, subcutaneously, from an unspecified date at an unspecified dose and frequency for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Medical history included polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), RA, hypothyroidism, anemia. The patient had no known allergies. It was unknown if the patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications included prednisone, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), folic acid, calcium carbonate (CAL). The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of BNT162B2. On 18Mar2021 (within 4 hours of the vaccination), the patient experienced a rheumatoid arthritis flare up. The clinical course was as follows: on 18Mar2021 at 15:00, the patient experienced pain in elbow and finger pain (like trigger finger of both hands). On Mar2021 (within 24 hours), all fingers were involved, the patient&#39;s grip strength was decreased (she could not make a fist or grasp or grip/ inability to grip or grasp with her hands) and experienced left wrist pain. On Mar2021 (within 48 hours), the patient experienced finger edema, was still unable to make fist or grasp, experienced painful shooting pains up inner arms, right ear &amp; head pains. The patient increased the prednisone dose to 4 mg daily as treatment for the events. On 21Mar2021 at 11:00 (72 hours after vaccination), the patient continued to experience bilateral arm pains, slight hand grips but could not lift, new right knee and right outer foot pains. On 21Mar2021 (94 hours after vaccination), there was less arm pain and finger edema, continued right ear/head pains. The patient saw the primary physician, there was no ear infection and the physician agreed with the prednisone increase. The physician felt the patient should not take the second vaccine dose and alerted the rheumatologist. On 22Mar2021 (116 hours after vaccination), the patient was able to lift and grasp with both hands, had less ear and arm pain. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19. The action taken with adalimumab in response to the events was unknown. The reporter&#39;s causality for the events trigger finger, inability to grip or grasp with her hands, severe flare of RA symptoms 4 hours post vaccine, pain in arms and elbows, pain in ears was not provided. The clinical outcome of rheumatoid arthritis flare up, trigger finger, &#34;grip strength decreased/could not make fist or grasp or grip/ inability to grip or grasp with her hands&#34;, pain in arm, right ear &amp; head pains was resolving; while of pain in elbow was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject vaccine contributed to the RA flare and other events.  The reported events may likely represent intercurrent medical conditions.   There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

She wondered if it is okay to take second dose and what the right medication is to take to help with the pain. Patient did not visit emergency room. The patient assessed the report as serious. Outcome of muscle pain in legs was not recovered, outcome of other events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 63-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8729), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Apr2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as many medical conditions, names unknown, just a combination of medical problems. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications, some of which were taken in the morning. The patient had the vaccine on 02Apr2021 (reported as &#34;Friday or Saturday&#34;) in the afternoon and had a bad adverse reaction to it. The patient had swelling in the face, hives on her back, itching that was in her back, and, allergic reactions on 02Apr2021. Due to these, since she was just in a medical facility, doctor and nurses over there were able to inject her with Benadryl that was a strong dose, in a long needle given into the muscle and stuff. It was good enough that she got up and was sent home. She then seemed to be fine but on Monday, 05Apr2021, she couldn&#39;t get out of the bed as the pain all the way down to her back was killing her, like it was paralyzing her. She could not even get out of the bed for like hours. The neck and back pain on Apr2021 were pretty intense, and she does not know where and how it came so she was trying to figure that out and realized she just recently had the vaccine injection. She knew that there could be some kind of reaction, but she was not sure if it were from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure she did not get something serious because she already has rare conditions. She added she did not have any prior treatment for these because she did not even think like this was even a side effect of the Pfizer vaccine but now she was wondering if it was because she had not taken anything prior. She does not know if it was related or not and she was concerned about it. She wanted to know what she could do if these were side effects because she knew there were some people that have something to do with the spinal cord and she was not sure if their symptoms were like hers or not. She wanted to know if she would need treatment for it and if it was an adverse reaction. She added that the swelling in her face and, itching that was in her back went away the same day when she was given the vaccine. The outcome of the events swelling in the face and itching that was in her back was recovered on 02Apr2021. The outcome of the other remaining events was unknown.

She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4; was not able to walk at first; her arm was cold; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 63-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 08:00 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included high blood pressure that was diagnosed 2-3 years ago, diabetes; she was prediabetic, heart;cholesterol has been high for about 30 years; since she was in her 30s; all from an unknown date and ongoing. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 63-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no prior vaccination in four weeks. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin taken for blood cholesterol and takes 20mg once a day prior to stroke and in the hospital they increased it to 40mg once a day and ongoing; ramipril taken for blood pressure and she was prescribed with this medication for a while prior to her stroke. It was discontinued in the hospital. Stated that she did not take it everyday because she was allergic to it; and sitagliptin (JANUVIA [SITAGLIPTIN]) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing and stated that she has been taking for quite a while. On 24Feb2021 she had her second shot. She said that everything was fine that morning; that afternoon her arm was sore. Stated she thought nothing of it. That evening she entertained guest. They were saying she sounded different; they said her speech sounded slurred. She had gotten her vaccine at around 08:00. Again, she didn&#39;t think anything about her speech. On 25Feb2021, she got up and did some laundry going up and down the steps. Stated that it was difficult because her arm was still sore. She cleaned the house. At around 15:30 she was doing bills and noticed that her writing looked like a baby&#39;s scribble. On 26Feb2021, she noticed that her left arm was weak and was told by her doctor to go to the Emergency Room where they told her she had a stroke. She added that it seemed like her arm was cold for a number of weeks. Stated she was the type to wear t-shirts in the winter because she was always hot. During those weeks she was wearing heavy clothes and was under blankets. She was just now starting to feel more like herself and not so cold all the time. The patient was unable to recall time frame when this symptom began. The events did require a visit to emergency room and physician office. The patient was hospitalized for 4 days due to the events from 26Feb2021 to 01Mar2021. During hospitalization, the patient saw a cardiologist, neurologist, her primary care provider, and the hospitalists who all said it was very suspicious that her stroke happened right after her vaccine. Before she got her second vaccine, she was doing embroidery and everything she normally does; nothing was wrong. They did a CAT Scan that showed nothing. Then the MRI of the brain showed a Pontine Stroke on 26Feb2021. Cardiologist put a heart monitor on her and could not find anything. They were looking for A-Fib or something like that when she was on the heart monitor in the hospital; but it never showed anything irregular. She had a loop recorder implanted to monitor her heart and they haven&#39;t found anything wrong on it. She had heart tests, carotid artery tests, ultrasound of her heart and nothing was found on those tests. They pretty much told her in the hospital that they couldn&#39;t find a reason for her stroke. She kept asking about the vaccine. They did not rule it out as a cause, but they also did not say it was the cause. All the doctors said they could not pin her stroke on the vaccine. They stated it was suspicious and that they had seen 2-3 other patients with a similar situation. One of the doctor&#39;s told her he would not rule it out. They did an ultrasound of her carotids and heart and did not find anything on those tests that would have caused her stroke. She was having lasting effects related to her stroke. Her arm was still sore at times, stated it was a different kind of sore and could be related to all the therapy she does now. The lingering effects after stroke was reported as she was not able to walk at first. She&#39;s been doing therapy focused on her left side. Stated that her left side was the dominant side and she cannot write or type. She couldn&#39;t do the report online due to the difficulty with typing. She wanted to make sure this was reported. The patient has been doing therapy for 7 weeks, twice a day; and stated she likely still has months more of therapy to try and get her left side back to normal. She said that simple daily duties are difficult. The patient also stated that she was prediabetic before her hospitalization with her number (A1c) usually being 6.5-6.8. She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4. She doesn&#39;t know what made it go up. Then states she doesn&#39;t know if the vaccine made it go up or not. She has a follow up with the neurologist soon. The patient also reported medications she has been taking since her stroke and hospitalization; but not prior to her vaccine which included Amlodipine-Benazepril:  5-20mg once a day and Aspirin: 325mg once a day. The patient stated that stroke and heart problems do not run in her family. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 63-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 07Mar2021 18:00 as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has no medical history and concomitant medications. No history of previous vaccinations. No vaccinations in four weeks.  On 13Mar2021, 6 days after vaccination, the patient had nerve pain, back ache, hip ache, was not feeling well, and had blistering. The patient went to the urgent care/emergency room because of the back pain and was given Capscian which burned and acyclovir. On 17Mar2021, the patient had pain and rash. The patient&#39;s visited a dermatologist due to symptoms and was diagnosed with shingles which developed on the right side of her body on 21Mar2021. The dermatologist changed the acyclovir to valacyclovir at 1 gram three times a day and Triamcinolone Acetonide: ointment Dose: 0.1%, twice a day both starting on 23Mar2021. The patient was also given Lidocaine patch and Biofreeze. Patient states steroid ointment was very amazing and that was just yesterday it was started, already her rash is disappearing, blistering is going away. Dermatologist also said she hadn&#39;t been given the right antiviral. The patient requested reassurance that the first dose received would still be effective even though the patient thinks her immune system is obviously compromised (no treatment was reported), says her immune system took away guard for other virus, triggered but not caused it. Maybe just a theory my immune system is working overtime to produce antibodies from having received vaccine and maybe wasn&#39;t protecting from dormant chicken pox virus. Patient wanted to make sure the efficacy of first shot is still intact. Patient also stated second dose is scheduled for 29Mar2021 and she was wondering if she would be able to receive the second dose or if she would have to wait a period of time. The outcome of the event immune system is obviously compromised was unknown while for the rest of the events was recovering.

A 64-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Batch/lot number: EL1284, Expiry Apr2021, intramuscularly on 30Dec2020 02:15 (Dose 1), right arm as a single dose (age at vaccination 64 years old) for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included allergy (usually in the fall she has allergy problems).  Her age is considered high risk, works in medical profession (Surgical Tech). Concomitant medication included levocetirizine (Walgreen&#39;s generic) 5mg, tablet, by mouth, at night for allergy. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine last 30Dec(2020) and after 2 days (on 01Jan2021) she developed symptoms: Sore arms, severe sore throats, back ache/ back was sore, temperature was up / low grade temp (never high), coughing, body aches. Her back and her legs were sore. Her whole body was achy. It was &#34;like flu-ish kinda.&#34; She also had a headache. She started getting the sore throat and headache on 01Jan2021, and she felt a little cold on 02Jan2021. On 02Jan(2021), her first temperature was 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She states she had everything except for the GI issues. Around 02Jan(2021) or 03Jan(2021), her symptoms were progressively getting worse. She was told to get COVID tested. There were three exposures since Christmas Eve. So, she went and got a rapid COVID test (04Jan2021) and it came back negative. They also sent out a test that day. She was also tested for Strep (04Jan2021) too because her throat was so sore. It was almost like she had like thrush along with it. She states it was almost like a thrush because she had like a white tongue (onset 03Jan2021). Her throat was so sore, but it was a different kind of sore throat compared to a sore throat she has had before. She explains where the nasopharynx was at the top, it&#39;s almost like it was sore from there. It was sore to swallow, it was &#34;a bizarre sore throat.&#34; She clarified she noticed the &#34;thrushy&#34; part of her throat around 03Jan2021. The strep test ended up being negative but she believes she had thrush because she was given medication and the medication was clearing that up. However, she still had the symptoms. Because her symptoms only started a few days before, they thought she should maybe wait a couple of days and if she is not feeling any better, she should be retested (for COVID). She went back again yesterday (07Jan2021). She had another Rapid COVID test and also a flu swab and both tests came back negative. She mentions they also did another COVID test (the send out type) and she should get that back around 1pm to find out the results of that.  They also did a CBC (07Jan2021) and everything was normal. Her white count was at 7. She was waiting for the 3rd COVID test result today (08Jan2021).  She reported that about three days afterwards, she didn&#39;t notice the soreness in /her arm. Her throat has improved. Her fever was down to 98 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday (07Jan2021). She states she was feeling better today (08Jan2021). She commented &#34;the lethargy, though.&#34; She emptied the dishwasher yesterday (07Jan2021) and had to sit down after emptying it. She states her symptoms have her a little worried. She recovered from the sore arms in Jan2021. The patient was recovering from  the severe sore throat, back ache, low grade temp, coughing, body aches/ whole body was achy, believes she had thrush, white tongue, legs were sore, headache, and felt a little cold. The outcome of the event lethargy was not recovered. She was wondering if this was a reaction to the vaccine.

I could not been over without twinges of spasms. I could walk without problems--including up and downstairs (with extreme caution).  On 1/16/21 I started taking Bayer for Body and Back pain and using  Icy Hot on the area that hurt. I called my doctor&#39;s office for med for spasms and she said I need to see a doctor. I wanted to be compliant with her recommendations. The doctor suggested Extra Strength Tylenol every three hours.

                                                Has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands; She still has a cough and no taste; She still has a cough and no taste; The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot; Body aches; Chills; Nausea; Tired; Diarrhea; Had a fever reached 100.0; Joint hurt, all of them; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020 (8 weeks ago). Concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the vaccine, she got sick as a dog and couldn&#39;t work. She had a fever that reached 100.0, she had body aches. It was explained that she has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands. The caller continues that her joint hurt, all of them, but it was throbbing the most where she has visual arthritis. To sum it up, she had chills, nausea, and body aches the first day. The caller took Tylenol regardless of what the paper said; this was on Friday, 08Jan2021. She kept taking the Tylenol. The next day, she was still tired but when she quit taking the Tylenol on the 2nd day the symptoms returned. It was clarified that she took it in the beginning of the second day twice but at the end of the day wanted to see if she was over it all so she stopped the Tylenol. The symptoms all returned so she took again at bed time, the Tylenol, this was Saturday. On Sunday, she had diarrhea but only a couple times and though it was weird, after that is was over. That day she took Tylenol once. She was calling because she was scared about the second dose, this one produced a big immune response and she says that usually happens with the second dose. The caller wants to know if she should take the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to have this happen again or it be worse. She thought since she had already had COVID it wouldn&#39;t be as bad, her immune response. The first dose was given on 07Jan2021. It was explained the only thing unresolved was from when she had COVID, she still has a cough and no taste. There are just few thing she can taste and smell now. The patient said that all the symptoms had resolved as of Monday, the 11Jan2021. Actually, she felt pretty good on the 10Jan2021 so let&#39;s say Sunday. She explained that most people get this on the second dose and so if she going have a third response she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She was calling to get an answer to her question, the doctor told her to call to see what could be recommended. She has really good doctors, three of them. The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot. The patient said she really needs to go. No need to continue when there is no one to tell her if she should take the second shot or not. The patient asked to be contacted via email to relay information about people&#39;s immune response to the first dose verses the second dose, is it greater or less. Clinical outcome of the events recovered on 11Jan2021.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

A 64-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer&#39;s COVID Vaccine; lot number: EL1284; expiration date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration left upper arm on Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included lupus. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she got her first dose of the COVID Vaccine 2 weeks ago today (Jan2021), and this is her second dose next Saturday. She was a non-medicated, non-kind of remission level of lupus. She mentioned that she was okay the second day, she thinks. She had a little dizziness, fatigue and light headedness that kind of thing. But the top 3 or 4 days ago, so like on her 8th or 9th day, she started to get like inflammatory symptoms like arthritis pain in her hip, in her hand, in her wrist. It was also reported that the patient experienced inflammatory pain on an unspecified date. So, she was just wondering if there are any reports of people with lupus and if the other people have reported that. She mentioned that she wanted to get the second dose but was a little concerned if those arthritis symptoms are going to be worse. No treatment was received. The causality was reported as yes. The patient she hasn&#39;t gone visit any emergency room/ physician&#39;s office for the adverse events. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I had joint and body aches. I experienced lightheadedness when I got up when fever was 101.8 at 2:30 pm.  I had to lay down again and apply a wet towel. Once I felt able to walk (about 10 minutes later) I ate a popsicle and then proceeded to take two 325 mg of Tylenol. Within 30 to 45 minutes fever subsided. I then ate soup, crackers and an orange and drank cranapple juice. I went back to bed and slept some more. I woke up at 5 pm and had a cup of soup, a quarter of an apple and gatorade.

A 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 07Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital, not a Military Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient got the Flu Vaccine last part of Sep2020 or Beginning of Oct2020. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EK57530), via an unspecified route of administration at left Upper arm on 17Dec2020 9:10AM for covid-19 immunization. She only had a sore arm. It started the same day, a couple of hours after getting the vaccine. It went away a day to a day and a half after it started. After that she was fine. She got the second dose on 07Jan2021. After the second dose, immediately, like within five minutes her arm became very sore, this event was assessed as non-serious by HCP. Also, that Thursday (07Jan2021) night after getting the second dose of the Vaccine around 9PM-10PM she started to get chills, myalgia, severe headache, and nausea. She also mentioned she was so sick during the night she was not able to get up and around. She felt like she had a temperature and by the time it was checked her temperature was 101.9. She was febrile all through 08Jan2021. She started to become afebrile 09Jan2021 with improvement and by 10Jan2021 all her symptoms had gone away and completely resolved. Seriousness Criteria: Stated she felt these are serious. She was unable to go to work on Friday. She could not return back to work until Monday. The HCP assessed all events were related to the vaccine. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021. She stated, even though she got so sick with getting the vaccine she was just continuously telling her self this is better than having COVID. She stated she even told people even if she knew after getting the shot she would have this reaction she would still take it. She has seen death occur from COVID and does not want that to happen.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, clinical course and known safety profile of the product, the reported events chills, myalgia, severe headache, nausea and fever were likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Complete muscle, joint, entire deep body. WORST i ever had. then a few welps and even though 90% was under the skin rash husband and I could feel the 10 % was red, small pimple like IF not the neck welps and then on the 4  day  had a few hives on face only.  Worst itching I have ever had and I have had chicken pox and antibiotic rashes. I think the problem has been came off of antibiotic and gradually got ok but can not get this out of system so easy of course. Today is 1 week. rash is better but not gone and itching is some better but still not good. I did not take benadryl or anything since I DO NOT want to interfere with me getting as much benefit from the injection since I now can not have number 2.

The night and next day I had musculoskeletal pains, and tiredness.  The primary thing I would like to report is that starting on Saturday, Feb. 13th around 8 pm, I began with a cold sore, or fever blister of upper lip. Over the course of the next 24-36 hours, I developed at least 4 more fever blisters. I am not prone to fever blisters, and have never in my life had more than one, infrequently. They are on upper and lower lip, and one is even immediately below my lip, on my skin that is not mouth mucosa. They are painful .

                                                During the early morning hours within 12 hours of the vaccine I woke up to extreme pain in my right shoulder joint.  Any movement hurt intensely.  As the day went on I took acetaminophen which substantially decreased the pain of movement.  I did that twice during the waking hours the first day after the vaccine.  Within 2 days the pain was gone.

                                                3 weeks after the first dose I developed sudden onset severe myalgias in the cervical neck,  shoulders, deltoid, gluteal, and hamstring muscles.  These were my only symptoms at onset. No fever, No Sand S of infection, etc.  VItals were stable. Lab work, including complete chemistries CBCD, ESR, and CRP, was all WNL. However, 5 days after onset with no improvement in the myalgias, my creatinine kinase (CK)was 402 ( normal up to 175). Over a period of an additional 8 days, the myalgias have gradually decreased, and my current CK level, as of 2/17, is 275.  My physician is terming it autoimmune myositis and believes it is from the vaccine. I have also had some mild tingling in my hands and feet intermittently that started soon after the myalgias. No true neurological deficits.  No other symptoms. I am the patient but also a docotrally prepared nurse practitioner, so that is why this patient report is in medical terminology.

Then I passed out, I fell down and hit my face on the floor.  My family called 911 paramedica.  They ,measured d my blood pressure and it was too low. The area around my right eyebrow was swollen and my neck hurt as precaution I went to the hospital.  I suspect the incident and its symptom are side effects of the vaccine given the timing.  Later on I had headache off and on and brain fog.

I recovered fully, and have felt very good since mid January.  My reaction after my 1st dose of vaccine on Feb 25  started 20 hours after shot.  Worsened through the day and I got sicker at 24-36 hours, and then stayed in bed another day.  Symptoms were identical to my bout with COVID:  chills (no fever),  nausea, aches in joints and muscles, fatigue.  They were quite significant==I could not be out of bed.  As it went along I also developed the feeling in my chest like COVID--tough to take deep breath, chest hurt---but my O2 readings were fine.   Recovered after 48 hours, People who have had COVID should be aware that they will have a significant response to the vaccine on the 1st does.  I am questioning having a second dose I have not reported this to my doctor

                                                One and a half hours after the  vaccine, I suddenly became very dizzy and had a hard time focusing. I was extremely happy that I was NOT driving.  I could not think straight and had sweat pouring down my face. My head was very heavy and as the day progressed, my neck also became sore. I took Advil and later Tylenol and they helped the head ache but not the dizziness. I lost appetite. I consulted the reading material about the vaccine and all of my symptoms were normal side effects, so I did not seek medical assistance. My daughter is a doctor and wanted me to report for statistical reasons.

Dizziness continued for 2 days. Neck pain improved somewhat but is still bothering me, woke me up at night. Now a week later and my neck still hurts.  I called my primary care office on March 3 and they said call 211. That made no sense so I asked again and they finally said I could see a nurse practitioner the next day. However I didn?t go because I couldn?t drive.  I am a little worried about the second dose.

I recommend you get tested for COVID just to rule out whether you have COVID or not, if test comes back positive you would have to wait till the symptoms subside prior to getting your second dose.

Pt reports got her second covid vaccine on 3/92021 in the left arm, Pfizer. Yesterday (3/10/21) woke up with severe right knee pain, felt like she could not bear weight/ws going to fall. She went to son&#39;s apartment who is in same building and then went to lie down in bedroom. Because she drinks a lot of water, she had to get up to go to bathroom to urinate. She was about to sit down on toilet, when she felt both her legs go numb as well as her arms and her vision was blurred. She tried to grab the tub but fell forward on the floor. She states she urinated on the floor. She was on the floor for about 30 mins until her son got her up and back to bed. Later in the day she needed to urinate again and when she got up, she felt unsteady and fell on the bureau bruising the left arm.  Since she feels a bit unsteady with gait and used a walker to come hre today. She denies feeling dizzy before her falls. She denies striking her head. She denies convulsions or hx of seizure disorder. She reports no new meds, only recent change an increase in her alprazolam dose. She does report a headache day after her vaccine.&#39;She denies vomiting or diarrhea or antecedent illness. No longer has headache. She denies positional changes Of note she is on propranolol (prescribed by psych) as well as lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide for HTN  64 yo female with bipolar disorder on multiple psych meds, htn on propranolol 20 mg bid and lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide, s/p recent Pfizer covid vaccine, s/p presyncope episode after experiencing severe right knee pain and attempted micturition.

Some neck pain and traveling from neck to scalp. Today is 3/17/21 and the symptoms are still present but somewhat improved over the last week. The sensations are now mostly on the R side. I took Advil 400mg TID for 2 days and also applied a heating pad to the neck and back of head. I saw my PCP today as this is causing me a lot of anxiety, she prescribed Prednisone 40mg daily X 3 days.

                                                Flushed face, burning and tingling, tight. Started within 8 minutes of injection. 30 minutes later it spread to back of the neck and went up through the scalp at the back of the head to the crown of the head. Headache the whole time.  Face returned to normal in 90 minutes. Scalp in 2  1/2 hours. Muscles aches starting in left arm, moved to left leg and then to right leg. Headache is persistent but mild 4 hours later.

                                                This was my second COVID vaccine.  At 23.5 hours since the shot every joint in my body lit up and my whole body felt like dead weight. I started coughing as well.  I left work, went straight home and was in bed by 5:00PM.  I slept all night, got up @ 4:30 AM and went to work. I felt 100% better. Just my shoulders kind of ached and my back was achy but that has mostly subsided by 11:00 AM today.

                                                Almost immediately I felt a tightening on the back of my neck.  It was familiar to me; I feel exactly that same symptom when I eat something with MSG.  Within minutes I felt light headed and exhausted.  I went to the pharmacist and he gave me Benadryl; I don&#39;t know the exact amount, but it was in the small cup that comes with different kinds of meds.  It made no difference, so I had to call my husband to pick me up.  I was very, very tired so I slept for the next 3 hours.  I went back to bed 2 hours later and slept through the night.  I was up the next day and by 11 am was very tired; I slept for 4 hours, then again through the night.  By the next day, I felt normal.

                                                Upper back soreness began ~ 4-5 days after injection. then it began to migrate from the whole upper back to the left side near the deltoid and trapezius and get stronger. Then migrate up my neck.  It tends to move and is not related to any individual muscle.   The pain did not respond to heat, stretching, or massage.  It made it feel worse at times.   I am very tolerant of pain and rarely take painkillers.  I began taking aspirin, oil, then Advil.  Then I was in such pain 10 days after the shot,  I searched and found my leftover emergency  from my hip surgeries.  This back and neck pain was more painful to me than hip surgery!

                                                Aside from the soreness of the left arm where I was injected, the left side of my neck and esophagus is sore and I have numbness on the left side of my face. The numbness is on the left jaw, the cheek, the eye brow and forehead.  It&#39;s itchy and tingly.  It feels somewhat like when a part of the body is coming out of being asleep and it tingles.  This is the second day of the numbness. I did not expect this reaction to this COVID-19 vaccination and I have never had such a reaction to vaccinations in the past.  I read on the internet of people getting Bell&#39;s palsy from the COVID-19 shot and wondered if this is similar.  With this reaction from the first COVID-19  shot, I&#39;m concerned what my reaction might be if/when I have the 2nd vaccination.

It was really tight.  My ears itched.  This lasted 20 minutes.  That night I had severe bone and muscle pain in my upper legs.  I cried all night.  the next day I started taking Tylenol.  This helped.  My upper legs still hurt but I can stand it now.

A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6201, expiry date: Jun2021), in left arm, shoulder area, on 09Mar2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 64-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included multiple sclerosis (MS), cervical myelopathy, and arthritis that was bone on bone in her right hip. No COVID prior vaccination and no COVID tested post vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. Family medical history relevant to AEs was reported as no. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications included ongoing duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA), ongoing baclofen, ongoing calcium, ongoing multivitamins (vitamins NOS), ongoing tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX), ongoing ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin D3, diclofenac sodium (VOLTAREN). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient reported fever post vaccination. She was told by a nurse to not take MOTRIN but TYLENOL 24 hours after receiving the vaccine. The patient got the vaccine on 09Mar2021 and was told she could not take her MOTRIN. She had multiple sclerosis, cervical myelopathy, and arthritis that was bone on bone in her right hip. She told not to take pain relievers for 24 hours after the shot as it would cause something to happen with the vaccine. Patient explained that when someone had all these different things, it was hard to be told that they could not take medications. After the vaccine, she could not walk good and had a fever. The fever and the other events started on 10Mar2021, about 3am. She could not walk well at 3am in the morning when she got up. When a person had multiple sclerosis, whenever anything happened it took out their legs. It was also noted that she had muscle aches after the shot on 10Mar2021 at 3 am, all of that too. This was getting better. The patient was told she could take TYLENOL and relayed she did take a couple TYLENOL for the fever. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or to physician office. Relevant tests were reported as no. No treatment was administered for muscle ache and walking difficulty. The patient was recovering from the events.

I was able to go out to the grocery store. Around 1 p.m. on Tuesday, I began feeling inflammation on the gums of my teeth, and roof of my mouth felt like it was burned; it got so bad that I could not eat or drink due to tongue hitting the roof of my mouth &amp; causing MUCH pain.  I did the best I could on Wednesday but then could no longer take it. I contacted my doctor who prescribed viscous lidocaine in order for me to eat &amp; drink. I was only able to eat very soft food. My doctor had not come across anyone with this side effect. But the lidocaine helped a lot and I had to use it for several days. Symptoms started to subside on Saturday and are improving daily but it is still very sensitive even as of this time, 10 days after this 2nd vaccine shot.

This 64-year-old female patient reported for herself that she received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Batch/lot number: ER8731) via an unspecified route in the left arm on 18Apr2021 at 12:15 (at the age of 64-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included tick bite, blood pressure, nerve pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and sciatica. The patient had no family history. The patient had no other prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) of the COVID vaccine. Ongoing concomitant medications included olmesartan for blood pressure, duloxetine for nerve pain, omeprazole for GERD, famotidine for GERD; all taken for years, meloxicam for sciatica taken for 2 months and ongoing and doxycycline from 16Apr2021 and ongoing for tick bite (reported that she kept forgetting to take it). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8727) on 28Mar2021 at 12:00 in the left arm as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. That dose went in the deltoid and she had no issues. Then she received the second dose on 18Apr2021 at 12:15 in the left arm. She believes it was administered in the soft tissue behind the deltoid. She noticed the person who gave the injection went behind the muscle toward the back of the arm. The next day after the second dose, she felt fine. Then the second morning it felt as if her shoulder was dislocated; and her breast is hard and painful; and she can&#39;t breath. She called her doctor who said that was not a common side effect but she stated she knows it is a side effect. The doctor recommended she go to the ER but patient didn&#39;t want to go. She stated that she doesn&#39;t know if missing the muscle is going to let the medication absorb or if it has penetrated the soft tissue. The clinical course of events was further described as follows: On 20Apr2021 at 08:00, the second morning, she woke up and felt severe pain in her right breast and shoulder all the way to back; adds she can&#39;t move her arm and her breast is so painful she can&#39;t touch it and her shoulder is immobile. She is also having very bad shortness of breath, adds she thought that may be from anxiety; so later in the day she took a alprazolam (XANAX). She added that she put up with the pain all morning and thought maybe she was working herself up so she took one half of a Xanax to calm down, to see if it was just anxiety but the shortness of breath and pain were still there. She reported she was continuing to feel all of these effects at the same level. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the ER because of the expense. The shoulder pain was going down her back to the trapezius. She clarified that she can move her shoulder and her arm, but the pain was so breathtaking that she doesn&#39;t move it and she has her arm in a sling. There were no relevant tests performed. The clinical outcome of the events right breast pain, breast is hard, shoulder pain, shoulder pain going down her back, shortness of breath, can&#39;t move shoulder/arm/ shoulder is immobile, and anxiety was not recovered. The patient mentioned that she doesn&#39;t know if not getting the shot in the deltoid caused her symptoms or not.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, at age 64 years, administered in left arm on 05Apr2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8734) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, in order to go back to normal, without a mask so she was told she had to have one. Medical history included hysterectomy, anxiety, disorder in thyroid and cholesterol. Patient had family history of dementia, had to stay home and take care of her mom who is a heart patient and has dementia. Patient had no history of previous immunizations. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes unspecified medications one is for thyroid, one is for cholesterol and the other 2 are for anxiety. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. Patient&#39;s symptoms started with a headache the morning after the shot (05Apr2021), was on and off for a couple of days, lasted 3 days or so for a couple days and she took paracetamol (TYLENOL). On 09Apr2021, Friday morning, patient woke up so nauseous she couldn&#39;t hold anything down. It was just bile coming up, and she had severe diarrhea and so sick vomiting that wouldn&#39;t stop, stomach pain, couldn&#39;t hold her own weight up. She got medication at a walk in clinic and that didn&#39;t stop it. She started out at acute/urgent care, where she was taken by her daughter on Sunday, 11Apr2021, because she was feeling so bad and was tested for COVID and they said if it does not get better to go to the Emergency Room and she continued having problems. It was not COVID. They said she was dehydrated and send her home to push fluids and drink Pedialyte. Monday or Tuesday (Apr2021) she was in the ER all night (she does not remember the day because all of her days are mixed up). They did CAT scans on her abdomen and ran blood work. They didn&#39;t see anything in her abdomen. Her white blood cell count and kidney and liver function were all elevated and they said it was from being dehydrated from diarrhea and vomiting. They gave her fluids and sent her home. Within another 48 hours she still had vomiting and diarrhea, it was a clear bile and a sharp pain in her side. Her stools were dark tarry stringy stuff so she went back to the ER and waited in the lobby for 9 hours. In that 9 hours as she was waiting, she felt like she had to go to the bathroom. She was then wheeled into the bathroom and started passing blood. It wasn&#39;t coming from the urethra. It must have come form the vagina, she doesn&#39;t have a uterus. There were clots. She started passing blood in her urine but most was in the vaginal area but she has already had a hysterectomy. She was passing clots and her doctor who works in the healthcare field looked at it and said they were clots. Very shortly after, she passed the clot and the pain went away. The pain was passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area at one point went away but she still have nausea and diarrhea and they gave her more fluids and sent her home. They didn&#39;t really want to address the vaginal bleeding. Patient have not been back and was not sure if she is still dehydrated. Patient was still pushing fluids and still not back to normal. Patient&#39;s daughter told her that since it was 5 days later it was not a reaction. Patient was thinking maybe it was an allergic internal severe reaction. Patient was weighing 130 pounds but lost about 4 pounds during this illness, so 4 pounds lighter. She stated her daughter-in-law was doing research and found a blog and there are woman the caller&#39;s age complaining of these symptoms (unexplained bleeding) after the vaccine. She asked if this was from the vaccine. She stated she was so sick that if there is even a chance then she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She asked if this is a coincidence or has it been reported. She stated she is trying to make a decision on if she should get the second dose because she heard other people have symptoms and take the second shot. The outcome of the events passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area, headache, a sharp pain in her side, passing blood in her urine, passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area/vaginal bleeding was recovered on Apr2021, while for the other events, it was unknown.

                                                9 to 10 days after administration I started with left shoulder and bicep pain.  vaccine was given low in the arm and away from the joint so I did not get concerned at the beginning.  The pain has progressed despite range of motion exercises, ibuprofen, heat and topical steroid cream.  It has affected the use of my arm and I started myself on 30 mg of prednisone today with concern of SIRVA.  I am unable to seek any medical care at this time as I am driving my husband for cancer treatment and won&#39;t be home until Saturday the 9th of January.  I wanted to report these symptoms so if anyone else has similar symptoms it can be counted.

Awoke at 3:40 am and rolled off of arm where injection given and a wave of pain and nausea and malaise overwhelmed me. I passed completely out still lying in bed (so out that I wet myself in bed) and gradually came to, still feeling horrible. Got up, changed clothes, and major chills when I returned to bed. Around 6am I felt nauseous, got up to vomit, but instead passed completely out on the bathroom floor for about 15 minutes.  Remainder of day I felt very stiff, low energy and slightly woozy. By afternoon, energy was returning (I vacuumed the house). Minimal pain in arm this time compared to previous.

                                                Second COVID vaccine on 1/14/21 - The patient is  received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine at Hospital.   Post dose she experienced intermittent sensation of tingling on left posterior neck area with no paresthesia and difficulty lifting bilateral extremities.  Three days after administration of the vaccine she began noticing weakness in her legs that eventually progressed to her arms bilaterally.   She developed pitting edema and SOB.   Per infectious disease MD, the main suspicion is for GBS Guillain-Barre Syndrome given exam findings. Pt&#39;s weakness and resulting inability to ambulate may have pushed pt into CHF exacerbation.   Patient received 3 days of IVIG which was discontinued due to worsening mental status.   Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.

The patient thinks she could have COVID last Mar2020. She was not sure because her doctor&#39;s office was close for around a month and she couldn&#39;t get tested. There were no concomitant medications. On that day, 19Jan2021, after she received the vaccine she started feeling pain in the injection site, joint pain, muscle pain and fatigue. On 25Jan2021, she was feeling pretty bad, she doesn&#39;t want to eat, her back hurts, she&#39;s irritable and depressed. The patient would like to know if these side effects could be associated with the vaccine in someone who had the virus. She felt awful and she felt like she has gone right back to where she was 8 months ago, 10 months ago and started over with fatigue and everything. It was awful. She thinks she could have had COVID in Mar2020 and the symptoms she was having now, she had then and when she has had basically the whole time and that would just come back worse. There was no treatment received for the events. The outcome for the events was unknown.

Experienced myalgia  and severe migraine-like headache with light sensitivity. The arm pain from shoulder to mid-palm was so severe that I couldn?t lift my arm. This resolved by approximately noon on 02/10/2021. The other symptoms largely resolved by midday 02/11/2021 wit residual low-grade headache, dizziness, and unsteadiness on my feet.  I woke up on 02/11/2021 around 7AM with left axillary lymphadenopathy approximately the size of a tennis ball cut in half with associated moderate discomfort. The discomfort resolved by 02/14/2021, but the lymphadenopathy remains at about half the mass noticed originally.

Approximately one hour after receiving the vaccine patient experienced right side of neck and face up to eye becoming numb and tight. Tongue got a little numb also. Over the next two hours the symptoms lightened up and by morning just felt like she had a numbing agent at the dentist along right lip, nostril and check.

She felt like her feet were in cinderblocks.  She took some Tylenol, and woke up at 4:00 AM and had two severe headaches and nausea since Sunday.  That night she felt as though she could not stand it any longer.  Went to UC and they tested her for the virus which was negative, and still having symptoms.  She thought the symptoms would get less, but it has been quite a few days.  She takes a short walk and the intense pain in her arms, and legs are terrible.   Her PCP told her that there was nothing they could do, and what she had been doing what she needed to do.  They also told her to go back to UC if she did not improve.

Then my joints started hurting almost like a nerve was firing off but only at the joints, ie knee, shoulder, toes, ankle, fingers, toes, etc. It would happen randomly. Never all joints at once. Very weird. Continued throughout the night making it difficult to sleep. In the morning, at 7 am, got up out of bed. Took 2 Advil. At 10:20 I  still have the joint happening but not as frequent and not as strong. I still have the headache. It hasn&#39;t changed.

I remained in the waiting area for over a half hour and felt no worse, but did report it to the young woman at the exit who said that was odd and seemed the kind of response with the second dose. I presumed it might be due to my already having antibodies. As I continued my day those symptoms quickly dispersed and I felt fine, albeit with a light soreness at the site on my left arm. At approximately 6pm I felt very fatigued and rested until 10pm, when I began to have chills, a headache and nausea. My left arm was also so sore I could not lay comfortably. I took Tylenol and aspirin both at 11:30 pm and attempted to sleep, which was fitful and disturbing. I had strange neurological events, such as odd visions in my half sleep and bizarre semi dreams but could not waken. At 4:00 AM I finally was able to pull out of this state and the last thing in my mind was a conversation with someone trying to explain what was happening to me, in my mind not vocal, that was in Italian. That is my second language. All day I had unwanted words, ideas etc. floating about in my brain. I could no longer sleep and was very weak, had terrible head and body aches and my legs also ached terribly. I was also slightly nauseous.These were all symptoms, minus the disturbing neurological one, that I had with Covid. I was too weak to leave the bed until much later in the day. I am still having effects but much less and I am at the 72 hour mark. I remained at rest all day and ran a low fever, then again a fever

Starting 2/4 intensity started to vary i.e  no pain  during hot shower but still severe pain majority of time. Slight reduction breast pain as spread to back pain and movement seems to help. On night of 2/3 spread to back ? shot side line of nodes paralleling spine  and shoulder/neck area-  back pain not as severe as original breast area and heat helps to reduce back pain Pain interferes with sleep - 2/4 finally able to get 4 hours sleep ( hot shower temporary relief while showering)( normal is 7 hrs) As of 2/5 still in moderate to severe breast area pain almost continuously. Hope I am recovering but its 10 days and still mostly constant incapacitating pain. Very slight intermittent node pain by Feb 17 when got second shot in other arm per Physician Assistant?s recommendation. So far after 51 hours 2nd shot adverse effects minimal and does not interfere with thinking or sleeping

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

                                                I had injection site discomfort, about 4-6 hours after vaccination. I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: L9261) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 27Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Sjogren&#39;s syndrome from 2015 (sees her Rheumatologist/ do blood work once a year to make sure her inflammation levels are okay), ongoing rosacea; dry eye syndrome (related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome); spasming, burning and twitching (last 2 medications she was on in November and January she had similar type reactions in her muscles); arthritis flareup from Oct2019 (in her left leg, she saw her neurologist who did tests and they came back normal) and sinus infection in 2020. Ongoing concomitant medication included ciclosporin (RESTASIS) for Sjogren&#39;s syndrome, ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) for blood test: deficient and ascorbic acid, betacarotene, cupric oxide, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION) for dry eye syndrome related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient previously took prednisone from Nov2020 and experienced weirdness in her legs got strong enough to keep her up at night and bad flare up for her leg symptoms; metronidazole for flare up or Rosacea (0.75% as needed, which she has used daily for last few weeks), meloxicam in Nov2020 and pantoprazole in Jan2021 and had bad flare up for her leg symptoms (symptoms subsided as soon as she stopped taking the medication after about 5 days); ibuprofen, acetaminophen and pepcid for her stomach. She had the vaccine, her first dose, on 27Jan2021, about a week ago. The first two days she didn&#39;t notice anything and then she had weird sensations in her legs on 28Jan2021. The second night she had a weird sensation in her legs which was similar to what she had experienced with the two medications she took in November and January. On 30Jan2021 the sensations spread through her body, she describes these sensations as twitching, burning, cramping, and tingling. She clarifies the sensations moved to her arms which did not happen with the other medications that she tried in November and January. Monday night, 01Feb2021, she was up all night and couldn&#39;t sleep and says she called the family doctor yesterday and he called in a prescription for Gabapentin 100 mg. She said she took the medication last night and she did sleep last night, but she was unsure if it was from exhaustion from the last few nights from not sleeping or the medicine, but she did sleep better and her symptoms were a lot less last night. Patient said she wanted to report this and that her concern is with the second dose; will she have a worse reaction, is there anything she can do or take and should she be concerned about it. She said the events gradually increased, they started mildly and then became significant. She felt the sensations a little bit in the day time but they start big time in the night when laying down. These sensations experienced in her legs started the second night, 28Jan2021, and then spread to her arms in the last couple of days which had not happened with her other incidences (with the medications mentioned above back in November and January). Clarified that the sensations spread to her arms on 29Jan2021, but the worst nights were 31Jan2021 and 01Feb2021. She said they were bad nights. She said in regard to her sleeping, starting on 29Jan2021, she was restless, she had trouble getting sleep and trouble getting in a comfortable position. She woke up frequently. Saturday the sleeping was a little worse, but she did sleep. She said on Sunday, 31Jan2021, and Monday, 01Feb2021, she hardly got any sleep. The sensations spread to her arms and it probably started a little on Saturday night, but Sunday and Monday it was very noticeable. She started Gabapentin; it was one a day before bed. The leg symptoms were still there last night. The sensations in her arms were not much at all. She did get up once with the leg cramp and was feeling tightness in her left leg but it never went into a cramp. The cramp was in her right leg, which was unusual because it was usually in her left leg. She stated she was unsure if her symptoms were starting to subside or if the Gabapentin had an immediate effect. The events did not require a visit to physician or ER. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Had all of the side effects, chills, fever, muscle aches, joint pain and a wicked headache. Monday was the same minus the headache. Today, still have joint pain and feel very weak. The nurse that gave us our vaccinations said that if we experienced any of the side effects, we should let our primary physician know.  Hopefully all of this is normal and I will be back to my normal self soon. I am concerned because most of the information I have read says 24 hours and effects should be gone. Not so with me.

                                                She did not have any reactions initially, but noticed the morning after the vaccine that her regular cup of coffee did not taste good.  She then had a rash that started on the left side of her neck, went towards the back now.  This started a few days after the vaccine, all on the left side.  She also got a cold sore on her lip which she had all the time as a child, but not as an adult, which has pretty much resolved.  She has been cold, chills and some dizzy spells.  She did get a bump on her head concussion in December.  One day last week she just stayed on the sofa with a blanket due to feeling poorly.  3 days ago on her back by her shoulder blade an area has been really sore.  She did take some Tylenol for the back pain which did not help so she stopped this.   She did not call her doctor.    The rash is still there but not as intense.  It has not itched, but she has felt it.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 11:30 at single dose (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization.

The nurse practitioner at the doctor&#39;s office was wondering if it could have been an interaction between the Medrol pack and the vaccine. She got an email saying she could get the vaccine, but didn&#39;t think to call the doctor office to ask about the Medrol pack (steroid pack) or if it could cause any interactions. So the office told her to call. Later mentions along with the Medrol pack, she got an injection in the office of Toradol and this was before getting the vaccine.  She stated that she did have her on a steroid pack for a pulled muscle so that may have exacerbated the issue. The weakness and things have improved so she was still a little nervous and uses a walker and just making sure to take it easy today.

The patient had no Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The patient had no events following prior vaccinations. Patient stated that they had been lucky and they have been tested before and has not had it yet, so that was why they wanted to get the vaccine done. She just rested and her husband helped her to bed since she didn&#39;t feel well last night. She did not have any trouble breathing. Patient underwent a Chest x-ray in Jan2021 and nothing showed up on it, but just some old calcifications from many years ago. That was done sometime last week and she also had like 3 MRI&#39;s on an unspecified date. Patient was wondering if she should she get the second dose. Her next appointment was on 16Feb2021. She was pretty banged up and does not want to have to go through that again. Outcome of events was recovering.

I had to actually get out of bed to try and relieve the cramping.    I was cold and muscles were cramping but with extra blankets  was able to fall back to sleep.  Woke up in the morning  feeling very sore with  muscle pain/aches.  Neck was so sore I could barely keep my head up.  My whole body hurt, had a bad headache and fever of 100.4 when I finally took it.  For the next 24 hours all I wanted to do was sleep.  When I woke up the following morning still had a slight headache that went away as day progressed.  Just thought you might want to hear about this.  Not sure what you do with this information but hope it is helpful.

Symptoms resolved with food, water, and time Second Reaction: About 36 hours later while doing dishes, felt prickly on both sides of my neck. Both sides of my neck turned pink as though I had a sunburn. Broke out in profuse sweating.  Called my doctor who was on call that night. He told me to get Benadryl  right away and to keep taking it until symptoms subsided. If they did not subside or got worse I was to go to urgent care, or ER. Treatment: Benadryl every 4-6 hours for 2 days. As each dose wore off I waited to see if the symptoms came back and then took more Benadryl. Issue lasted until Saturday night - 2 days.

The worst of it lasted about 5 minutes but weakness and shaking continued for about an hour.  2) Over the course of several hours developed sore arm and headache which worsened over the next 12 hours but was not terribly bad.  3) Days 3-6 had stiffness which began at injection site and went up left shoulder into the left side of neck.  Resolved by day 7.  4) ON DAY EIGHT I developed a rash and itching at the injection site.  Also had a dry cough and sinus drainage but cannot be certain this was from the vaccination but the rash and itching definitely was.  The rash resolved by day 12.  It was not terribly bad and no drugs were needed to calm the itch.

                                                Exactly twelve hours after getting the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I experienced severe chills for three gruesome hours that rattles my teeth, plus fever, fatigue, &amp; joint pain (especially in my elbows, fingers, shoulder, knees, and back) and headache.  My fever ranged from 100 degrees F to 102 degrees F for 36 hours.  After consultation with my doctor at the 16 hour mark past vaccination, I took Tylenol every 6 hours to reduce my fever, which helped tremendously.  These side effects lasted 36 hours almost to the minute then were gone.

After my second dose I had chills, lethargy and severe joint and body pain (difficult to sleep) which improved after 36 hours--except worsening of left knee pain--by 3/5/21 I was unable to stand, walk or move my left knee due to pain.  I self treated with Naprosyn (400 mg bid) and went to urgent care on 3/6/21.  The XRAY was negative with slight effusion.  I have had no injuries or trauma to my leg. I am a physician and have had psoriasis and PsA for about 25 years--have on and off medical care (topical steriods, creams and NSAIDS).  Due to my &#43;BRCA2 gene I have not taken stronger immuno-suppressive therapies.

I saw Dr. the end of February for another issue and just mentioned in the past 2 weeks increased tingling in my feet and up to lower half of my legs. I was also having shooting pains in my feet which seems to be getting worse as of today. I?ll call Dr. to report this tomorrow. The pain keeps me awake at night and even wakes me up.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2; Lot number EL0140 for both doses, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration to right deltoid on 23Dec2020 at 15:00 single dose, and second dose via an unspecified route of administration to right deltoid on 13Jan2021 15:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunization, hepatitis a vaccine (HEPATITIS A) intramuscular on 29Dec2020 at single dose for immunization and varicella zoster vaccine rge (cho) (SHINGRIX) intramuscular from 29Dec2020 at single dose for immunization. Medical history included osteoporosis from 2011, osteoarthritis from an unknown date, Knee replacement (Reported due to the osteoarthritis, she had her one knee replaced in 2004 and her other knee replaced in 2011), Spinal compression fracture in 2011 (Reported she fell at work and had a spinal compression fracture in 2011. She said the spinal compression fracture was repaired by a vertebroplasty in 2011) and Hypothyroidism (she has had hypothyroidism for a long time, since either 1998 or 2000). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced rhabdomyolysis on 06Feb2021, fatigue extreme/felt tired on 30Dec2020, myalgia on 30Dec2020, pain on 30Dec2020, petechia on 06Feb2021, muscle cramps/muscle spasms on 17Feb2021, dry skin on Feb2021, itching on Feb2021 and her cpk was over 2400 on an unspecified date. The patient was hospitalized for rhabdomyolysis from 06Feb2021 to 09Feb2021 and reported to have caused disability. All the other events were reported as medically significant. She said she wanted to report to Pfizer that she was admitted to the hospital on 06Feb2020. She said she was in rhabdomyolysis, and the rhabdomyolysis was really bad. She said she had so much fatigue, myalgia, and pain that she couldn&#39;t walk. She said she was given a lot of fluids while she was in the hospital. She said her CPK was over 2400 when she was admitted to the hospital on 06Feb2021. She said she had so much fatigue, myalgia, and pain that she couldn&#39;t walk. She said she has a petechia rash, cramps, muscle spasms, dry skin and itching now. Reported she literally saved herself from dialysis by going to the hospital. She said she kept putting off her symptoms, and took Tylenol and Naproxen for the whole month of Jan2021. She said her symptoms started brewing up from day 1, clarifying that her symptoms were not really bad until 30Dec2020 and 31Dec2020. She clarified on 30Dec2020 she took Naproxen, Ibuprofen, and Tylenol for her symptoms, and nothing helped her. She said she knew her symptoms were not normal for her, and she went for the whole month of Jan2021 with her symptoms. She said finally there came a time when she said &#34;oh no, this is not normal at all&#34;, and she told herself she needed to check in at the hospital. She said she took Naproxen and Tylenol, and felt a little better, and drove herself to the hospital. Reported she kept walking and taking medicines, and while at work she diverted her mind from her symptoms, but when she came home she felt tired, and would tell herself she couldn&#39;t do it anymore. She said she doesn&#39;t know if what she experienced was from the COVID-19 Vaccine, but that definitely she had a reaction to either the Hepatitis A booster, the Shingrix Vaccine, or the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Reported she received 11 bags of Normal Saline (1000ml per bag) while she was in the hospital. She said fluid resuscitation was the only way to bring her CPK levels down and to treat the rhabdomyolysis. Reported her symptoms have improved. She said her last CPK was 134 on Wednesday, 17Feb2021. Reported she had cramps and severe muscle spams in her right leg on 17Feb2021, and then had cramps and muscle spasms in her left leg the following day. She said the cramps and muscle spams have not gone away completely. Reported she has a small petechia rash on her lower legs. She said at the moment the petechia rash shows up on her leg, she knows she is going to have a muscle spasm in that area. She said last night she had 2 petechia rashes show up on the lateral side of her right ankle. She said the petechia rash started to burn, and her right leg calf muscle became heavy. She said she could tell her right leg calf muscle was going to start to spasm, so she took some coconut oil and applied the coconut oil to her right leg calf muscle and massaged her right calf muscle. She said she had 2 areas of petechia last night (23Feb2021). She said the first time the petechia was noticed was when she went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021. She said the petechia has been persisting since that time. She said prior to being admitted to the hospital she never had dry skin or itching, but now she has dry skin and itching. She said she was using coconut oil to keep her skin moist. She stated she had 2 telehealth calls (11Feb2021 &amp; 18Feb2021) because of a petechia rash and muscle cramps and was asking her doctor is she may need to go back to the hospital. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work, CBC and Thyroid level on 06Jan2021 with unknown results (she had regular blood work done for her yearly checkup on 06Jan2021 (BMP, CBC, and Thyroid level). Also included CPK on 06Feb2021 greater than 2400, CPK on 09Feb2021 566 and CPK on 17Feb2021 134 (units were unspecified), She said her last CPK was 134 on Wednesday, 17Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of rhabdomyolysis, fatigue extreme/felt tired, myalgia, pain, muscle cramps/muscle spasms, her CPK was over 2400. Outcome of the event rhabdomyolysis, fatigue extreme/felt tired, myalgia, pain and her cpk was over 2400 was recovering. Outcome of petechia, muscle cramps/muscle spasms, dry skin and itching was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded. The Hepatitis A booster and the Shingrix Vaccine may have also played a contributory role. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Extreme migraine. Head pain, neck pain, nausea, vomiting,, dizziness, overall weakness, light sensitivity.  I have migraine disease but since I began Aimovig injections nearly a year ago I have very few migraines,  Those I have had have been extremely mild, just headache usually relieved by otc meds. Additionally I have not had nausea and vomiting with any migraine episode for many years.  When I woke at yesterday morning, I was in extreme pain across the right side and back of my head and down to my neck and shoulders. 9 out 10. I took my prescription, Eletriptan .5 mg at 5:45 and went back to bed.  It gave little relief of symptoms. I was unable to sleep and at about 7 a.m. I was hit with waves of nausea and extreme violent vomiting. This last for several minutes. At approximately 9 a.m. I took a 2nd dose of Eletriptan and slept a little. Again at about 11: a.m. I was hit with another round of extreme nausea and vomiting which lasted about 5-6 minutes. I slept a bit and around 3 p.m. was finally able to drink a little water. Still very weak but pain had subsided significantly, down to about a 4 / 10.  By 6 pm. I was almost pain free ? symptom free though very weak still. Ate a little at about 7 p.m.  I know this was a migraine which I am diagnosed with but it was extreme even for me, and especially in recent years. It was very  unusual in timing and severity  and I felt it needed reporting.

                                                No side effects were experienced until 2 days after I received the vaccine.  Two days after I received the vaccine I experienced enlarged lymph nodes on the left side of my back. I experienced pain when I pressed on my back. The pain felt like sore muscles so I used a heating pad which did not alleviate the issue. The enlarged lymph nodes continued to increase to include pain from my left arm pit down my left arm to my forearm and shoulder blade. It also increased down my back into my left buttock and upper thigh. As of today, March 16, 2021 at 3pm, the pain has slightly decreased.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine she experienced a very strong, pungent and sharp taste and smell, which passed within 5 minutes.  In those 5 minutes the next thing was tingling in her face, cheeks, lips and her sinuses which were not clogged up at the time cleared, which stayed that way until Saturday morning.  She did have tingling and numbness in her fingers, but nothing in her feet, and did not extend beyond her face and cheeks.  Then 20 minutes later at 1:55 PM her tongue became sort of thick and a little numb, but did not swell.   The area between her tongue and mouth tightened and her jaw tightened but nothing swelled.  No itching in the throat.  She had some sort of aching like menstrual cramps but has had a hysterectomy.  She did also have a headache, took a Tylenol at 2:15 and went to sleep.  When she woke up had fatigue, sore arm, and everything else had passed other than the lips feeling prickly and numb.  The tongue was no longer tight or in the jaw.  Just still had the open sinuses and the headache.  The most significant thing was the thickness and lack of feeling of her tongue.   By Saturday she was fine other than the normal side effects, soreness of arm, no red rash, but had been  moving it around.

Friday I felt no better - by evening I felt swelling in my neck and chest area. Noticeable swelling in clavicle area on both sides.

This time I am having more effects. Immediately I had blurred vision in my right eye and facial muscle tightening.  Upon arriving home I  became severely fatigued and and still am 24 hours later.  As of 16 hours later I developed severe pain in the right arm only, body aches, loss of taste and various facial tightening sensations and swelling tongue (I took Zyrtec for the latter and that helps). NO anaphylaxis.  THese may go away in the next day or so but that is as yet unknown.

Severe pain on left side of chest, left breast and pain radiating over shoulder to back on left side. On scale of 1-10, the pain was a 9. Extreme heaviness on both sides of chest. I could breath but seemed difficult to take deep breaths. Took an extra dose of my blood pressure meds and it eased the pain to a 4-5 and I was finally able to sleep at 1:00 AM.  Starting on March 8, 2021 I began having severe night sweats and continue to have them at present (March 25, 2021). Dr does not recommend that I take the second vaccination due to my reaction to the first one. He did recommend that I take the Johnson &amp; Johnson but the health department is stating that I have to complete my vaccinations with the same on I started with. I will not have the second Pfizer.

                                                Started about 3am Saturday Morning March 6 with extreme pain between shoulder blades. Took 2 Advil and was able to go back to sleep. Woke in the morning feeling fine. Then started becoming ill early afternoon. Fever every day for 2 weeks. Nausea, vomiting, lose of appetite, extreme fatigue, headache, light sensitivity, rash, nagging slight cough and some nasal stuffiness mostly when talking (this might be because of the pollen) We were told it was an unidentified virus that would have to &#34;run its course&#34;. Even though we are vaccinated, we continue to quarantine because we provide child care for my grandson. There was virtually no circumstance where I would have been exposed to a virus. Also, my husband had to care for me because I could do almost nothing for myself and he did not contract the virus.

                                                On  March 19 around 8 pm my lymph nodes under my arm started swelling and were very painful. They stayed like that for for 3 days before starting to go down.. The injection hurt when it was given. The  first dose given in my left arm did not hurt 2/22/202. My lymph nodes in my neck swelled a little, but never caused  pain.  I had a mammogram on 3/18 and a place on my left breast/ lymph node has shown that it  could be malignant , but I have to go for more tests to check it out. I have since read about this happening after the Covid 19  vaccine.  The nurses at hospital said to report things like this since the vaccine is still so new, to help know what is happening. So that?s why wam. Thank you!

Also pain in most other joints and muscle weakness.  The situation is ongoing, some days are slightly better some are worse.  Knees, shoulders and right hand are most afflicted.  Pain is non-stop.  Muscle weakness has grown worse.  Having an extremely difficult time filling this form.

A 65-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8757) at the age of 65-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 31Mar2021 at 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date and no vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously took aspirin and experienced allergy which was described as deadly. She never took medications since she found that out at 16-year-old. The patient received her first shot on 31Mar2021 at a pharmacy and mentioned that she was not sick at the time of vaccination, but she had a violent reaction to it. When she received it, she didn&#39;t feel anything. People said you will get a sore arm, but she got none of that. Then in the middle of the night on Friday (02Apr2021) probably around 3:00, she woke up with acute pain on the left side, it was rib pain, she thought she cracked her rib. On the same day, she also experienced difficulty breathing, and didn&#39;t sleep at all. On Saturday morning (03Apr2021), when she woke up, she had nausea, a headache, and extreme fatigue, but wondered if the extreme fatigue was because she did not sleep. The nausea and headache went away 8 hours later, on the same day. On Sunday (04Apr2021), she was coughing and coughed up blood. When she coughed, there was blood in the mucous. She mentioned that she still has acute pain, she could not get comfortable. Her sister passed away in January and she had a 5 pm train she was supposed to catch, she was responsible for the funeral. She was thinking that if she went to a hospital, they would keep her for 24 hours, she could maybe make it to the funeral but that was questionable. By Monday (05Apr2021), the acute pain was gone, she still had a cough, there was still blood in the mucous, she has occasionally blood in the mucous. The cough has not gone away but she was getting better every day. The difficulty breathing continued until about 08Apr2021 (as reported), but she still has some shortness of breath, but nowhere near as bad. She consulted her notes and said she was at 30% on 03Apr2021 and she felt today that she was at 80% and every day she was a little better and better. She has to sleep upright, she was afraid to sleep flat, she slept in her chair, last night for 2 nights she slept upright in her bed. She probably could lay down, but she was more comfortable upright. Because she was sleeping upright, she was not fatigued, she was not sleeping well but she didn&#39;t think that has anything to do with what was going on. The events did not result in emergency room or physician office visit. She is supposed to get her second dose on 21Apr2021but she did not want to get the second shot. She asked if she could wait and get the one shot from Johnson &amp; Johnson. She didn&#39;t know where to go anymore. The outcome of the event &#34;acute pain on the left side, she thought she cracked her rib/ rib pain&#34; was recovered on 05Apr2021, recovered on 03Apr2021 for &#34;nausea&#34; and &#34;headache&#34;, recovered on Apr2021 for &#34;extreme fatigue&#34;, not recovered for &#34;didn&#39;t sleep at all&#34;, and recovering for all other events.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26Feb2021 12:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), at the age of 65-years-old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to Sulfa. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medication included calcium; magnesium; colecalciferol, menadione (VITAMIN K&#43;D); glutathione; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Within 45 mins (also reported as 20-25 minutes) of receiving the shot, she began to feel her left cheek tingle. In the intervening days, her left forehead, cheek, side of lip and chin felt like she had razor burn. Her head itched. Her left eye felt dry, but that went away. She began to salivate more than usual from the left side of her mouth. The left side of her face began to feel heavy, sometimes also my sinuses, but more often my lower jaw. Sometimes, she would feel pain in her left ear. Her lymph nodes on the left side of my face became swollen. Her doctor on Zoom said it sounded like a form of Bell&#39;s Palsy (medically significant), though she does not have the drooping eye or mouth. She had an MRI of her left lymph node that did not reveal any issues. Her symptoms, while they have abated, are still present five weeks after the shot. The events started on 26Feb2021 13:30. No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the event left eye felt dry was recovered while other events was not recovered.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Mar2021 09:40 (Lot Number: EN6199) (at the age of 65 years old) as single dose (dose 1) for COVID-19 immunisation; and methylprednisolone (MEDROL), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at short term increase of the Medrol dose (as reported), from  unspecified date to an unspecified date at 2 mg (for four years, as reported), then from unspecified date to 10Mar2021 at 6 mg, then from 11Mar2021 to 13Mar2021 at 8 mg, then from 14Mar2021 to unspecified date at 6 mg, for Lupus. Medical history included diagnosed with asthma initially exercised induced and now it is seasonal and was diagnosed years ago (states she has not had to use her Albuterol inhaler that much now because it is seasonal but she is doing more outside and is allergic to outside things so she tends to use the inhaler more if needed), right leg paresthesia (she did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine), autoimmune disorder, thyroid disorder and patient stated that she has lost height. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for asthma; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for thyroid disorder; paracetamol (TYLENOL); and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The patient had a history of Lupus and is on maintenance Medrol 2mg for four years and before that she had a short-term increase of the Medrol dose with flares of her Lupus. She had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 1st dose and then three days later on 10Mar2021 at 16:00, she thought what is going on and had her tongue tip so irritated and a strange feeling that it was a tiny bit edematous, her lower lip was full tingling. She had mucoid eruption on her lower lip and saw then that the next day thought it was swollen but it wasn&#39;t swollen. She had eruption on her tongue, had a rash to her face, neck, chest, back, shoulders and thighs. The rash was dispersed and there is a red raised rash with Lupus called Livedo reticularis and that is usually on the thighs but this rash on her was below her thighs and came up and dispersed between all the same rash elsewhere on her body. The healthcare professionals were closed so she took increased Medrol steroids and her Albuterol inhaler and Benadryl; the Benadryl was thrown out and discarded so she has no lot number to provide for it, stated that the Benadryl was the pediatric dye free bubblegum free. The Albuterol Sulfate HFA inhaler is 90mcg per puff and she does two puffs every 6 hours as needed; she had not taken the inhaler but she has trouble with asthma and took the Albuterol inhaler now as preventative and needs to use the inhaler as of yesterday (lot Y23B with expiry date Dec2021). Patient stated that she has the tools of her Albuterol inhaler, the steroid Medrol and the Benadryl and the knowledge so she prevented the symptoms she was reporting from being life threatening but stated the reported events were a little disabling and medically significant.She had joint pain in her left arm and could not use her left arm and her whole entire arm and hand. She had left clavicle pain under the clavicle and knows this did occur in the random trials but for her it went away after two days and is now back regarding the pain. She has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red. The next morning on 11Mar2021, her upper lip was tingling and she did go see her healthcare professional in town and sent photos to her Rheumatologist. As time went on she had tingling in her hands and her entire body from her scalp to her soles was so irritated and prickly and her soles and palms were bright red; it looked like Kawasaki disease and she used to take care of children with Kawasaki disease. On Saturday which was the 3rd day she was on the Medrol 8mg and had the fight or flight cardiac symptom and she cut herself down on the Medrol on the next Sunday to 6mg which seemed to make her better. The redness was gone until she had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 2nd dose yesterday and the healthcare professional initially said after her 1st dose of the vaccine to wait and see her rheumatologist do decided to do the increased Medrol dose of steroids and she stated she has got to get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; the healthcare professional checked her lungs that were clear and her pulse ox was fine and she was not wheezing and she then went on increased steroids from Medrol 6mg to 8mg right away. She did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine so she knows what it is like because she has issues with her spine but had not had the paresthesia in a long time. She increased to Medrol 8mg for the three days after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and got a flight or fight response. She had to increase the Medrol dose from 6mg and popped it up to 8mg and she had mucoid eruptions in her mouth, on her palate and down her throat and had a voice change. She has a laryngoscopy on Thursday (25Mar2021) with her ENT. She has pediatric doses of everything because she reacts to almost everything. The 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine was administered to her on 29Mar2021 09:45 with lot ER8732. Patient stated that anyone else would have gone to the emergency room but she took care of herself at home and knows the risk factors related to the vaccine. She absolutely felt the reported events were related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine in terms of causality and she never had these issues before. The rheumatologist had experience with patients with autoimmune diseases and stated people with autoimmune disease have a heightened immune reaction to the vaccine no matter which vaccine they get and are overly active and then a vaccine is thrown in there and we are charting new territory. The next Thursday or Friday over a week now after the Pfizer COVID Vaccine she had a multisystem type of thing and on 18th and 19th of March she started having episodes and was not doing anything but quietly doing something and had chest flutters and spontaneous cough where her heart races and felt she couldn&#39;t catch her breath and is now on a 30 day event monitor. She was not sure this is due to the Medrol steroids or the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She got her thyroid TSH level done because sometimes when the Synthroid dose needs to be lowered because it is too high for your body and you can have atrial flutter which she has had before in the past from her Synthroid dose being too high; states her Synthroid is 50mcg and takes it once per day by mouth and it is in a prescription bottle with no lot, expiry date or NDC. Patient saw her primary care physician again last Tuesday on 23Mar2021 and all the issues in her throat and neck area had something pressing around her throat and thought it was lymph nodes and woke up with a voice change and physician said he would take a look and he said it was not thrush and she would have to be scoped because he couldn&#39;t see in her throat. She had a referral for a CBC and Chemistry lab to be done on 25Mar2021 and TSH was in the usual range for her, the results from Thursday (25Mar2021) night had her BUN and creatinine and GSR (Glomerular filtration rate) abnormal. The rheumatologist called her that night and talked to the physician and said he considered this may be body inflammatory response to being vaccinated and could be that her kidneys were inflamed and she does not know as this is all new territory. For the kidney issues, the information was sent off to the rheumatologist who did orders and called the physician back the next day and she told him she thought she needed a nephrology consult and had urine chemistry, a urinalysis and looked for protein and did a blood draw for a chemistry screen with the following results on 25Mar2021: BUN 22.3, grade IIIa kidney failure, creatinine 1.28, eGSR-NAA 42ml/min, normal is over 60 and she usually runs 70 something. She went to the hospital over the years to have her chemistry lab done because she has Lupus and over the last two years she has never been below 60 for the eGSR-NAA. On 26Mar2021, she repeated the blood work and sent everything to her physician and the CMP had her BUN still elevated at 19.5, the creatinine was down to 0.97 and the eGSR-NAA was up to 58mL/min which is still abnormal; the urinalysis was all fine with no white cells and no leukocytes and no protein; the urine chemistry had the creatine of 8.5, the protein in the urine LVL was less than 0.4mg. Her CBC had her lymphs and monos down and she would expect having this response to the vaccine. Both physician called her on the weekend and they were concerned this came out of nowhere and now are monitoring her again in a month; her physician and rheumatologist both were entertaining this could be related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She does not take vaccines because of what they do to the body and did take the flu vaccine in Oct2020. She was covid negative (unspecified date) and stated had to be screened on Friday 26Mar2021 before her laryngoscopy and did the PCR test and only does the PCR. States she was doing research and had conflicting information from her physician and rheumatologist who she first saw her physician, after her 1st dose of the vaccine and the rheumatologist talked about increasing her steroids and she told him she was so tired and how with increased steroids, do steroids impact the effectiveness of the covid vaccine being blunt immune suppressants. Physician said long term chronic steroids have no effect on the effectiveness of the vaccine. She has no had headaches, shaky chills like everybody else has because she is on immune suppressants and has an article that says some evidence for steroids diminishing efficacy in Pfizer COVID Vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional Vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Events required a visit to physician office (No visit to the ER but did see her physician). The last action taken in response to the events for methylprednisolone was unknown. The outcome of the event had left clavicle pain under the clavicle was recovered on 12Mar2021; event has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red was recovered in Mar2021; outcome for the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events are assessed as possibly related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 based on strong temporal association, but possible contributory effects from patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications cannot be completely ruled out.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

On 19Mar2021, the patient had severe muscle pain on her calf of leg to inner thigh and it was throbbing so bad behind her knee on her left leg that she called her physician, and a sonogram was performed on 23Mar2021 which had found there was not a blood clot but there was severe inflammation along the major vein in her leg. On 20Mar2021, the patient had heart palpitation, her doctor told her to drink water and propel, she had heart spasms for 6 hours and felt lightheaded and dizzy. she thought she would go to the hospital, but she lives in a rural community and felt it did not make sense to go to the hospital. Palpitations and tenderness recovering. Her doctor and she was put on a heart monitor for her heart palpitations. She had heart palpitations with her hypothyroid but, this was totally different when she has had heart palpitations in the past. On an unknown date in Apr2021, the patient had diarrhea for 6 days. Patient had not been back to the doctor, but the nurse thought it was ok for her to take the second vaccine, but the patient was not comfortable with it. No prior vaccinations within the week.

Heart palpitation: Caller clarified that the heart murmurs she referred to earlier was actually heart palpitations. Caller stated this started at 8 in the morning and then at 10 in the morning she started getting light-headed and thought about going to the emergency room and figured no she will get through this. Caller stated she called her physician for the heart palpitations on Monday and she saw her doctor the following Tuesday and that is when her doctor had given her the heart monitor. Caller stated for 6 hours she felt horrible on Saturday since she knows the difference from her normal heart palpitations from her thyroid.

A 65-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Deltoid Left on 29Mar2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8727) as First Dose; Left Deltoid for covid-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type was in pharmacy. No vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. None prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Family medical history relevant to AE was none. Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol diagnosed about 30 years ago (it was hereditary), ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis diagnosed about 20 years ago. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin taken for blood cholesterol from about 3 years ago in 2018 to Apr2021 (a few weeks after the first dose of the vaccine); levothyroxine sodium (UNITHROID) taken for Hashimotos thyroiditis and ongoing. Patient was not on any other cholesterol medication currently. About 2 weeks after the first vaccine she started having leg pain. It was whole leg pain. It hurt in her thighs, knees, calves, and down into her ankles. She went to her doctor who did doppler studies and found no blood clots in Apr2021. Thought maybe it was the cholesterol medications that she had been on for years; so she stopped taking it. The pain in legs subsided a few days later and ended a few days before she got the second vaccine. She was a hiker and was in amazing shape. She had not done anything different, nothing that would have exacerbated this. She believed her symptoms are medically significant as she did not know for sure what was causing them. She was uncertain if her symptoms have been caused by the Covid Vaccine. The event whole leg pain after first dose of Covid Vaccine required a visit to physician office. No emergency room visited. She had issues with her back.  She noticed something new. Her lower back was sometimes sore. It came and went intermittently; unlike the leg pain that was constant. The back pain fluctuates from a pressure and mild ache to soreness. This also occurred after both vaccines. The outcome of back pain was not recovered, of other event was recovered in Apr2021. The reporter (patient) was uncertain if her symptoms have been caused by the Covid Vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available,The casual association between the reported event &#34;Pain in extremity&#34;,&#34;Back pain&#34; and suspected vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded.

                                                Muscle pain started with heaviness and stiffness around the injection site in left arm in the evening of being injected.  By day two muscle pain had spread to the top of the deltoid and around shoulder joint. Through the sixth day it centralized in two knots at the topmost trapezius/supraspinatus and semispinalis capitis. The worst was day seven when the pain began to extend up and down the left side of the spine. On days eight and nine, the pain left the spine and started migrating back toward the shoulder and the knots of pain diminished. By the tenth day (today) it has localized again in the deltoid/shoulder joint and injection location. Note: No fever at any time. It appears I am recovering.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Cholesterol and Blood pressure, patient stated she took low dose medication for her blood cholesterol and blood pressure, but has had no new medications. She had a history of some allergies: a slight shrimp and scallops allergy, possible peanuts, penicillin, and a Neomycin product. She said they were not a big deal, and she had environmental allergies as well. She had an allergic reaction to the eye drop Neomycin, possibly, just the eye drop, she had a little breakout around her lips but she didn&#39;t know if it was the drug or not. The allergy to shrimp and scallops showed up in a blood test, her reaction to peanuts around her mouth but she had a negative scratch test and blood test for allergy to peanuts. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient stated she did get the flu vaccine, that was ok, she was fine, this was probably around Nov2020 or so, though she didn&#39;t know off hand when she got it, it was the regular flu vaccine and not an increased dose. The patient experienced arm discomfort on 17Jan2021, itching to eyes, mouth, and throat an hour after vaccination on 17Jan2021 12:00. The patient took the first shot yesterday (17Jan2021) and she had some discomfort to her arm, but it didn&#39;t bother her. She got the shot about 11:00 yesterday (17Jan2021) and about an hour after the shot she had some itching to her eyes, mouth, and throat that was not severe then was on and off through the day. She would like to know if this is common, she would like the information for the second dose, if she should expect more or less or same, she was concerned about the second dose. She did not have a severe reaction, she just wanted to make sure there weren&#39;t any adverse reaction for that make sure she known. She had not seen a doctor for her itching eyes, mouth, and throat. She didn&#39;t do any treatment for it, it was better today (18Jan2021), she just noticed it an hour after the injection that she felt a bit of eyes being itchy and all over, her mouth and throat were not severe, but she definitely felt it through the day. She felt it a little at night sometimes anyway like a dry throat. It was gone this morning and her arm was better, it seemed like the itching went with the arm things since following her arm soreness her itchiness started, then when her arm felt better the itchy was going away. The outcome of events was recovering.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Message from patietn:  Due to other vaccine reactions I had to wait for 30 minutes after my shot.  All was okay, until I got in the car to drive home.  My tongue began to tingle and headaches began.  I immediately took an antihistamine as a tingly tongue for me is a sign of an allergic reaction.  I then had a band like pain across my upper back, and then the chills, tiredness, nausea, sore throat, sore arm which are all normal reactions from the printed information - well except for the tingly tongue and a red rash across my nose, cheeks and chin.  Tingling and rash subsided about an hour after taking the antihistamine, but all of the other symptoms remained.  My shot was at 1:50 PM and just before 11 PM I had instant onset of pain in my chest wall with breathing.  It went across the top of both breasts in the center where my ribs meet my sternum.  This has lessoned with laying down, but when I am up and about it increases although not as bad as last night.  I am also experiencing bursts of itchy spots all over.  As I have an EpiPen I did not  go to hospital but am wondering about what to do for the 2nd shot.  I think it will be best if I take an antihistamine prior to the shot and I will continue taking them for this one until my symptoms go away.

A 66-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249, expiry date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 11:37 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER9231, expiry date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced body aches, mostly in her arm and her knees are a little achy on 19Jan2021 22:00, chills on 19Jan2021, and kind of like the flu, like she was hit by a truck, had trouble getting off of the sofa, all on Jan2021. The patient just got her second Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She experienced nothing with the first dose. She had the second one yesterday 19Jan2021. Last night she had body aches and chills. The chills are completely gone and the body aches are 85%-90% better. She called out of work today, unknowing how long these would last, and her boss told her to get this reported. She does feel better. She was warned of the second dose being more ferocious. She felt great all day. Around 10 PM the body aches started. Kind of like the flu, like she was hit by a truck. She had trouble getting off of the sofa. They told her not to take Advil as it would make the vaccine not work as good. She is used to taking Advil. She confirmed she did not take the Advil. She took Tylenol instead, this morning. She had to go out and get some. The nurse told her when she got the second dose that she would have side effects and she would feel it. Her arm was sore so she circled it around. She went this morning to the pharmacy to get the Tylenol. She is unsure if because she was moving around, or because of the Tylenol that she feels so much better. Maybe like she could even go into work at Noon. She did not take Advil or Tylenol last night, which maybe that is why she was sore. The chills only lasted about half an hour last night and 15 minutes today. Body aches had greatly improved. It is mostly in her arm and her knees are a little achy. They are normally not. She is 85% better. It is going away as we speak. The outcome of the event Body aches, Pain in arm, knee pain was recovering, chills was recovered on 20Jan2021, while for the other events was unknown.

Yesterday (20Jan2021) she noticed, she had really bad arthritis like she has had a knee replacement and she has it her hands and yesterday she noticed her wrist was swollen and she didn&#39;t know if it could have been where she had arthritis or could it be side effect? She just didn&#39;t know if she should call her orthopedic doctor. She said the joint at the wrist, it was like the side of her hand, it was the side where your pinky was, just above the bone on her wrist it was swollen. It was swollen normally but it usually didn&#39;t hurt like this, it was like a burning but it maybe her arthritis acting up but she did not know.

She didn&#39;t think anything of the leg pain and it went away. The pain in her leg has resolved completely. The only other thing was her arthritis was really bad, it just seemed that it just flared up but she was wondering if it could be a side effect. The events didn&#39;t require a visit to emergency room or physician office.

I was laying on floor but don?t remember what happened except I must have twisted my ankle and knee as they are very sore.  I could not get up , no strength and hollered for Alexa to call my husband in the other part of the house.   I rested in bed and finally came  to couch and then around 3 ate a little but not hungry.  I feel better, took a bath and resting but have a terrible headache.

                                                After receiving the 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine on Sunday  morning, Feb. 14, my left underarm began to hurt in the evening.  I was tired that day but no other symptoms.  Through the night I had chills and sweats.  In the morning there was a large lump in my left underarm.  Swollen lymph glands about 3 inches wide and 2 inches deep.  This has continued through Monday and now Tuesday morning it is the same.  No sign of it growing larger or smaller.

                                                Two days after the injection I began to have deep pain in my left side axilliary lymph nodes. It felt like a stabbing pain in the front part of my underarm. Over a week the pain has continued at the same level and gradually continued to spread through my underarm area.  Today (with 10 days of reaction) I continue to have pain. Sometimes if feels like stinging.

                                                Beginning about 3 days following 2nd Covid-19 vaccination, experienced onset of nerve pain left side of neck, back left shoulder, radiating down left arm. Constant pain - much worse during sleep. Unable to sleep, changing positions little help - better sitting up or in high recline in bed. Treating with Tylenol, Ibupropfen periodically. Applying cold compress and warm compresses alternatively. Tried analgesic cream rub with little success. Able to exercise with little change. Rubbing of neck muscles helps somewhat.

                                                The morning after receiving the vaccine in my left arm, I woke up with more than moderate pain in my left hand when I tried to grip something, make a fist, or spread my fingers. I had no other symptoms besides a mildly sore arm - expected. Almost a week later, my arm is 100% (it was after a day or 2),  but I still have pain in my hand. Had no pain at the time of the injection - barely felt it, so I don&#39;t think the needle hit a nerve. Could the vaccine substance have irritated the nerve?  The pain seems to be focused on the center of my hand. If I press firmly on that spot, I can produce discomfort. My hand does not ache or hurt if it&#39;s at rest. The discomfort does not prevent me from carrying out the normal activities of life. Just thought I should report it. That said, happy for any thoughts about how to make it go away! Many thanks. Very grateful to be vaccinated.

It came and then it went away, then it came back again twice that day.  Each day it would come and go and would leave hives on her body. She took Benadryl and then started having ankle issues, and then a ball formed on the bottom of both feet, which lasted for several hours and went away. She went to the hospital yesterday 2/23/21 and broke out into hives again and then went to the hospital as her PCP did not have an opening. They told her that they had had some report of people breaking out with hives, and told her to not to get hot, keep the house on a cool temperature. He prescribed Prednisone and Pepcid and to continue with the Benadryl and suggested to not to take the 2nd shot. She called the help desk to see if it was okay to take the Prednisone and answered her questions and told her there was no indication that she could not take it. The symptoms still come and go with the hives and itching.

(Had  arm pain and mild chills and fatigue).  The day after dose two above noted fullness and discomfort in feet, On the second day after, had  early erythematous (non-puritic) rash, mild multi-joint discomfort, 100 deg fever, and shaking chills. Doctor on call said to use judgment on starting Prednisone, since hope that this would stabilize.  However, progressed and at 9am on the third day after vaccine started prednisone 40mg.  At the worst, had to be dressed by husband due to pain and stiffness in upper extremities, widespread erythematous rash, fullness of skin, joint swelling.

                                                About 2 hours after the 2nd dose vaccine, I began to have upper leg aches.  By 4 hours I was hurting very badly in both legs and had a very stiff neck and a headache.  I have arthritis all over my body.  I am not sure if the vaccine brought on the pain or if my arthritis caused the pain.  But, I have not had that much pain with my arthritis before the 2nd dose vaccine.  I was in so much pain I could not find a comfortable position in my bed to be able to go to sleep.  I was awake until dawn.  Finally,  the pain became less and I was able to fall asleep and sleep about three hours.  Today, 3-8-21, I feel fatigued and still have minor pain in my ankles.  Like I said I have never been in so much pain before.  The 1st dose vaccine only gave me a very sore arm.

I have had many vaccines in my life, including flu vaccine every year and never experienced such severe symptoms.

Around 7pm I started to develop chills which over a few hours I started to have shaking from the chills. I  also developed a headache, Temperature 101.1,  muscle weakness, pain at insertion site and diarrhea. I used Tylenol and Advil.  Around 0500 no longer experienced a temperature and chills had lessened.  Continued on day two to have slight chills and headache along with weakness.  Day 3 minimal weakness

A couple of days later, the pain continued over to my right side also and same difficulty getting a deep breath. For awhile, the pain was in my right armpit too. Put warm compresses on areas and it helped a bit. My sister looked up info on the internet and found that ?Aleve? might help the pain, which it did. Called the  doctor?s office and they were not very helpful. The information my sister got from the internet was of more help. The difficulty getting a deep breath lasted 2 weeks.

                                                Morning after 1st shot awoke with sore back and neck. Appeared swollen like inflammatory response to shot as day of shot felt fine. I did go to Physical Therapy that morning for knee but didn&#39;t do anything out of the ordinary since had been doing that for weeks.  That night was in so much pain couldn&#39;t get into bed. Pain  radiated from back to hip to thigh, and down shin, with no feeling in shin. Muscles very tight and was very odd. Seen by provider the next day and received Toradol shot. That did not provide relief so went to local ER. X-rays revealed pinched nerve. Now maybe that was because of the  inflammatory  response or pure dumb luck. Still in lot pain and will receive cortisone shot next week 10 days after 2nd dose today.  Providers feel not related, but one provider said if my back was inflamed even a simple reaching for glass in cupboard could pinch nerve. I was not going to report but then saw someone posted on (social media) had muscle pain and spasms which sounded like what I had. I believe my inflammatory response to shot drove me to the pinched nerve situation. Been in pain for weeks and had to go to 2nd shot in wheelchair.

I can&#39;t hold my hand down, it is very sensitive, I can&#39;t turn my head around or even tilt my head back to gargle my throat..  I have to hold my hand in a certain way because it hurts terribly.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after shot (during the night), I woke up with debilitating pain in multiple parts of my body: wrists; left groin and leg; neck/shoulders; lower back and had a headache.   All of these areas were thrubbing and interrupted sleep.  Also was very weak.   Was difficult to get out of bed or a chair and to walk. Also had loss of appetite.  At no time, did I have a temperature.(Note:  I play tennis so was very active early in the week). The course of the symptoms has lasted 96hours but now seems to be subsiding. After 48 hours of inability to do any normal life activities, I contacted my physician who prescribed a cordtisone shot and anti-inflamatory medication, which I&#39;ve taken for 2 days.

Throbbing stopped in big toe and then moved to right wrist, then stopped at wrist and went to left leg.  Throughout the next 24 hours their would be sharp pains in right ankle.  Left arm at injection sight very painful. Pains would occur in different body parts next 24 hours.  Extreme tiredness to the point of ongoing sleep well passed the 6 hours of regular sleep for me.  It took 4 days for me to start to feel I was returning to normal function,  the fifth day I felt normal.  I thought this was a long time to recover from shot in comparison to what I did hear.

                                                seizures; muscle fatigue; hives; rash from head to toe; sore muscles; wrap around headache; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable healthcare professional (patient herself). A 66 -year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. She provided a brief history from 2017. She was walking her dog and she fell and suffered a concussion, she had a seizure, then she developed bipolar disorder. She&#39;s been taking sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) for her seizures since 2017. She reports she&#39;s very active. She&#39;s not an old lady. She can run circles around some 22 year old&#39;s. In September of 2017, she had a concussion and had seizures. She&#39;s been on sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) since that time. She&#39;s not mentally ill, the concussion she got in 2017 caused her brain to turn bipolar. It&#39;s hard for people to understand that. Sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) was 500mg. She takes 1 tablet in the morning and 2 tablets at night because it can make you sleepy. She reports she was recently hospitalized in Feb2021 for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (RVR). Her heartrate was 181 beats per minute, her blood pressure was dropping, she tested positive for rhinovirus and the doctor thinks the atrial fibrillation with RVR was caused from the rhinovirus. She was allergic to bee venom and carries an EPI PEN. Medical history also included ongoing high blood pressure from an unspecified date (controlled with medication). Concomitant medications included ongoing metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR) taken for blood pressure; ongoing lisinopril; ongoing valproate semisodium (DEPAKOTE) taken for seizure from 2017; ongoing hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril (LISINOPRIL HCTZ) taken for blood pressure; paracetamol (TYLENOL) from an unspecified date in 2021. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9810; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021). The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions or any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported; or any other vaccines around the time of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The patient reported that with the second Covid 19 vaccine she had two seizures on 27Mar2021. The seizures were back to back. The seizures resolved within 2 minutes. She had fatigue from an unspecified date, sore muscles and a wrap around headache on 26Mar2021. The wrap around headache felt like she was going to have a stroke even though her blood pressure was fine. She monitored her blood pressure at her home. She feels it&#39;s weird that they publish that the second Covid 19 vaccine is going to be worse. She thought she&#39;d have muscle soreness and fatigue but not seizures. She looked it up and the wrap around headache and seizure are the rarest things that can happen after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She stayed in bed from Friday afternoon after she received the second Covid 19 vaccine on 26Mar2021 and started to feel better Sunday afternoon, 28Mar2021. Her blood pressure and pulse were both fine with her wrap around headache. She had fatigue with both Covid 19 vaccines. She also developed hives, which she still has. She has a rash from her head to her toes. It looked like she rolled around in an ant bed. The hives were clearing up. She was using an anti-itch cream. The hives and the rash started midday on Saturday, 27Mar2021. She only has around 5 hives now on her chest. She hasn&#39;t taken Benadryl. She doesn&#39;t like to take it. Her doctor didn&#39;t want her to open the hives and cause impetigo. She never had any soreness in her arm. She doesn&#39;t think the headache was serious because she had a blood pressure cuff at home. She just knew the hives and the rash were a reaction to the Covid 19 vaccine. She didn&#39;t go to the hospital for her seizures. She was not seen in the Emergency Department, hospitalized, or admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. She tries to do holistic medicines and treatments. She doesn&#39;t run to the hospital every time something happens. She tries to stay out of the hospital. She&#39;s fine now and she loves Pfizer. If she can get a medicine she needs that Pfizer makes she tries to get it. She tries to see every side of things. Outcome of seizures was recovered on 27Mar2021 and sore muscles was recovered on 28Mar2021; of remaining events was recovering.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and seizure cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and treprostinil sodium (TYVASO), via resp inhalation from Feb2021 to an unspecified date, at 18-54mug (3-9 breaths), 4x/day for secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension. Medical history included ongoing secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension, ongoing arthralgia, ongoing myalgia, seasonal allergy, and hypertension from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included sildenafil citrate taken for an unspecified indication; and amlodipine besilate taken for hypertension. The patient previously took meloxicam for joint pain. On an unspecified date in 2021, the patient experienced joint and muscle pain that are worse, rheumatoid arthritis and seasonal allergies. The patient had joint and muscle pain for a while, but was worse since starting treprostinil sodium. The event of rheumatoid arthritis was considered as medically significant. The patient had joint and muscle issues (arthralgia, myalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis) that could be debilitating, reported that they were getting better with the Nabumetone. On 29Mar2021, the patient had nasal stuffiness that started when she went on an outing. She felt like she was doing better this week than last week (at time of report). On 31Mar2021, the patient reported that she was having a reaction or allergies. She received her first COVID vaccine on 29Mar2021 and felt fine but woke up on Tuesday (30Mar2021) with stuffy head, nose began to run, and began to sneeze. The action taken in response to the events for treprostinil sodium was unknown. The outcome of the events arthralgia and myalgia was recovering, for rheumatoid arthritis was not recovered, and for other events was unknown.  The reporter&#39;s causality for the event of myalgia and arthralgia with IH Tyvaso was considered to be possibly related. The reporter did not provide causality for the events of rheumatoid arthritis and seasonal allergy.  Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse event of drug hypersensitivity and rheumatoid arthritis as not related to IH treprostinil and TD-300/A device. Drug hypersensitivity was likely due to administration of COVID vaccine. Rheumatoid arthritis was likely an underlying medical condition in this 66-year-old patient based on an implausible time to onset for the reported event.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

She wanted to report that she developed a blood clot in her right ankle. She went to the doctor yesterday on 06Apr2021. She would like to add she has no prior history of any type of blood issues. The doctor she saw thought that the blood clot and the Covid 19 vaccine could be related but would not commit to saying so directly. She started having issues about 6 days after the second Covid 19 vaccine. She doesn&#39;t exactly remember when, maybe the 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. She ignored the issues attributing them to over exercising. She reached a point where she couldn&#39;t ignore the issues anymore and went to the doctor. Caller clarifies she has a varicose vein in her right ankle and it started to hurt then her ankle on her right side started swelling. She only payed attention to her ankle when it got worse. The last 3 weeks have been awful. She would like it known that she does not lead a sedimentary lifestyle. She rides her bike 60 miles a week and walks 10 miles a week. She&#39;s always moving. This is unusual for her. The doctor she saw diagnosed her with a blood clot and he did a sonogram in his office. She has been prescribed Xarelto 15mg tablets. Take 2 tablets twice daily for the first 21 days then on the 22nd day start taking one 20mg tablet once daily. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sonogram: unknown result on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the all events was unknown.

The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm 17Feb2021 at 14:00 (65-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received the second dose of VARICELLA ZOSTER VACCINE RGE (CHO) (SHINGRIX) for shingles and felt like we were getting the flu and the next morning was fine. Patient states she had stem cells put in her hip and was (medical office name) for an x-ray to see how it&#39;s doing. She showed a nurse practitioner her hand and nurse practitioner said patient needs to report that. Patient states it swells right under her finger, swelling under her middle and ring finger. The joint went stiff and the pain. She can&#39;t bend her fingers, it is mostly her ring finger. She couldn&#39;t straighten it out or bend it all the way down, it was like it was locked. Following her second vaccine dose she has had pain in the center of the palms of her hands and bottom of her feet. The pain is inconsistent as it comes and goes. The feet pain come and go not bad like the hands. The middle of the palm pain comes and goes and the joint on 1 finger never did get better, it is worse at night and a teeny bit better in the morning. She felt pain in 1 of her feet for a moment yesterday and not continuous like her hand. The left hand is not swelling, the center of her palm has a weird feeling, states she has never had shingles before but imagines that is what the palm of her hand would feel like, it is an achy pain. States she kept telling her husband she has pain in the center of her hands and on the bottoms of her feet and feels like she is about to have a break out and didn&#39;t. Patient states it has been a month since she had the 2nd vaccine. States the symptoms all started within 24 hours of the 2nd vaccine. On 07Apr2021, nurse practitioner put a lubricant injection (name unknown) into her hand where the swelling was. Patient was told it was a lubricant that might help, and it has helped some. It is moving a little better today after the injection but she still has pain. Adverse events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event &#34;swells right under her finger&#34; and included lubricant injection. The outcome of swells right under her finger, joint stiffness, and joint lock was recovering; other events were not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 17Mar2021 at 11:30 AM (at the age of 66 years old) (Lot Number: EN6205, unknown expiration) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing anxiety (40 years or more), ongoing depression (46 years ago, at the age of 20), ongoing acid reflux (maybe 25 years), ongoing GERD (maybe 25 years), ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus (for 12 years), mild to moderate COPD since 2011, gastric bypass (a year and a half ago), and lost 120 pounds. Concomitant medications included bupropion for anxiety depression and omeprazole for acid reflux, both ongoing.  The patient previously received flu and tetanus on unspecified dates for immunization and both experienced hard red welt on arm (welt was hard and lasted for 5-7 days). The patient reported no side effects for 12 hours, but a little soreness at injection site on 17Mar2021 at 20:00 (8:00 PM). Her arm wasn&#39;t heavy, but she had an awareness of the soreness.  She has had life-long anxiety and depression. Several weeks ago (on 26Mar2021), her anxiety reared up, and it could have been due to a family situation. On the 9th day after the first shot, she was having a therapy appointment on the phone and talking about her anxiety, and she got a stiff neck, like an iron claw (26Mar2021 at 10:00 am). It lasted for a couple of 5 minutes and she laid down on the couch then on the floor.  Her therapist said to call 911. Emergency medical technicians came to her house and they said all of her numbers looked good.  She went to the hospital, and was in the emergency room for several hours, but she only remembers one hour of it.  She also had diarrhea and nausea on 26Mar2021 at 11:30, and it felt like Dumping Syndrome, that one can have from a gastric bypass. She was only aware for one hour at that point and blacked out (on 26Mar2021). With regards to nausea, she mostly saw bile in the bag, all she had that day was a protein drink. She was back home and the next day, she did not remember how she got home. She hasn&#39;t had blackouts anymore but feels it may be from heightened anxiety.  On 27Mar2021 at 09:00, she had no appetite, lost 6 pounds in a week, and was tired. She had headache lasted for days and days on 29Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. She is slowly improving but she still doesn&#39;t sleep through the night on 29Mar2021 at 16:00. It was like a feeling like she was resetting her surgery, like she didn&#39;t care about eating.  The also experienced back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica on 31Mar2021 at 16:00 and was constipated. She is using a stool softener and is back in her routine. She called her primary doctor and could not tell her what happened, and she went in a loop trying to get information and authorizations for her to make a determination of what had happened.  Her doctor felt like she should have an MRI. Her heart and all of her numbers looked good, as the emergency medical technicians said. Her primary doctor recommended her to get the second shot.  She had cancelled the second shot for this week, and she has rescheduled it for another date.  She was afraid that she will black out again, after the next vaccine, and is not sure if that is how her anxiety manifested. The main reasons she is calling is that she had no concerns of side effects prior to the vaccine, and a couple of her neighbors said they had read about side effects of the vaccine, but she was not worried.  When the patient started to read about side effects of the vaccine, she understood that on the 10th day, the vaccine starts to be in a person&#39;s system and that maybe is why she didn&#39;t have initial side effects, but then she had side effects several days later because the vaccine was in her body.  By day 10, the vaccine is in effect in the body and she is nervous. Her second vaccine is scheduled on 26Apr2021. The patient would like to know if there is any information on people that have had a gastric bypass. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The events resulted in emergency room visit (except nervous). The patient recovered from soreness at injection site on 18Mar2021; recovered from diarrhea, nausea,  felt like Dumping Syndrome on 26Mar2021; recovered from stiff neck on 26Mar2021 at 10:05am; recovered from constipation on 02Apr2021; and recovered from no appetite and lost 6 pounds on unspecified dates. The patient also recovered from headache with sequelae on unspecified date; and recovered from blacked out on 27Mar2021 with sequelae. The patient had not yet recovered from anxiety reared up; tired; doesn&#39;t sleep through the night; back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), subcutaneous in right deltoid of the upper arm, on 09Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included pain, use of medication to help with sleep, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and thyroid. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included levothyroxine for thyroid, pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (PROTONIX) for GERD, trazodone to help with sleep, zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN) to help with sleep, morphine (extended relief) for pain, and morphine sulfate (immediate relief) for pain. They also gave the patient diazepam (VALIUM) if she needs to take it but she did plan; she didn&#39;t take it. The patient just didn&#39;t take diazepam and then pain management doctor put her on morphine extended release. Then, morphine sulphate immediate relief, so she can take up to 4 for day and she was not using now. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered in a pharmacy. The patient would like to report a reaction that she received that she had approximately for an hour and a half, that basically started in an hour after the injection. The patient&#39;s first COVID-19 shot was given by Pfizer on 09Mar2021 and what happens in next hour was she became totally paralyzed from her neck down to her arm, legs, and everything. It was approximately about 30 minutes after the shot that she began to notice some weakness in extremities (also reported as eternities) and then they got home an hour later, and her husband left the patient then she got to know she could not move. The patient can breathe, and she was totally conscious, but she could not move, could not pull herself along the floor, could not pull from the sofa, could not move her knee, and could not move her body. So, the patient thought maybe she should report this. On an unspecified date, the patient had significant weight loss. The patient was eating but she was rapidly losing. The patient didn&#39;t have COVID-19; she had been tested negative, so she didn&#39;t have COVID-19. The patient was tested 4 times for her to be around her grandchildren and make sure everything is okay. The patient had been tested against COVID-19 because of her grandchildren. The patient tried to take them, and she just now received the paper it was negative. So, it was her third one to try to watch her grandchildren because they were infant, and all test results were negative. It was also reported that the patient had no other problem, just the pain clarified as chronic back pain since an unspecified date. The patient checked this as persistent for chronic back pain; it is positive, definitely it&#39;s totally osteolysis on an unspecified date. Treatment was received for all events (unspecified medications). The patient went to her primary healthcare doctor as a result of the events and he said it was no big deal and she told him that she disagrees with that. Trazodone was added to zolpidem tartrate to help w with the sleep because she had terrible pain in the back (right here) and her extremities after this incident (unspecified date). It was her first dose and she was afraid to get the second one now. The patient was supposed to get her second one last week and she didn&#39;t. So, they told her to come back in 3 weeks or 4 weeks. The patient underwent laboratory test back in December (unspecified year). The patient recovered from &#34;Paralyzed from her neck down to her arm, legs, and everything; weakness in extremities; could not move&#34; on 09Mar2021. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Chronic back pain; terrible pain in the back&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to event paralyzed from her neck down to her arm, legs, and everything cannot be excluded based on close temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Night 4 woke 2 am with more intense discomfort left knee, again not like anything experienced before but did not require Tylenol. It was gnawing and annoying, Night 5 woke around 4 am with left lower leg/ side of foot mild ache which lasted a few hours. Stretching, changing positions had no effect on any of three nights.  Day after vaccine while exercising I perspired more than usual and was tired. Did not concern me in any way and would not have reported unless had above symptoms.  Question- Do any of the above symptoms indicate I should not get dose 2?  Thank you

                                                3 days following vaccine, experienced tenderness and discoloration in left hand. With it was tenderness in my hand and wrist, by the 3rd day, I woke with throbbing pain in my knuckle joint with swelling and redness. Since then, the swelling and pain has progressed to additional knuckles in my left hand and into my right hand. There has also been joint pain in my left shoulder that resolved. Yesterday my right knee began to hurt. I&#39;ve used ice packs and alternated between  ibuprofen and acetaminophen for the pain. The swelling has somewhat improved but has not resolved. The pain is still present. I&#39;ve had occasional join pain before but nothing like this and it has always  resolved. Not sure if this has anything  to do with the vaccine, but since joint pain was listed as a side effect, I thought I should report it. Have not contacted my physician yet.

                                                On Christmas day I was working and then you started feeling like a pinching in my chest, like when you are going to catch a cold, that went on through the afternoon. In the afternoon I started with light headache and dry cough (intermittent), no temperature. I did not take anything for it and continued working. When I got home, I felt weak and was supposed to join my family for Christmas and decided not to go. And went to sleep. The next day (Sat) I was still not feeling well, weakness on my limbs, I went to the hospital to see if I could get checked and they told me to return on Monday because Occupational Health was closed on the weekends. I went home and treated myself with Tylenol and Vitamin C. On Monday I got tested and was positive. By then, I was coughing, limbs weak, had temperature (101F).  I started to get weaker an weaker and Tuesday or Wednesday my work called me and asked me if I would like to come see a doctor. Wednesday I started with shortness of breath. I called my PCP and he prescribed me an albuterol inhaler. It helped me but my cough got worse by Saturday. My doctor then told me to go to the hospital (I live by myself).  At my choice I went to Medical Center and were admitted and was hospitalized for 6 days.  They kept treating me with inhaler and oxygen. They wanted to send me to rehab but I told them I wanted to go home. I came home with oxygen and with albuterol inhaler and the ambulance had to bring me home. I still was feeling very weak, had cough, and had the shortness of breath. And I have been home since then. I have home health and a therapist that come check on me 2X a weekly.

                                                Yesterday I received my 2nd Pfizer vaccine at 9AM. My first dose was a non-event. About 50 minutes after the jab, I broke out in hives on my upper thigh and stomach. By 7 PM, I felt really sick, my arm felt as though the strongest person in the world punched me, and by 8, I was shivering and wrapped in a ton of  blankets, by 10, every muscle in my body ached beyond its capacity and my fever was 101.8.  It got to 102.1. My head was weighed down with an unrelenting headache. Finally, an hour ago, my fever broke. I have Systemic Lupus and CRPS and do not vaccinate because my body is always attacking itself. But this year I got my first ever flu vaccine. Same results. So sick.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                The day after receiving the vaccine (Wednesday 3/3/21) I noticed extreme sensitivity to sunshine while driving, even while wearing shades.  Remind me of when I get my pupils dilated by the ophthalmologist.  Also muscle pain, chills, and fatigue.  All these symptoms disappeared by the next day, but the fatigue remained through the weekend. Today, 3/8/21 I feel back to normal. I had Covid 19 in May 2020, so I recognize some of the symptoms, except for the light sensitivity, which scared me.  I will consult with my ophthalmologist before my second dose scheduled for 3/23/21.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

Four days later the pharmacist contacted me telling me I had only received a saline solution and would need to get vaccinated again. I inquired how they knew this and received sparse information saying they couldn&#39;t tell me ... privacy etc.  Then on March 10th I went to another one of their locations and received the first vaccine of Moderna ... I have been super sick since then.. I have had fever, delirium, cognitive impairment ( forget vocabulary MID sentence) severe covid arm, ( worse than the images on line) pain in my left hand, stiffness in my left fingers ( what I assume arthritis might be like)   I WANT TO KNOW what WAS IN THE FIRST PFIZER INJECTION:  I AM DEMANDING... to find out what was in the first shot, why it was reported to me 4 days later, How the facility knew it was only saline... WAS it TRULY ONLY SALINE or have I been injected with two different doses of vaccines within a 9 day period?  I really need to know what it going on.

Tingling in thumb and 3 fingers. Never have had any issues like this. Went to Orthopedic doctor who found arthritis in neck. Given Prednesone but did not help at all. Called doctor again and asked if tingling in hands was associated with arthritis and told not normally and what else I could do?  Suggested an MRI which did not have yet.

Concomitant medications included estradiol (IMVEXXY) taken for vulvovaginal dryness; vitamin C [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D); calcium. On Monday, 22Feb2021, the patient felt draggy, but did not think it was a big deal. She just thought it was from the shot and was feeling tired. The draggy feeling lasted a few days, but she was unable to clarify outcome further. On Tuesday, she started to feel achy and felt like that too was to be expected. The achiness went away on 25Feb2021. On Wednesday, 24Feb2021, she was really busy. She was still achy but was busy. She also did not drink much water for several hours. It dawned on her later when she was not feeling good. Late Wednesday afternoon it was like everything cratered and she felt horrible. She was feeling bad. She was freezing and had chills. It was a horrible feeling. She helps with her grandkids since she is retired. They were home from school and had to sit on the couch. She felt cold, yucky, and achy. It was a yucky feeling. She went home a couple of hours later. She told her husband she had to lie down on the couch because she felt horrible. She could not further describe horrible feeling. Her daughter had called her as well and was unable to describe how she felt to her daughter. She could only say she felt so sick but could not explain further. She felt awful and could not put her finger on it. She was laying down and when she got up, she felt like she would pass out. At that time, she had not eaten dinner yet. She ate dinner, took one bite and the food came back up. For a few moments she felt so faint, she felt shortness of breath, but it was only for a few seconds. After that, her and her and her husband took a drive to go to hospital. However, by the time she got to hospital she was feeling better. She was also talking to a friend at that time who said all of this was probably form the shot as well. Since she was feeling better decided not to go into the hospital and went back home. At the time she was thinking this was all from the shot and no big deal. On Wednesday night, things got crazy and worse. That evening Wednesday she was getting ready for bed and noticed her cheeks were flushed. On Thursday she got up and noticed rash. She was covered all over her body. It did not itchy really, but it was a rash. Not a bumpy rash, it reminds her of Roseola. Her joints and fingers were starting to swell. Her hands were swollen. It started with her knuckles, it went to her fingers, up to her hands, wrist. Her wrist was sore. Her joint swelling was worse. On Friday, she tried to see her doctor, but could not be seen by the doctor. However, she got in with the PA. When she saw the doctor, it could be seen her hands were swollen. However, the main reason she went to the doctor was due to the rash. However, her joints were sore and swollen.

Back pain near kidney developed a week after vaccine. 4.  Thirsty and for 3 days unquenchable thirst. 5.  Had spurts of joint pain all over for several days. Did not have these symptoms with 1st vaccine, this has been progressing for 2 weeks, as of tomorrow, and got worse as time passed. I am very active and healthy and this has certainly impacted my routine.  I still work. Visit to Dr. about back pain resulted in negative test and Dr. blamed it on vaccine.

                                                About 9 1/2 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to experience flu-like symptoms : Full body aches, chills and a headache.  Also my armpits felt swollen and hurt a great deal. The symptoms lasted about 30 hours. By 7 am on the second day after the shot I felt fine however, both of my armpits are still hurting. I am assuming it is from swollen lymph nodes.   (After the first shot I went for my annual mammogram and one lymph node in my left arm was still swollen.)

Went to the emergency room that morning.  Seen by nurse practitioner and diagnosed with Inflammation of the lymph nodes.  Could not confirm it was related to the vaccine.

That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

                                                A few hours after the shot, I experienced a mild bout of diarrhea.   Then began to run a fever.  The injection site and right arm became extremely heavy and painful.  Overnight, I experienced fever, extreme muscle cramping and a burning sensation in all of my joints.  Took a Tylenol at midnight which helped.  Fever remained at 99.8 which is high for me.  This lasted for the next 24 hours.  Today, Friday the 26th, I am finally feeling better and fever is gone.

She commented that she was not in good shape when she took the vaccine to begin with. She is immunosuppressed and thinks that she should not have received the vaccination. But she also stated that she took the vaccine because she is a severe asthmatic and does not have a strong immune system so if she got COVID, she would die. Concomitant medication included benazepril (BENAZEPRIL) for blood pressure abnormal from an unspecified start date and ongoing; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) for arrhythmia from 2014 and ongoing; rifaximin (XIFAXAN) for hepatic encephalopathy from 2014 and ongoing; lactulose (LACTULOSE)for hepatic failure, ammonia abnormal from 2014 and ongoing; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for autoimmune thyroiditis from 1984 and ongoing; omeprazole (PRILOSEC [OMEPRAZOLE]) for reflux gastritis, chronic gastritis from an unspecified start date and ongoing; alprazolam (XANAX) for anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder from 2009 and ongoing; albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL [SALBUTAMOL]) for asthma from an unspecified start date and ongoing; ranitidine (RANITIDINE) for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.The patient previously took flu vaccine vii, olysio for hepatitis c and experienced histamine level increased, lyrica and experienced weight increased.

Lab tests and procedures included cardiac output: over 50 percent, echocardiogram: her heart was good and clear, electroencephalogram with unknown results, magnetic resonance imaging with unknown results, all on unknown dates. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pretty severe headache; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between generalized aching, severe headache, feel dizzy, going to faint, vision blurred, no energy  been very tired, very cold, her skin was very cold, wheezing and bnt162b2 vaccine cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association. The Company considers the reported event fibromyalgia flare up is unrelated to bnt162b2 vaccine but more likely due to underlying medical history of ongoing fibromyalgia.

                                                Within an hour of the shot I  felt very tired and took a long nap. Around 5 pm I began to feel a little achy and a slight headache. During the night, I ached all over, had a terrible headache, the muscles in my neck felt like they were drawing  up, I had fever, but didn&#39;t get up to check it, my joints and bones ached, I had chills and it was a miserable night. The next morning I got up to make my breakfast and I kept trying to pass out and would have to sit down. I was sweating real bad and finally went to lay down. My husband fixed my lunch and I began to feel like my eyes were getting black, and then I slumped over and he said my head was bobbing on his shoulder. I could hear him saying my name, but I couldn&#39;t respond. Right after I cam to, I began to throw up at the table. He called an ambulance and they came and check me out. My blood pressure, blood sugar, EKG, and pulse ox were all normal. I refused going to the hospital, but I didn&#39;t know what the hospital could do for me. I called my family physician&#39;s office, but never heard back from them. I hear the second shot is worse than the first, so I am not sure if I should take the second shot. Also, strangely enough, my arm wasn&#39;t sore. Every time I have the flu shot I feel bad for a couple of days. I also felt bad after my Shringrix shot and pneumonia shots.

The patient previously had first dose of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication includes supplements and multivitamins. The patient stated &#34;I wanted to ask you and I have some horrible concerns I got my second COVID shot last Friday, and by Saturday night, I am not exaggerating, my symptoms were so severe I felt like I was going to die I mean literally die on 20Mar2021. I couldn&#39;t get to emergency room, I figured out I am just going to die, I just laid down and let my door open down so somebody could find me, the symptoms I was having was extreme nausea, chills, headache, the chest pain was horrible, horrible, the headache I mean I thought I am going to have a stroke, the joint and muscle pain were so severe. So I have been taking Tylenol, Advil (Treatment) finally this morning, yesterday was tiny, tiny bit better, this morning its little bit better but I am still little real nauseous and I feel like I mean like acid coming up constantly making me more nauseous and almost like unable to eat. Ever since Saturday all I will have been doing is three bites of chicken soup three times a day. What in the world is going on with this vaccine that it would cause those severe symptoms and my chest is still tight I still feel low congestion having hard time taking a deep breath in Mar2021&#34;. The outcome of the event &#34;my symptoms were so severe I felt like I was going to die I mean literally die&#34; was recovered on unspecified date. The outcome of the event unable to eat was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was recovering.  Information on lot/ batch number has been requested.

A 67-year-old non-pregnant female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL9266, Expiration date: Unknown) on 09Feb2021 at 24:00 via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 Immunization in the hospital. The patient&#39;s medical condition included Breast cancer from 2020, NDPH (New daily persistent headache) since 1973 and Food intolerances not anaphylactic reactions: Gluten, peppermint from an unknown date and unknown from ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously had first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL9261, Expiration date: Unknown) on 19Jan2021 at 11:30 via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 Immunization. The patient had not used any other vaccine in four weeks and not in two weeks. On 10Feb2021 18:00 the patient had sudden low back pain and stiffness beginning about 36 hours following 2nd vaccination. (The first 36 hours, I felt great-seemed to have extra energy. No injection site pain.) Pain and stiffness made it difficult to get comfortable, and it was very difficult to stand up or move around. I was bedridden for about 24 hours. Today is day 5 after vaccination, and I still have some pain/stiffness albeit much less severe. The patient had not tested for COVID-19 prior to vaccination and post vaccination. The patient did not receive treatment medication. The outcome of the event was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                also had a headache; her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes; her platelet levels dropped; having muscle pain or some kind of pain, maybe joint pain that is in her hips; has had nausea and she has generally felt unwell; muscle pain; she slept for almost two days; felt unwell; diarrhea; abdominal pain; her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes; her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes; tiredness; eyes were yellow when she woke up that morning; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6200), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Mar2021 11:45, single dose as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lung transplant from May2011, immunodeficiency from May2011 and ongoing, strokes. The patient had dtap vaccine before Jan2021. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); prednisone acetate (PREDNISONE); tacrolimus monohydrate (TACROLIMUS). Patient reported that it has been about a week and a half of maybe more since her first COVID vaccine and she gets new symptoms almost everyday. Most of the symptoms aren&#39;t like put-you-down sick, horrible symptoms, they can be dealt with, but she has had a lot of them. She never got injection site pain and her arm never got sore. She had tiredness on the second day after her COVID vaccine, she slept for almost two days. She has a headache almost constantly. She is having muscle pain or some kind of pain, maybe joint pain that is in her hips. She doesn&#39;t have chills, a fever, injection site swelling or redness. She has had nausea and she has generally felt unwell all the time for a week and a half now. She is immunocompromised because she has had a lung transplant, that is the one thing that probably sets her apart is that she is immunosuppressed. She had the lung transplant almost 10 years ago now and she has been doing well. She is not on blood thinner medicine but she does take a baby aspirin everyday. Those are the only two things that she can think about. She doesn&#39;t know if all of that would make the symptoms from the COVID vaccine different for her. Most people she knows who have received the COVID vaccine have only had a couple days of tiredness and a sore arm. But she has a headache, been achy, and she just doesn&#39;t feel good. She also had a headache then and slept a lot, she was really tired. Later in the report caller clarified the first dose was actually 09Mar2021. She is not tired right now but she does still have a headache today, it is a pretty good headache. Her tiredness was Sunday and Monday of this week, confirmed to be 14Mar2021 and 15Mar2021. She says that she has recovered completely from the tiredness even though she feels like she could nap right now but she can&#39;t since she has a blood draw later. It is like she wakes up and every day she gets new symptoms. She had two symptoms that are not on the sheet of symptoms. The two she experienced are weird. On Saturday, a week and a day after her vaccine, her eyes were yellow when she woke up that morning. Confirmed date to be 13Mar2021. It was only that one day. She thinks that she has recovered completely. Also, her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes. Some of this is normal in the winter for her, but the yellow isn&#39;t normal for her. Normally, when she does get the blood vessels in her eyes they will heal in a day or so but the ones now have lasted much longer. They have been much slower to go away. It is not like there is a red spot, but it looks kind of red and kind of weird. The other symptom that is strange is that her platelet levels dropped. She was at 49 before her COVID vaccine and now her platelet level is down to 29. She does have normally very low levels for platelets but they are usually around 50. They have dropped substantially since her COVID vaccine. They dropped from 50 to 33 and then 5 days later her level went to 29. She is getting another platelet level drawn today, confirmed to be 16Mar2021. Her eyes being sore, red, and having broken blood vessels occurred probably a couple of days after she received the COVID vaccine. Specifically, her left eye felt like it had something in but she doesn&#39;t believe that it did. She used eye drops. Her eye just felt gritty. This is not like she had pink eye and she didn&#39;t wake up with this eye shut. It wasn&#39;t pink eye she knows what that is like. Her eyes had broken blood vessels and then they turned yellow then they turned red and have remained red. They are not sore today and she doesn&#39;t feel like she has gravel in her eye but the whites of her eyes don&#39;t really look clear. She says so far it has improved some but she will see since she wakes up every day and something new has happened, or something different or something has come back again. The good news is that she doesn&#39;t have all of these symptoms at the same time. She can&#39;t the remember the day pain in hips began but it is ongoing. She noticed this morning that the pain in her hip was not as bad when she had gotten out of bed. That pain has lessened there but the pain went to her head. Nausea and generally not feeling well: Probed for when this began and caller says that it has occurred for several days after she eats dinner, her stomach will be growling loud and that comes along with abdominal pain which doesn&#39;t really fit in with muscle or joint pain, she has no muscle there unfortunately she jokingly says. Sometimes this is all accompanied with diarrhea. It is not ongoing as of now, no date provided. She noticed that it comes and goes and sometimes she can eat and she is fine and sometimes she gets really sick feeling. It seems like if she doesn&#39;t eat then she doesn&#39;t get the symptoms but she knows that she needs to eat. Investigations: Her doctor has been having her do platelet blood tests about every 5 days since she took the COVID vaccine. She does not remember the dates of these tests off of the top of her head. She had a blood draw at the clinic the day before her COVID vaccine and her platelet count was 49 on 08Mar2021. For the result of 29 that was either last Thursday or last Friday, 11Mar2021 or 12Mar2021. Te outcome of the event scleral discoloration was recovered on 13Mar2021, tiredness was recovered on 15Mar2021, headache was not recovered, pain in hip was recovering, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021299104 similar report from same reporter

                                                Skin reaction red rash under both armpits: Caller stated the event started the first day after the first shot then still having reaction from the second shot; Skin reaction red rash under both armpits; Ears would get warm feeling very hot; after the second shot the flare up was quicker; skin is dry from being inflamed; skin is dry from being inflamed; blossoming under the armpits and they are rosy red but no blisters; hurt was always in the center of armpit not in the armpit; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient) via Medical information team. A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 02Mar2021 14:00 (Lot Number: EN6203) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously had first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9809) on 09Feb2021 in the bicep left arm upper muscle for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included surgery from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included vitamin D3 taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient previously took Miralax. The patient previously had first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9809) on 09Feb2021 in the bicep left arm upper muscle for COVID-19 immunization and Pneumonia shot and never had swelling. The patient had rosy arm pits red rash and sometimes get a reaction in ears, if it flares up and gets hot. The patient stated, &#34;For 5 weeks I&#39;ve been taking children&#39;s Benadryl. I had a quicker reaction with the second dose than I did the first one but I still had some lingering effects from the first dose when I got the second. How long do these side effects usually last?&#34; The patient had second COVID 19 vaccine and also had first one. The first dose was on 09Feb21 and she had swelling in arm after shot and has been using a cool cloth on it and was better by the next day. The patient still feels it though and it has been five weeks. The patient tries to turn arm and can still feel it but it was not bad. A day later she had her first skin reaction which was a red rash under both armpits. The patient waited because she wanted to see what reactions she would have with second dose. The reaction from first dose happened for three weeks. The patient has been taking liquid Benadryl everyday sometimes during night and also cold wet compresses in armpits has helped with inflammation. The primary care doctor and talked to the patient to see if she should try some other medication before second shot and the nurse recommended she should not get second shot that she should see an allergist. The patient got second shot and talked to nurse there. The nurse told the patient she would have to come back at least four days after the second shot was due or it would not work together. The patient went ahead and got the vaccine and it has not been life threatening as of now. The patient saw an allergist three days after second shot. The patient had rosy red inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly bilateral armpit and then sometimes ears would get hot. The patient would take Benadryl. The physician told the patient to try to take Allegra 24 hours but the patient stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours. The patient took the Allegra medication on Sunday morning and that it worked for her for about 12 hours and she knew she could not take any more Allegra but the Benadryl seemed to help. The allergist felt she made the right decision since her events are not life-threatening since it is not respiratory. The allergist saw her armpits agreed the children Benadryl was working and that she should stick with that. The patient stated, it is not going away been like this the whole time since 02Mar2021 and still having a reaction in her armpits. The patient stated after the second shot the flare up was quicker because first shot was already in system still. It was not a flare up like when someone can not eat seafood and stuff like that. The patient still has a rosy armpit. The patient has not seen her doctor since last year when she had a physical. The patient would inform her doctor about these events. The patient stated she is really blossoming under the armpits and they are rosy red but no blisters and her skin is dry from being inflamed all this time. She squeezes a rag under her armpits and that it is better during the day than at night, it is worse at night. The patient was only taking 20 mL of Benadryl in the morning and then evening before bed. The patient stated, &#34;the first shot right at the beginning she had to take Benadryl in the middle of the night as well but got to where she was taking it 12 hours apart before second dose.&#34; The patient hopes she is not having to walk around with compresses in the summer as it is easier when it is cold and that she hopes this fazes. The patient was noticing since she had not taken a shower or hot bath this morning that she had rosy red cheeks like a rosy red U on her face. The second shot she asked the nurse to give in her back upper part of bicep in arm muscle since it was a better location and it did not swell up and it did not hurt. Caller stated the nurse the first time gave the shot like when you see people getting shots on tv they put it really high up in muscle. The patient considered the event as medically significant and that it is ongoing and has worsened. The hurt was always in the center of armpit not in the armpit. The past couple of days her skin has been dry. She has used hand cream but is afraid to put anything else on it because of reaction. Just annoying. The patient will probably put cream on it so it does not crack, it is very dry and it has not been dry like this. The patient has been putting water on at night which could have dried it out. Some days is worse than others more red. This is persisting. Soreness in arm happened right after first shot. The shot was given in the proper way but seemed like more of a reaction. The second shot is much better and that she does not feel it at all. The patient can still feel where the vaccine went in left arm. It was annoying but it does not keep her from moving her arm and it has been five weeks. Since it is not going away it is serious. The patient was not taking Benadryl in middle of day like before but it is itchy so she is going to go out in the cold and work in yard. Before first week or two she would use cool compresses all day and take Benadryl during day and then at night it petered out. The patient was hoping it will fade out eventually. The patient did not want to double up on Allegra as she is not sure what the reaction would be. The medical ingredient was Fexofenadine HCL 180mg antihistamine. The patient only took one pill as it did not work. 24 hour Allegra, 180mg antihistamine 15 tablets per box. The patient was taking Children Benadryl 20mL and would take at least every 6 six hours and was trying to hold off to now taking it 12 hours and will use cold compress if she has to. The patient usually takes Zyrtec for seasonal allergies like dust. She took no Zyrtec at all for either shots. She felt the Benadryl worked better and quicker. The patient was at the Allergist she asked what is in this vaccine like what chemical. She looked up the ingredients but did not understand. Her friend told her Polyethylene glycol was in both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine. The patient had rosy red, inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly her bilateral armpits and then sometimes ears would get hot. The patient stated her primary care physician told her to try to take Allegra 24 hours but caller stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours. The patient stated she took the Allegra medication on Sunday morning and that it worked for about 12 hours and she knew she could not take any more Allegra. The patient stated the medical ingredient was Fexofenadine HCL 180mg antihistamine. The patient stated she only took one pill as it did not work. Sample of the product was available to be returned. The packaging was sealed and intact. The outcome of the event &#34;Ears would get warm feeling very hot&#34; and &#34;after the second shot the flare up was quicker&#34; was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known safety profile, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of events rash and erythematous rash (allergy context) cannot be excluded.

It is in her ankle and feet; Hallucinations; ankle swollen; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). This 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 25Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208; Expiration Date: Jun2021) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient received the first dose on 04Mar2021 10:00 in the left arm (Batch/lot number: EN6200, Expiration Date: Jun2021) and she had headaches, arm ache, and hallucinations which would go and come. When she would try to sleep, the hallucinations would go and come but then the hallucinations stopped prior to getting the second dose. Headaches started a couple of days after the first dose probably started the next day and started coming and going. This stopped prior to the second dose probably a week or week in a half maybe two weeks before getting second dose. The headache only lasted about half a day, it wasn&#39;t that bad. She recovered completely. Arm sore, red only happened with the first dose as her arm did not hurt at all after the second. This started the next day or even the same day but she kept it comfortable and probably stopped within the first week and it did not come back either. She has recovered completely. Sharp pain through arm go and come. This started after the first dose so in that week or week in a half area and it stopped about at least a week before the second dose somewhere in that period of time. She has recovered completely. Hallucination: she was laying down at night and something would come across her head that she was not thinking.

The bottom of her heel hurt when she put pressure on it and walked on 31Mar2021. It was ongoing but was off and on and it has worsened. She had her feet up on the bed. As treatment, patient used heat, ice, and has been elevating her feet. She called her doctor and doctor told her to keep doing it since she has been doing it since Monday. With the second shot, she is not experiencing any arm pain. It is in her ankle and feet and then the hallucinations still go and come and she sees images that come still but do not stay they just go and come. After the second dose, she had this last night and the night before last, she would not be thinking it but it would appear in her mind and she was wondering why it was doing that but she thought maybe a week or two it will stop and come down. This started on 28Mar2021, Sunday after the second dose and is still going on. Outcome of the event ankle swollen was recovered on 30Mar2021, of the event arthralgia was unknown, and of the other events was not recovered.

                                                I immediately sat down for 1 hour, felt I had something , like i felt possible slight chest tightness. I say I was fine until 3-4 hours later, I had extreme headaches. At 430pm, I still had the headaches and I took Tylenol 500mg. At night my headache got worse and it felt like I had the flu. I then went to bed and when I woke up my left arm felt intense like hornets and it was swollen. I then took another Tylenol and Ibuprofen 600mg. At 4am, I felt awful and horrible. I had joint pain with aches, felt nauseated. I called my PCP and he told me to take Prednisone 10mg. My fever was 101.4F. By the night my fever was gradually coming down and it was 102F. By the next day I felt much better.  I also had Covid-19 on March 2020 and also got tested for antibody test in July 2020.  I spoke with my PCP and he is recommending I do not take the 2nd dose injection.

                                                Patient is a 68yo female with a PMH s/f of osteoarthritis, CHF, TIA with right limb weakness and aphasia and HTN presenting with a 1 week history of bilateral upper and lower extremity pain, stiffness and weakness. Patient states that she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/14 last week at pharmacy. At the time of inoculation, she did not experience any symptoms and went home after the 15 minute waiting period. The next day, she developed a generalized headache that started in her neck and continued over her head. She states that this continued to get worse throughout the day and on Saturday, she woke up and described a constant, 10/10, dull-aching pain that started at her neck/back of head and extended down to her shoulders to the tips of her fingers. She also stated that she had the same pain starting around her groin extending down to her knees and ankles. Patient initially tried taking Tylenol and ibuprofen to treat the pain, and said that those treatments normally work for her osteoarthritis, but that her pain did not improve afterwards.  In addition to the pain, she also states that she developed worsening weakness to the point where she could not walk around her home. She stated that she thought moving around and being active had helped her fight through the pain and tolerate it, but that laying down and resting actually seemed to make it worse.  With her symptoms worsening and her inability to walk, she decided to come to the hospital to get further treatment. She denied ever having an adverse reaction to other vaccines she has received previously. She receives the flu vaccine every year, and received measles, polio and other childhood vaccinations that she could not recall. She was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica and started on 20mg prednisone daily. She had a remarkable response to the steroids and her symptoms resolved within 24 hours. She was discharged on her 3rd day of admission.   On ROS, she denies fevers, chills, night sweats, SOB, changes to vision, eye pain, cough, chest pain, sputum production, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria or hematuria. She affirmed weight loss, headache, neck stiffness, dizziness, lightheadedness, muscle stiffness/pain, reduced ROM, and urinary urgency and incontinence.

This 68-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 12Jan2021 13:30 on Arm Left at single dose (lot: EK9231, Expiry: 30Apr2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Give her a follow up appointment for a second dose, that will be 02 Feb at 1:20 PM. Medical History included arthritis and had surgery for right knee replacement 6 years ago (2015). They are trying to figure out, she has water in her ear she has had CT scans recently trying to check for any problems that could be corrected surgically and that was all clean. She has had a mammogram, she was not sure about the mammogram yet but she thinks they would have called her if there was a problem with that. Historical vaccine included Just mild stuff with the flu vaccine for immunisation on occasion she has had similar reactions that were very mild with the flu vaccine and last year she had none of that at all. She says when she has had any other vaccine, she had no reaction other than maybe a slightly sore arm. No other products. She did have some mild side effects. She was really glad she got this shot. She said she had experienced some chilling on 13Jan2021, these are all very mild symptoms. She had a sore throat on 13Jan2021, some aching, like body aches on 13Jan2021 and joint tenderness on 13Jan2021. She just got chilled every once in a while. It was not very bad. She said the sore throat had persisted about the same, but the coffee helped. She was having some swelling at the injection site that was about the same as when it began on 13Jan2021. She was having some arm tenderness on 13Jan2021. She did not have any adverse reactions yesterday (12Jan2021) she was so excited to get it. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 11Jan2021 5:15 PM at a single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing shellfish allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing iodine allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing Mitral valve prolapse (for 20 years), blood pressure high, and cholesterol. The patient had mitral valve prolapse for about 20 years now. They are just watching it now. She just saw the cardiologist, and had an echo done. If the symptoms worsen, they will proceed. Concomitant medications included diltiazem for blood pressure high and atorvastatin for cholesterol, both from an unspecified date and ongoing; she has been on these medications for 30 years now. On 11Jan2021, the patient experienced facial tingling, immediate pain in arm from injection, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all, left eye twitching, chills, nausea, no appetite, whole body ache, tired, whole body trembled, nervous. On 12Jan2021, the patient experienced back pain. The patient explained that on 11Jan2021, evening at 5:15pm, she received her first COVID 19 vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine was being given out at that time. She has shellfish and iodine allergies. So, they made her sit and wait 30 minutes after being injected. One of her daughters took her. On the drive home, a few minutes after leaving she developed facial tingling. At first, she thought nothing of it. She did have immediate pain in her arm from the injection. By the time she got home, she couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all. It was that painful. The next morning, she couldn&#39;t lift arm, and if she tried, she would be in pain. Also, her left eye started twitching right away also. That night she really noticed it. It was not a constant twitching. She thought at first it was because she was tired or from the pain in her body. But then she noticed the next day it was still doing that. It was still twitching. It is not constant, but it was here and there. She still had it on 13Jan2021, but so far nothing at the day of report (14Jan2021). She also had chills. She had on double clothes, and coverings on her feet and hands. The chills wouldn&#39;t go away. Her whole body trembled. On 13Jan2021, Wednesday morning, they went away. She experienced nausea and no appetite. Her whole body ached. It was so brutal. The problem was with her left eye. It didn&#39;t twitch constantly, but it got her nervous. She is pretty sure she is going to refuse the second dose. She has heard that the 2nd part is when most people have the worst side effects. So, she is not comfortable getting it. She also got back pain. It wasn&#39;t severe, but it was there. She is against getting the second shot. She stated that she is a medical assistant at a pediatric office. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She got it (vaccine) because of her age. She was advised to get it as she was around patients. Work gave them the option. The inability to move her arm ended in the middle of night at 4 am 14Jan 2021. She noticed she could move her arm. Her second dose is scheduled for 01Feb2021 at 8:45 am. She does work in a pediatric office. If the second part of side effects are worse, then she doesn&#39;t want to take the chance. The eye has her concerned. Outcome of the events were as follows: facial tingling recovered on 11Jan2021, immediate pain in arm from injection recovered on 13Jan2021, chills recovered on 13Jan2021, nausea recovered on 13Jan2021, no appetite recovered on 13Jan2021, whole body ache recovered on 13Jan2021, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all recovered on 14Jan2021, back pain was recovering, while outcome for events left eye twitching, tired, whole body trembled, and nervous, was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

By Midnight, I had excruciating nerve pain shooting across my lower back along with the muscular back pain.   I was up all night in pain.   I did not take anything for the pain for fear of comprising the vaccine.   the next day pain was worse, called my doctor and was told I could take Tramadol, 50 mg.   It did nothing for the pain until I took another dose.   Pain got worse and I was unable to get myself out of bed, or from a sitting position without my husband pulling me up.   My muscles were not working, or it was just too painful, I&#39;m not sure.    Could barely walk.   This lasted for 3 full days and then the pain gradually started to subside.    Took a full week for back pain to totally go away.

                                                It  has now been 8 days since my first dose of Pzifer vaccine (February 1, 2021) and I have been experiencing painful, aching quads in both legs and groin area.  Have taken Advil to relieve pain and still feel intense  throbing legs and especially the R groin area.  On a scale of 1-10 it is a 7-8.  Ten years ago I was diagonosed with Osetomyletics and the blood infection landed on my pelvic area and I was unable to walk .  Spent a week in the hospital and infectious disease doctors put a port in my chest an for 1 month was on heavy duty antibotics to rid the infection.  I am experiencing the pain in the same area of the groin, but now the quad muscles  are equally painfully.  I am concerned as it has now been 8 days and there is NO relief to my pain and I am assuming it is a side effect of the vaccine?  Please adivse.

A 68-year-old female (not pregnant) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 14Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), previous TIA (Transient ischemic attack) with some residual right sided weakness, CHF (congestive heart failure), osteoarthritis. Had a childhood vaccination history. No Known allergies. Concomitant medications included albuterol, aspirin, atorvastatin, fluticasone, furosemide, hydralazine, ibuprofen, lisinopril, metoprolol, multivitamin, all above were in two weeks (as of 25Jan2021). The patient previously received influenza vaccine yearly, and received her pneumonia vaccines over the last several years, both for immunization and never had a reaction to a vaccine. The patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. No other vaccine received in four weeks. The patient developed a dull headache on 15Jan2021, one date after the vaccine, but that it resolved after 24 hours on 16Jan2021. On 16Jan2021 at 8:00 AM, the patient developed bilateral proximal muscle stiffness, weakness, and pain in her upper and lower extremities over the course of 1 week. The patient started experiencing this bilateral upper and lower extremity pain, stiffness and weakness beginning at the shoulders and hips and extending distally over several days. Her symptoms started out relatively mild and progressively got worse over the course of 7 days. She presented to the reporting healthcare professional 8 days after her vaccination and she was extremely weak and could not support herself to walk around in her home, the reporting healthcare professional suspect polymyalgia rheumatica. All the events (except dull headache) resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization. The patient was hospitalization due to all the above events for 3 days. The patient had a remarkable response to the treatment of prednisone during her hospitalization. It was unknown if covid prior vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included COVID tested (COVID test type: Nasal Swab, SARS-COVID19 PCR) post vaccination on 23Jan2021: Negative. Outcome of event headache was recovered on 16Jan2021 and all the events was recovered on an unspecified date.   Information about lot/batch number was requested; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded, considering the temporal relationship.  However, it is worth noting that the 68-year-old female patient had pre-existing osteoarthritis, which could be one of the causes of joint symptoms.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Sometimes have occasional pain little bit in some of the other joints, this is a little bit more than joint pain. Consumer stated, that she received the first dose of this Pfizer Vaccine on 12Jan2021. And about four days after during the night she was feeling some kind of burning, tingling sensations around ankles and knees and lower leg. It went away it lasted maybe about 4 hours, but then yesterday which is on the 22nd started in early afternoon started feeling the same thing, the feet and the toes, around ankles, up the legs and around the knees. Sometime it feels like it&#39;s a mild burning radiating from you know around the joints and in the lower leg too. It is mainly feet up to above the knees, burning, tingling, radiating. And sometimes I have occasional pain in just a little bit in some of the other joints you know that&#39;s been going on after the vaccine occasionally. The heat from the elbow (not clarified further), besides the knees and the ankle and the toes. The patient called this number because that is the number that was on the page to say if there was anything to report and then you know she was wondering if this is, she saw that some of the side effects could be joint pain but this is a little bit more than joint pain. So, she was wondering if there is anything. She mean she was going to see doctor on Monday, this has been going on for more than 30 hours now, but she was wondering if there is any advice in this. Pricking pain in her left hip started on 12Jan2021, Little bit of cramping in left foot started on 12Jan2021, Knees, ankles and feet, the lower leg felt cramp, like a radiating pain started on 16Jan2021. Consumer stated, initially, when she just got the vaccine, she felt a little prick in her left hip, like a little pain but it did not stay, pricking pain in her left hip. A little bit of cramping in her left foot, but it went away. So she did not think anything of it. 4 days later, on the 16Jan2021 (later confirmed), during the night her knees, her ankles and feet, the lower leg felt cramp, like a radiating pain. It was not very severe, like a mild pain in the knees and the lower legs and feet, a type of tingling but it went away. Pain was like a radiating, sort of burning but it was mild burn. Date when started experiencing pain is on the same day, 12Jan2021. Lab work was no. Treatment was no, because it was transient but afterwards what concerned her is on Friday which is the 22nd, she started experiencing a pain in knees, ankles and feet and lower leg with the cramping and tingling, mostly tingling and burning like a radiating pain. The whole, above her knees, down the lower leg, ankles, feet and toes and it continued up till last night and so more than for 30 hours that is what concerned her. That is why she called last night. The outcome of the event feeling hot , pain in extremity, muscle spasm was unknown, of the other events was not recovered.

The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EJ1685) on 16Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced community acquired pneumonia, shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness, fatigue, COPD, muscle aches and pains, she became ill, all on12Jan2021; arm soreness on an unspecified date. Events required Emergency Room visit. Clinical course reported as: she got the second dose of the pfizer covid vaccine on 06Jan2021 and on 12Jan2021 she experienced shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness and fatigue. Nurse stated ER doctor thought she had COPD or community acquired pneumonia. Nurse further stated she had the second COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021. A week later on 12Jan2021, she became ill. She had all the symptoms of COVID. She was short of breath, very fatigued. She couldn&#39;t get any air, she was at work. She had muscle aches and pains. The shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness lasted several days. She also had severe chest congestion. She confirmed she got better. It actually took 4 or 5 days. By that Sunday (17Jan2021) she was better. She wanted it noted she had no reaction right after the shot. She stated she only had arm soreness, it was just a little sore, not even worth mentioning. It was only when she moved her arm a certain way. This was with either vaccine (first or second vaccine). She went to the doctor and somebody thought it might be a reaction, but the nurse thought it was too late for a reaction. The ER doctor thought it was COPD and community acquired pneumonia. Her primary doctor thought it was COPD. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test: negative on 12Jan2021. Outcome of arm soreness was unknown, others was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the drug-event time interval and the vaccine&#39;s safety profile, the  community acquired pneumonia is possibly intercurrent condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162B2 administration, which is not the disease that the vaccine BNT162B2 can prevent from. While the COPD is more likely underlying condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162 injection.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

After dose 1, 5 days after I had itching, prickly tingly sensations everywhere, especially arms, legs, neck, and back. These lasted for 11 days after that, finally subsided. But then I got dose 2, and had sore arm, and next day, aches in muscles, low fever, congestion but all mild. Took ibuprofen and went away after 24 hours. 5 days later, the itching, tingling started up again and was more intense and everywhere. Have had some redness, swelling, red bumps in itchy areas, they come and go. Worse when I have hot flash. Itching is keeping me awake along with anxiety and restlessness. Hope this won&#39;t last for another 10 days, very uncomfortable.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot #: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 17Jan2021 at 15:00 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included benign spinal cord tumor from 1987 and unspecified if ongoing (a lot of bone had to get cut), lot of scar tissue (wonders if it is a weak spot) from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing, thyroid removed in 2015, neurosurgery (to remove the benign spinal cord tumor) on an unspecified date, thyroid on an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing and cholesterol from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing levothyroxine (strength: 125 ug) taken for an unspecified indication at 125 ug, 1x/day, ongoing pravastatin (strength: 40mg) taken for cholesterol from an unspecified date at 40mg, 1x/day and ongoing multivitamin. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient experienced lower back pain, nerve pain, excruciating pain/getting pain, muscle pain, couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and her husband had to pull her out of the bed because she felt she had no muscle activity, all on 17Jan2021. The patient called and stated &#34;she had a very extreme reaction from the first dose of the vaccine, which she had last Sunday the 17th. It began with lower back pain, which did not alarm her too much but then it went in to nerve pain. By the end of the evening, by about midnight, she was in what she considered to be excruciating pain. She changed positions and it was hitting the nerve and she was getting pain and having muscle pain. She was up all night because she could not sleep with the pain. Monday and Tuesday were very excruciating, and she took Tramadol Monday after consulting with her doctor. She did not get any relief until Wednesday, 3 days after the shot. Even today she had some lower back pain, but it is way better than it was. It was improving from Wednesday to today but Sunday to Wednesday was excruciating since it was giving her nerve pain. Her husband had to pull her out of the bed because she felt she had no muscle activity. In 1987 she had a spinal cord tumor and a lot of bone had to get cut and she stated she was sure she had a lot of scar tissue and wondered if it was a weak spot. She stated this could be an isolated incident, but she really thought she had another tumor at first until it started dissipating on its own. She stated she did not know anyone who has had this reaction and asked if it was safe/advisable to get the second shot? She stated she was afraid of the permanent nerve damage but as long as it cannot do anything permanent, she wanted to get it. Was this a reported symptom? Has anyone ever gotten paralyzed? After verbal response she stated she will talk with her doctor and maybe see a neurologist.&#34; Upon follow-up the patient called and stated &#34;I had two questions actually. I received the Pfizer Vaccine yesterday and last night I started with the excruciating back pain, my lower back. I do not know if it was coincidence or not because I have back trouble before. I did not do anything to throw my back out. However, I was told it would be okay to take Extra Strength Tylenol. I took 4 Tylenol within like 3 hours period because it was not working. I took another two this morning. Tylenol was not doing anything at all for the pain relief. My question was, I have a prescription of Tramadol which I took for pain for different reason, but I have it. First of all, I hope by taking the Tylenol yesterday that it did not interfere with the efficiency of the vaccine. My other question is can I take the Tramadol now? Since the vaccine was 24 hours ago would it interfere with efficiency?&#34; Upon follow-up the patient called to report that &#34;she went to her chiropractor late Wednesday afternoon, and he did some stretching, but her spine was not out of alignment, so he felt her pain was due to the vaccine. Stated that it was not until her back started getting better on Wednesday without treatment that she first started to attribute it to the vaccine, because her back just did not get better on its own. Stated that the first day she did not take anything for the pain because she was worried that it might interact with the vaccine or its effectiveness, but the next day she began taking Tramadol pain meds that she already had in the house for her knee. Stated that the pain in her back was so bad, that even a strong medication like the Tramadol did not take away the pain. It did not help all that much, she had to take a 2nd 50mg tablet 3 hours later. Should she get the second dose of the vaccine? Could it possibly do more nerve damage; could she be jeopardizing her nervous system? Have there been any other reports about this? Stated that other people had minor things like, one person reported being tired for a couple days, and another person reported body aches like with the flu, but after 3 days they both were fine. Her husband was 74 and had the vaccine and he had no side effects.&#34; The events prompted a visit to her physician. The patient stated that &#34;this was the first day since Sunday that she was feeling almost 100%. She had the pain from Sunday evening all the way until noon on Wednesday; at that point it improved about 50% and she had some mobility.&#34; The outcomes of the events lower back pain, nerve pain, excruciating pain/getting pain, muscle pain, couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and her husband had to pull her out of the bed because she felt she had no muscle activity were all recovering/resolving.

A 68-year-old female patient received first single dose BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 29Jan2021 15:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insomnia and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated, &#34;I got the vaccine yesterday about 3 pm and I came home and I had dinner and sat down to watch TV at 9 O&#39; clock, I turn the program on and I was out like a &#39;light&#39; and this stuff knock me out (onset date: 29Jan2021). My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Called my PCP and left message.  Coughed an asthmatic cough Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. On Monday, Feb. 8 called PCP again. We had a virtual visit.  He said, it was not an allergic reaction.  He prescribed Prednisone and Alburetol inhaler.  On Thursday Feb . 11 I got a rash all over my body that came and went and I got Hives on the palms of my hands. Virtual visit with  my PCP. He said that he retracted his statement from Monday and evidently I was having a reaction to the Vaccine.  I kept taking the Steroid which I finished on Monday.  The rash and hives bothered me till  Monday. Tuesday and Wednesday rash and hives gone.  On Thursday morning I woke up with a burning pain across my left side of my chest to the backside and pain on my knees.  On Friday the pain was also on the backside of my waist.  It felt like shingles.  Went to see the NP at Dr. office.   They don&#39;t think I have shingles.  This is all still a reaction to the vaccine.

                                                3 days after the vaccination I woke up with pain around 7 joints (2 hips 2 shoulders 2 knees and 1right wrist)Right shoulder the worst pain....i was vaccinate in left shoulder.  It is now about 3 weeks later and there is no change.  I was prescribed a  burst of prednisone  333,22,11 20 mg. It felt good while taking but returned when done.  As of today there is no sign of improvement and I am seeking advise about shot #2 which is scheduled for March 2. (in 4 days)

A 68-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on her left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure (Diagnosed 3 to 4 years ago) and thyroid disorder. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient got the vaccine on Saturday and went home and fell asleep, woke up and had lumps in back of neck, they hurt, pain goes around into jaw, up into the face and ear hurts. The patient just tried a hot compress, a hot cloth on there, it seemed to help a little bit for a while. Took some Advil and that helped a little bit, but when it wears off it comes back. Adds she felt dizzy too, and still felt like that too, it started right after she got it, and it comes and goes. The outcome of the event dizzy was unknown while not recovered for the remaining events.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Received the shot around noon on Tuesday , February 23, 2021. Later in the afternoon experienced muscle aches and chills. My head felt kind of weird. Hard to describe except I once had a morphine shot that made me feel close. I spent the next ~60 hours in bed. Fever, severe joint and muscle pain, migraine like headache, and brain fog is about all I remember. It could have been 2 hours or 60  hours, I don&#39;t remember. On Wednesday and Thursday my sedentary heart rate was 101 and 95 according to my Apple watch up from 77 on Tuesday. Couldn?t eat. Food tasted and smelled differently but not in a good way. Woke up this morning,Friday, with a mild headache and very fatigued but mostly back to normal.

Anyway--just  reporting this b/c I was asked to and am hoping for the  best!  I did have a sore arm, muscle aches and chills so I know that I got some.

Then I did feel better for a few days but had some tiredness.   Then Sunday the 28th my body seemed over whelmed with sweats and chills, I developed a rash in my groin area and realized that I had a yeast infection that was affecting my vaginal area, groin, and mouth.  I have been treating this with a natural yeast complex and Monistat.   I am starting to do better today but felt that I needed to report it to see if others were having the same problem.  I feel that the injection adversely affected my body&#39;s normal  hemostasis and the yeast was the results.  I am not looking forward to getting the next shot.  I think I did have Covid 19 in late January or early February before it  was widely known  and there were no tests.   I will keep treating myself with natural remedies as chemicals will just inflame the yeast at this time.  This is not life threatening but wanted to report the abnormal reaction I have experienced.

Treated in an ambulance at vaccine site with IV Benadryl, had some skin tingling, also given IV solumedrol and observed for almost 2 hours with no other symptoms. I was also hypertensive, probably due to anxiety.

My face was flushed and my throat began to tighten a little  The headache and flush lasted about an hour.  (I had taken Tylenol right after getting the vaccine.)  The throat symptoms lasted longer ,lessening slightly after about an hour and a half.  Never had trouble breathing, talking, eating or drinking.  But the feeling has lasted into the late evening to a very mild degree; as if something is caught at the back of the throat, or the back of the tongue feels a little fuzzy.

                                                About two hours after receiving the Pfizer vaccine shot #1, my left arm became numb and stiff, starting at my wrist and worked up my upper arm. I could not lift my left arm at all, but when I tried, the pain was severe and radiated over the left half of my chest and over my heart.  I thought this might be a passing reaction, and went to bed early. My condition was the same in the morning, and I contacted my doctor, who directed me to go to the emergency room or to Urgent Care, which I did.

                                                Intense pain in lower back and right hip and pain down my legs (all weak and vulnerable areas where I have issues now and then). It is bothersome to the point that I cannot find a comfortable position to relieve the pain.  It feels like my lower body is being seized up, so to speak.  The only way I can sleep is to take 2 Aleeve PM tablets. I take regular Aleeve throughout the day to take the edge off the pain.   The reason I suspect it is a side effect is that a year ago I took the new Shingles 2-dose vaccination.  I had this same reaction after taking the first dose - and it occurred about 2 weeks after that shot.

There was no medical history and concomitant medications reported. In Dec2020, the patient experienced that the muscles in her arm started hurting. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                Patient is a 68 y/o female who enrolled in program on 9/19/2018 who began monotherapy treatment with Pioglitazone 15mg PO on 10/5/2018. Patient called study team stating that she received her second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination on 02/19/21.  Afterwards, she had a sore arm and slept most of the next day.  On 02/21/21, she experienced severe right-sided leg weakness and fell while attempting to go to the bathroom.  She was unable to ambulate and her son took her to the emergency room. She was hospitalized overnight for a serious adverse reaction to the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination.  Multiple sclerosis exacerbation was ruled out after extensive testing. Then, she was transferred a Rehab facility on 02/22/21 for physical therapy and occupational therapy.  She continues study medication without any missed doses.  She will most likely be in Rehab for another week.  She was able to walk 80 feet on 2/25/2021 with a walker and gait belt and ambulatory assistance. This is unrelated to study drug. We consider this to be a Non-UP SAE.  As of 3/4/2021 the patient is still in rehab.

All expect the inflamed elbow were not a surprise.  I treated my elbow with an ice pack during the day on 3/2 and by 3/4 it had improved.  By 3/5 it was no longer inflamed, red or warm, but is still tender to lean on.  I informed my doctor&#39;s office of this.

                                                The injection site appears to be too high on my left shoulder and not properly placed in the deltoid muscle. I developed severe left shoulder joint pain by the afternoon March 5. By bedtime, the pain was excruciating and continues to be severe, not in my arm, but in my left shoulder joint.  I had adhesive capsulitis several years ago and completely recovered, but it took two years to get back my health plus a steroid injection and physical therapy.  I know what adhesive capsulitis feels like.  And this is what my left shoulder socket feels like now.  I had no idea this was a risk of a vaccination. I have sent an email to report this injury to UCSF and also requested an appointment with my doctor.   This type of injury from vaccination should be avoided and is avoidable.

UPON WAKING DAY TWO, I HAD A VERY PRONOUNCED ACHE IN THE BACK OF LEFT SHOULDER AND THE ACTUAL SHOULDER BLADE WAS SORE AND PAINFUL TO THE TOUCH. I DID NOTHING THE FIRST DAY OF THE DISCOMFORT (THINKING IT WOULD GO AWAY). I NOW APPLY CBD/THC BALM ON THE AREA 3 TIMES A DAY AND I&#39;VE BEEN TAKING EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL , TWO TABLETS,  THREE TIMES A DAY. I AM SLEEPING IN A ZERO-GRAVITY MODE ON MY SLEEP NUMBER BED...OTHERWISE I CAN&#39;T SLEEP AT ALL.  I HAD A HOLE IN MY ROTATOR CUFF SURGUCIALLY REPAIRED ABOUT 18 MONTHS AGO AND THE PAIN I HAVE NOW ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE MY SHOULDER FELT BEFORE AND FOR AWHILE AFTER THE SURGERY! I AM BEGINNING TO WONDER IF THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP TO THE TWO EVENTS.

                                                I received the first vaccine around 10:00 in the morning.   Symptoms hit about Midnight.  Started with a headache,  a mild sore throat, fever 100.1, body and joint aches, chills, and then a few times the next day of being extremely tired, only lasted for about 24 hours.  After the second vaccine,  I had all of the previous symptoms again but this time the chills lasted for about 3 hours which was a lot longer.  Lasted again about 24 hours and then a few times of feeling extremely tired the next couple of days.  I should also let you know that I did test positive for COVID around November 6, 2020, and had mild symptoms for a full week.

A day later my left arm muscle was very sore (not the injection site, the whole upper arm muscle).  Three weeks after the shot, my arm is still very sore and I can hardly use my left arm.  It&#39;s very painful to get dressed, take off a jacket, shirt, etc.  I can hardly use the left arm to hold anything due to the pain in the muscle.

I also noticed what I would describe as discomfort in the lymph system.  Also, I have difficulty thinking clearly.  Tasks that I  usually complete easily such as online banking have been more difficult.  I&#39;m making mistakes.  As I write this I am now three days from the inoculation.  I have burning pain under my right arm.  I have burning pain in tops of my feet.  My hip joints are stiff.  My eyes are sore.  I feel generally fatigued.  This is not my normal level of functioning.

Further she explained this morning I felt better I didn&#39;t have pressure on my chest or anything but the pressure on my jaw that go up to my head. Is that related to the vaccine or is something that I have to worry about?&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;The second one is going to be on 12Feb2021, this Friday.&#34; Patient stated, &#34;No, I was calling because today I feel better, I don&#39;t have the pressure on my chest. But I still have the pressure on my jaw and on my kind of my head. But no I have not called anybody. It&#39;s not like an emergency, I am calling because I was not sure about this is related to the vaccine.&#34; For treatment consumer stated, &#34;No, today I took some Tylenol, that&#39;s all.&#34; No investigation assessment. The outcome of the event &#39;Light-headed&#39; was recovering, the patient recovered from the event &#39;Pressure in my chest&#39; on an unspecified date, was not recovered form Pressure on my jaw and shoulder, my left shoulder; pressure on my jaw that go up to my head and was unknown for other events.

                                                a significant headache this morning with pain focused at the front of her head; Weak feeling; feelings of weakness in her legs when walking; sore throat; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 68-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9263) solution for injection, intramuscular on left deltoid on 26Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant medication was reported as none. The patient received the first dose of COVID vaccine on 26Jan2021 and reported a significant headache this morning with pain focused at the front of her head after she was up for a while, she also had a weak feeling, feelings of weakness in her legs when walking and a sore throat, all on 02Feb2021. Her headache was very bad, but after treating with 2 tablets of extra strength paracetamol (TYLENOL) 500 mg, her headache was not as bad as it was. This happened suddenly. Her sore throat started the same time as the headache which was currently gone. She wanted to know if these events could be from the vaccine, a week later; if she should get a COVID test; and how long will the headache last if it came back. The outcome of the headache was recovering and recovered on 02Feb2021 for all other events.

A 68-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6201; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 19Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The vaccine was administered in a Public Health Clinic/Veterans Administration facility. Medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She had about 3 surgeries in lumbar area for fusions due to scoliosis in the past years (history of failed lumbar fusions due to scoliosis). Last one was about 5 years ago. Concomitant medications included roflumilast (DALIRESP), duloxetine, loratadine, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) and &#34;Spiri&#34;. The patient previously received pethidine hydrochloride (DEMEROL) and experienced allergies; and previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9264) in the right arm, on 28Jan2021 at 14:00, for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced a little lower back, bilateral hip and groin pain on 30Jan2021. The pain increased as time went on. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, after second injection, the pain (from first injection) became more intense and now has gone up to mid back and shoulders to the point where it hurts to walk, and she trips a lot. Nothing controls the pain including narcotics, heat, ice, Tylenol or ibuprofen. The pain was further described as constant burning, soreness, aching, stabbing and stiffening. The events were considered serious as the events resulted in disability or permanent damage. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association a contributory role of bnt162b2  to  the reported events  cannot  be totally  excluded.  The patient&#39;s history of scoliosis and failed lumbar fusions may also be contributory to the events.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is  received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had difficulty walking after approximately 27 hours of vaccination, severe pain in groin on both sides.   Within approximately 48-72 hours I developed a severe bursitis on my left elbow, approximately 6 inches from the vaccination site - I had never had a bursitis before. The difficulty walking lessened after a few days, but I am still sore, possibly due to  bursae by joints.  I had a severe headache after approximately 48 hours which lasted for approximately 5 days.  My arm is still sore at the injection site more than 2 weeks after the vaccination.

I took Azathioprine 500mg prior to dental appt. The groin discomfort lasted until 3/22/21 night/none arising 3/23/21. Also had left groin and lower back and rt butt cheek discomfort 3/22/21. Of course with the replacement hip (2010) and dental, I am concerned the discomfort on the RHS is hip replacement related nit Covid but Pharmacist suggested I write it up.

                                                Evening of the vaccination, there was joint pain. Day after the vaccination, the right knee became swollen and very painful. This knee had been replaced the previous Sept. The swelling and pain lasted about 6 days. The swelling went down but did not diminish entirely. The pain went down but only somewhat, leaving consistent pain in the knee since then, Pain is evident upon walking, when sitting down or standing up and sometimes, when resting.       I would not have tied this to the vaccine except that my husband, who also had a knee replacement, had the same reaction of swelling and serious pain for the same number of days, His knee replacement was done 5 years ago, and, he normally has no pain or swelling. His has cleared up.

A 68-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 04Mar2021 08:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included multiple sclerosis from 1994 and ongoing Verbatim: MS. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included Tdap vaccine (DPT VACCINE) on 18Feb2016 for vaccination. The patient stated that she was looking for direction as well as reporting an exacerbation of MS following her first dose of the vaccine, clarified as the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, on 04Mar2021. Weight: Caller stated she would give her Covid weight. HCP: Caller reported that she is unsure of MD zip code.  She reported that the phone number for her MD ends in DOCS but she did not know which numbers that corresponded to. Caller reported that she did not experience any of the common side effects from the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  She did not experience a sore arm, fever, muscle aches, none of that.  She reported that she did not have any side effects until the afternoon of Saturday, 06Mar2021. Caller reported that she&#39;s had MS for many many years and that it has been in what she calls remission for a long time.  She stated that the last exacerbation she experienced was following a Tdap vaccination five years before.  Because of this experience, when the Covid vaccine came out, she went through her doctor to see what she should do, if she should get it.  Her doctor recommended that she get the Covid-19 vaccine, but told the caller that she should make sure to go to a health care facility to receive it instead of drugstore or a clinic due to her experience following the Tdap vaccine in 2016. Caller reports that she is now having a similar exacerbation following the Covid-19 vaccine. Exacerbation of MS: Caller stated that it is an ongoing exacerbation that is not getting better.  She stated that she&#39;s sure that it will get better, but she is not sure what she should do about the second dose. Legs weak, numb, tingly: Caller reported that the weakness, numbness, and tingling in her legs was progressive.  She stated that the weakness, numbness, and tingling began on Saturday afternoon, 06Mar2021, in her feet and lower legs, and had then progressed to her thighs by Sunday 07Mar2021 or Monday 08Mar2021. Arms are weak, numb, tingly: Caller reported  that she noticed on Sunday, 07Mar2021 that her hands were a little clumsy.  She reported that throughout the day of Sunday, 07Mar2021 and Monday, 08Mar2021, the numbness and tingling progressed into her upper arm. Facial tingling: Caller originally stated that she has been experiencing a lot of nerve sensation, then clarified as facial tingling, in particular around the mouth, below the nose, and on both sides of her face.  She stated that it began on Sunday, 07Mar2021 and was intermittently present on 08Mar2021 probably into 09Mar2021, then it just went away.  She stated that it would come and go. Caller reported that while she is able to walk and has not had to use her wheelchair, that it is a struggle to walk.  She also reported that it is a struggle to do things with her arms and hands.  She stated that if she wanted to eat, in order to pick up the fork she would probably be using 2 hands to get the fork up but can use it once it&#39;s in her hands.  She also reported that a pencil is difficult to pick up as well, stating that she would need to use both hands to pick it up but would be able to use the pencil once she had picked it up. Caller reported that the tingling comes and goes, and she experiences varying degrees of numbness.  She reported that they are a little numb throughout the day and it may get worse depending on what she&#39;s doing. She stated that she isn&#39;t a sitter, she has to get up and move. Caller reported that she called her physician, about the side effects she was experiencing and they instructed her to go to the Emergency Room.  She stated that their concern was what was going on and if it could be Guillain Barre disease, which she stated is extremely rare. Caller reported that when she went to the Emergency Room on 09Mar2021, they did not really do any tests.  She stated that in order to see if there were any new lesions for the MS, they would have to do an MRI of her brain. Caller reported that they did not believe that there were any new lesions, that they thought it was old lesions.  Caller reported that they told her to go home and make an appointment with the neurology resident clinic for that week, clarified as last week, week of 09Mar2021.  Caller reported that she called the neurology clinic as she does not currently have a neurologist, and they informed her that they would not be able to get her in for an appointment until the end of Apr2021.  She stated this was not doing her much good. Caller stated that they had wanted to admit her to the hospital, but told her that she could go home if she promised to follow up with the neurology resident clinic. Caller expressed some frustration, stating that she was really trying to reach out to see what she should do regarding the second dose.  Her physician tells her to go to the Emergency Room, the Emergency Room tells her to go to neurology.  She wants to know what will the second dose do.  She stated that she called the (state) chapter of the national MS society this morning, where they informed her that they had not heard any reports of exacerbations from the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller states that getting additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine is a lifelong decision.  She stated that Covid may not always be a pandemic, but it could come back like a yearly flu.  She stated that because additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine could be required, she wanted guidance on how to proceed. Her second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is scheduled for 25Mar2021. Clinical outcome of facial tingling was recovered on 09Mar2021, while for the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 14:40 (lot number: EW0150) at age of 68 years as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low vitamin D, lungs were working at 75% the capacity of an 84 year old and not 68 year old and asthma attacks. Concomitant medications included vitamin D2 and D3 and regular vitamins for low vitamin D, had been taking that for 6-7 weeks, tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT) 2.5mcg takes 2 inhales a day in the morning and salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR) 2 puffs and a special medication because her lungs were working at 75% the capacity of an 84 year old and not 68 year old and put her on an asthma medication to open her lungs. Patient got a flu shot every year and got it in Jan2021 and nothing. Patient stated that her symptoms were mild. Patient stated on day 1 after she got the shot she had nothing, that was 07Apr2021. Stated the next day (08Apr2021) she did not have injection site soreness but 2 inches below the injection site the muscle was hard and swollen and sore and remained that way for days 2, 3 and about day 4 it started to recede and day 7 it was tender. Stated it was one muscle and it was below the injection site, not at the injection site. Stated it was a lifting muscle, if she lifted her arm up it could only go so far and she would feel it and drop her arm down. Stated she got the injection in her left arm as she used it the least. Stated on days 2 (09Apr2021), 3 and 4 she had weakness with climbing stairs and with exertion, she could do it but she would notice it was more of a struggle. Stated that today she was off kilter again. Patient relayed that she looked all over online to see if she was sick with something. Stated she was tired on days 3 (10Apr2021) and 4 and that on days 5 (12Apr2021) and 6 she had tons of energy and she worked from dawn to dusk waxing floors and never has that much energy when she was normal. Stated that all of a sudden on day 5 and 6 she was perfect and then toward the evening of day 6 she thought it was her as she had to go to the Secretary of States and stand in line to renew her license and she did well and got home and started feeling tired. States she woke up last night of day 6 (13Apr2021) with a burning in her stomach and a stomach ache and it woke her and made her feel like she had food poisoning or something like that and nothing happened and she took 2 Tums and it kind of settled that down. Stated on day 7 (14Apr2021) she woke up and the stomach part was gone and all of a sudden she got really really hot, she runs about 97-97.4 and she got so hot and her face got really red like she had a high fever and she was 99.2, which is not much for most people but she feels and she took Motrin and after that she still feels a heaviness in her eyes and her temperature is 98.6 and she is normally in the 97&#39;s and was running a 2 degree fever and now maybe a 1 degree fever and she felt it in her eyes and didn&#39;t feel sick. Stated she felt fatigued like she want to take a nap but didn&#39;t feel ill. Stated whatever was going on was zapping her energy. Stated she woke up on day 4 (11Apr2021) in the middle of the night and her lungs were pinching, pinching, pinching, like an asthma attack and she couldn&#39;t stop it and she had to get her old fashioned inhaler to stop it. Stated this hadn&#39;t happened and she had been taking the special medication for 3 weeks now and it was very rare for her to get those attacks and this was worse than any. Patient relayed that today all day even with the special medication to open her lungs she can feel in her lungs that they were, she can&#39;t explain it, like they are gripping and releasing and gripping and releasing a little but. Stated she knew she was having some kind of asthma thing going on, it was not making her cough it was making her lungs hypersensitive. Stated she was expecting everything and she did read and nobody had symptoms that last more than 7 days and she was expecting them to be gone tomorrow, or she hopeed anyways. Stated the last 10 days had been easy-peasy and all of a sudden she was waking with all that coughing like something was irritating her lungs and she can&#39;t stop. Patient provided that it woke her husband up with her coughing for half an hour. States this lasted half an hour and was more than normal and something really irritated her lungs, shouldn&#39;t have happened as she is on the other thing every day and has not had an attack with that. Patient stated her provider didn&#39;t know as it was so relatively minor and was unusual but minor and she did not feel like it was life threatening. Stated her brother had Covid and she did not feel like she was trying to breathe and couldn&#39;t, or suffocating and dying. She did not feel that. The air irritated to even breathe and made her cough and couldn&#39;t stop and that was the first time she had to use an inhaler on top of on inhaler and something made her lungs respond to nothing there. Stated it may be her immune system thinking something was there, the headless thing in her lungs. Patient stated she thought she was over it and then got the fever not understanding if the fever was Covid related and she stayed at home and didn&#39;t go out until yesterday it was the 1st day out since Thursday and how could she have caught anything if she wasn&#39;t near anybody. Stated these were just thoughts in her head.

Additional Context: She had her first shot three weeks ago tomorrow. She is scheduled to get second one tomorrow. She was sick for 13 days after the first one. She was so sick. The headache was so bad the doctor sent her for a CT scan of her head. The headache was at the crown of the head and down into the back of the head. She never had a headache in the back of her head like that before. Her doctor wanted to make sure no bleed. It started lightly for two days and got worse and worse. It was 13 days before it went away. On top of that she had muscle aches in the beginning, but those went away. She was exhausted. She has already sent this in to Pfizer. She is questioning if she should get the second dose. She did get a COVID test and that was negative. She has done what she was supposed to do. Reference Number: she doesn&#39;t have a reference number. She has been on hold for two hours. She held because she feels this is very important. She really don&#39;t want to end up in trouble because she gets the second vaccine. Her doctor said it is a tough call. When she has to go get a shot and walk in with an EpiPen it gives her an ugly feeling. Her doctor is really not thrilled. She is darned if she does and darned if she doesn&#39;t. She knows one lady that died two days later and another one that died a couple of days later. They were both in another place. One was the wife of a surgeon. She thinks it has been reported. One was a community leader. They are waiting on the autopsies. Caller declined to proceed with a report for the two women that died after receiving the COVID vaccine. One died in the bathroom on the second day. The other is a doctor&#39;s wife and she passed one to two days after the shot. Neither was expected. Caller doesn&#39;t have their health records. She doesn&#39;t live in the same town. She is sure they are aware at Pfizer that this happened. She can&#39;t find anything. She didn&#39;t get a reference number from Pfizer. She gave the lot number when she reported it before because she remembered she had to get the card. She also reported it through (name). (name) gave her a confirmation number of ## on 13Mar2021. She think she would have filed them at the same time, so she probably reported it to Pfizer on 13Mar2021. Caller is going to delay the second shot. She knows she has up to 42 days. to get it.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Lot  EJ1686, intramuscular in right deltoid on 03Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient did not receive other vaccine within four weeks.  On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced sore arm and tiredness.  On 07Jan2021 the patient experienced anterior cervical fusion and was hospitalized from 07Jan2021 to 09Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced nausea. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced muscle aches, loss of taste and loss of smell. On unknown date the patient experienced headache. The patient was tested positive to COVID-19 on 11Jan2021. The patient did not visit Physician Office or Emergency Room. Laboratory data included COVID-19 Rapid Test positive on 11Jan2021. The outcome of the events tested positive for COVID-19, and anterior cervical fusion was unknown. The outcome of the events sore arm, tiredness, nausea, muscle aches, headache was resolving. The outcome of the events loss of taste, loss of smell was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 03Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 11Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  This 69-year-old female had medical history of ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The reported anterior cervical fusion was most likely due to concurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the vaccine of BNT162B2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I knew there was potential for side effects before taking the vaccine...I was totally unprepared for so many symptoms and how intense they were and what little I could do to relieve any of them. Never had fever that I am aware of. Today I?m weak and sweating is unreal.  ?? Should I prepare/expect my second dose around Feb. 14 to have the same effect on me.? Not looking forward to that. I was almost ready to go to the ER I was getting so dehydrated and weak.

                                                Two days (Friday) after the injection (Wednesday) a pain arose in my shoulder muscle on my left side just behind the injection site.  By Sunday afternoon the pain became debilitating and the pain spread to my underarm and the edge of the breast area. I applied heat and rested.  The sharp pain interfered with sleep and regular life activities.  On Tuesday morning I applied an ice pack, which relieved the pain.  After applying ice for two more times, the pain subsided and the swelling under my arm disappeared. I was able to resume normal activities with slight discomfort.

So then i left it alone because I didn&#39;t now if that was part of a reaction. When i got home i still had the odor in my mouth. i drank cold water and it went away. I waited. I felt sore on my arm but it wasn&#39;t that bad but as the hours went on it started getting more sore and painful. My arm was sore up to my shoulder and the back. After that the pain started traveling towards to my chest and i started getting pain in my chest. i took Tylenol (1 500 mg extra strength at 11:15 PM). So i waited 15 minutes to go to sleep. i got up the next day and everything was the same, i started putting ice on it and gave it time. I took another Tylenol but the pain was in my chest again a little bit. The third day the pain didn&#39;t come back in my chest and from then i was alright. I also started getting an itch.

                                                I give the girl in front of me the Covid vaccine way high on her arm. I told MA do not give my shot that high up. She said in a snide voice it?s still the deltoid and she shot my bursa. The evening of the shot I started having severe arm pain and nausea. The next morning I had right scapula rib pain it was hard to breathe my arm hurt very bad I can hardly lift it I went to work. When I got to work I couldn?t function I was so nauseated with the pain I went home that day and I?ve missed three days total from that event of wrong injection site. The pain has gotten worse I can?t lift my arm left right upper down without pain and it?s going into my neck and down to my elbow now I went to the occupational medical doctor. I told him what happened and he said she gave me the shot am I supraspinatus Bursa and I have an injury to my bursa. I came back for a second visit the next week and he said I have bursitis from that now I can?t raise and use my arm that well at all and I have severe pain 24 seven still and he sent me to a physical therapist starting today 2 to 21. It has gotten worse and my shoulder has locked up three times. I still have ongoing pain 24 seven and I want to report a complaint against the girl who gave my shot I thought she was an LPN but she is a MA.  We both work at healthcare clinic. I am a 26 year RN and she did not listen to me and she stuck me anyway against my will.

                                                Started within 2 hours of vaccine (8 pm) an extremely sore arm.  Then the pain started to radiate to my shoulder.  By the next day, it was really painful in my shoulder and across my back almost to my backbone.  It was painful to move my arm up or down or to reach for things. This lasted 3 to 4 days.  Then my neck on the same side as the shot (left) began to hurt so badly I couldn&#39;t move my neck up or down or sideways.  It was strange the way the pain slowly moved across by arm to my shoulder to my back and up my neck.  I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this before.   Today my pain in my neck is bearable but I have soreness and a headache.  I hope I am at the end of the cycle to this event as I am scheduled for my next shot soon.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in the left shoulder area on 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included COPD (has it for lots of years) and nickel sensitivity. She does not have any reactions to her previous unspecified vaccines but had a normal reaction like sore arm. Concomitant medication included bimatoprost (LUMIGAN).  The patient previously received flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine, both for immunization in 2020 around the end of Sep or beginning of Oct. The patient reported side effects regarding the COVID vaccine and said she was a little confused and unsure if she was having a problem or if she should see a doctor. On 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM, she had the first dose of the COVID vaccine and afterward she had a lot of effects which were mostly muscle and body aches in Jan2021. She also experienced some ongoing congestion in one nostril but saw this as just more congestion and that she was having to blow her nose more in Jan2021. She did the (app name) report but didn&#39;t report the stuffiness. She did report that in the first few days she felt like she was having the onset of pneumonia and felt tired and run down (Jan2021). Two days ago, she started feeling itchy (Jan2021) and she didn&#39;t know what it was, she didn&#39;t know if she ate something or what. Now she has developed a rash (Jan2021) which is ongoing until now. Her paperwork said the rash would happen right away if it was caused by the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if this is something she should be concerned about and if the rash could appear or started this long after she had the vaccine. Her second dose is due on 06Feb2021. The patient wanted to know if the vaccine contains nickel or any metal substances in it since she had compared her rash to her nickel sensitivity. The patient wanted to know if rash is a side effect from the vaccine and how long it will last. She didn&#39;t put rash down for the safety check either as she didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine. Today her rash, she is so itchy. She does have it on her neck and certain areas but not everywhere. It looks like what would happen after a bad fever. It is not raised but is like a fever type rash.  She did note that she had an increase dose of a medication eye drops (Lumigan; Lot: T and a 0 or O followed by 544, and NDC: 0023320503. Expiry: Jan2022) around the time the rash started but after getting the vaccine. Her head, neck and back are very itchy. She mentioned that she waited 2 days and did not put this event in the (app name). She would have reported it yesterday, but she didn&#39;t get one yesterday. She also noted that it was very dry there and cold and a person is going to get dry skin.  She does have an allergic to metal and wondered if that was in the product. In her neck area, it looks just like when she would wear a cheap necklace. No treatments received. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit.  The patient has no prior vaccination within four weeks. The patient had not yet recovered from events rash/like a fever type rash and congestion in one nostril/stuffiness; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.

Hopefully, I&#39;ll feel like myself within a few days.

This consumer was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Jan2021 14:30 with immunosuppressant mesalamine. The night of 14Jan2021 patient had headache, chills, body aches, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and dizziness like Covid 19 symptoms. She went to the ER during the past 11 days for IV fluids due to deyhydration from the diarrhea. Today, 25Jan2021 is the first day she has been out of the house, except to go to the ER, since she received her 1st vaccine dose. On Jan2021 muscle pain, neck ache, backache, problems with balance and problems with walking. Events probably started with intense diarrhea starting 14Jan2021; then Fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit and chills 14Jan2021; Specific onset dates and onset times unknown otherwise other than between 14Jan2021 and 16Jan2021 onset dates. It was a rolling week of agony after that with one adverse event after another until she ended up in the emergency room on 16Jan2021 because she was so dehydrated and was really sick. She was not admitted to the hospital related to any of these events; but while in the emergency room she was given intravenous fluids; a chest x-ray; blood work; after maybe 5-6 hours she was sent home; she was also given a COVID test which was negative; and then 2 days later took another COVID test which was also negative. Both COVID tests were Rapid Tests: on 16Jan2021 and 18Jan2021. On the Chest xray they suggested she had some sinus tachycardia which is just a rapid heartbeat and not surprising; nothing else showed up on Chest x-ray; as far as anything else testing/results wise there was only some facetious blood work which they just said to follow-up with her PCP regarding but nothing really out of the ordinary. She can finally out of bed on a regular basis for a couple of hours daily; she is still very fatigued; she has no muscle pain, neck aches or body aches at this time; she does not have the strength she should have; is no longer experiencing headaches or fever; but is extremely tired. She will fall asleep through the day for 3-4 hours at a time and she does not even nap usually (Jan2021). She has not driven yet but assumes probably once she is a little stronger she will be able to drive again. She did not have upper respiratory, chest or cough issues. The outcome of the events fever, headache, body ache, muscle pain, neck ache was recovered on Jan2021; fatigue was not recovered. The outcome for the other events was unknown.

She said her wrist, elbows, fingers, hips, knees, every joint down to her ankles, hurt; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient; retired nurse) via a Pfizer-sponsored program.  A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right deltoid on 10Feb2021 at 12:35 PM (at age of 69 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a convention center. The patient&#39;s medical history included eczema from 24Dec2018 and ongoing, rosacea (developed Rosacea at 65 years old), and the patient also reported that she used to be 5&#39;4&#34; and she lost 2 inches. She said she had a bone density test recently and was told she is 5&#39;2&#34;. She said she objected to the measurement of 5&#39;2&#34;, so the nurse told her to stand as tall as she can, and then the nurse noted her height as 5&#39;2-1/2&#34;. There were no concomitant medications. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. On 12Feb2021, the patient experienced eczema flare up, skin red, her left anterior chest was burning and itchy, headache, skin pain, and &#34;joint pain that was so bad, she thought she was going to die. She said her wrist, elbows. fingers, hips, knees, every joint down to her ankles, hurt&#34;.  The patient said she received her first COVID-19 Vaccine on 10Feb2021. She said everything was fine after she received her COVID-19 Vaccine. She didn&#39;t even have a mark on her arm where she received the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient reported that she got the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 10Feb2021 and is due to the second dose on 03Mar2021. Approximately 2 and half days later she got an eczema flare that was quite severe out of the blue since she was having eczema diagnosed since she was 67 (as reported; she is 69 today). She still has some itching and burning and she wondered if this was something that has been reported also for other psoriasis/eczema patients. She was concerned about taking the second dose since she thinks this may be caused by the vaccine as she stated that nothing has changed in her life aside the vaccination. The patient reported she takes tacrolimus for the treatment of her eczema. Also she said that she had some joint pain for a couple of days. She said 2-1/2 days later (Friday, 12Feb2021), out of the blue, she had an eczema flare up. She said she was diagnosed with eczema at 67 years old. She said Friday night (12Feb2021) into Saturday (13Feb2021) her left anterior chest was burning and itchy. She clarified her skin was really red and angry looking, and painful. She said she has not had any pain with her eczema in a long time. She said she took topical ointments and medication for the eczema flare up. She said she was surprised at the intensity of her eczema flare up. She clarified her initial diagnosis for eczema was on her left anterior chest and bra strap area, and arms. She said she has never had eczema on her face or any other part of her body. She said she was totally asymptomatic prior to getting her first COVID-19 Vaccine. She said on early Friday evening (12Feb2021) she ended up with joint pain that was so bad, she thought she was going to die. She said her wrist, elbows, fingers, hips, knees, every joint down to her ankles, hurt. She said she had a headache. She said by Sunday (14Feb2021) her joint pain and headache were gone. She said her symptoms went away so quickly. The patient asked if people reported a flare up with psoriasis or eczema after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine and if should she have any concerns about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot on 03Mar2021. The patient her eczema treatment included a combination of oral and topical medications. She clarified she used more of the prescription topical lotion than the over-the-counter oral medications. She received Famotidine 10mg (clarified as Pepcid AC; NDC Number: 11673-031-65, Lot Number:  OFE2821, Expiration Date: Feb2022). Her doctor told her she could take up to 20mg of Famotidine if her symptoms were bad. She said on Friday (12Feb2021) and Saturday (13Feb2021) she took 20mg of the Famotidine until she felt her symptoms were under control. The patient also received cetirizine 10 mg (reported as generic Zyrtec; NDC Number: 11673-502-87, Lot Number: 8ME2877A, Expiration Date: Sep2022). The patient reported that she took 20mg of the generic Zyrtec for the itching. She said her doctor told her she can take up to 20mg of the generic Zyrtec, if needed for itching. She said otherwise, she would normally take 10mg generic Zyrtec, as needed. The patient also received Tacrolimus Ointment 0.1% (Protopic Ointment; NDC Number: 0168-0416-30, Lot Number: JZ8459, Expiration Date: Apr2021), applied to affected areas twice a day and Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream, 0.1% (she stated she refers to it as &#34;TAC&#34; Cream; NDC Number: 67877-251-80, Lot Number: Y064, Expiration Date: Oct2022). The patient reported that she uses the &#34;TAC&#34; Cream under her breasts where her bra sits because the &#34;TAC&#34; Cream is less expensive than the Tacrolimus Ointment 0.1%. She said she uses the &#34;TAC&#34; Cream as needed, and the &#34;TAC&#34; Cream keeps her skin hydrated. She said she used the Protopic Ointment (Tacrolimus Ointment 0.1%) on Friday (12Feb2021), and then switched to the &#34;TAC&#34; Cream. The patient has had no itching or pain since early Monday (15Feb2021). Her joint pain and headache treatment included Advil Liquid Gel 200mg (UPC Number: 305730169080, Lot Number: 56264, Expiration Date: Jun2023). She said she took a couple Advil Liquid Gels on Friday (12Feb2021). The patient reported that she switched from Tylenol to Motrin because the Motrin worked well. She clarified she meant Ibuprofen when she said Motrin. She said she calls everything Motrin when she is referring to Ibuprofen. She said she took Tylenol occasionally and never felt the Tylenol worked. She said she hasn&#39;t taken Tylenol in a long time. She said Tylenol didn&#39;t work as well as the NSAIDs. She did not have the Tylenol NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. The patient reported that she takes Bufferin Brand Aspirin normally for pain. She said she sees someone who treats her holistically, and that person recommended the Bufferin Aspirin because it was not as damaging to the body. She said since the Bufferin Aspirin takes longer to work, she took the Advil Liquid Gel for faster pain relief.  No further details provided. The events eczema flare up, skin burning sensation, skin red, skin pain, joint pain, and headache were reported as serious - medically significant. The patient reported that she felt her symptoms were medically significant because her eczema flare up was so different from what she has ever experienced before. She said nothing had changed in her routine, and she has been in control of her eczema. She said she has had only very minor eczema flare ups. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and to physician office. The outcome of the events eczema flare up and skin red was recovering. The outcome of the events headache and joint pain was recovered on 14Feb2021. The outcome of the events skin burning sensation, skin pain, and itchy skin was recovered on 15Feb2021.

                                                Around 1 am woke with chills, myalgia, fever to 100.5. Didn&#39;t take anti-pyretic. Slept on and off. At around 3am woke up. Walked to bathroom to urinate. Stood up, started severe nausea and retching. The next thing I remember is finding myself on the ground in the bathroom, retching into the shower area. Called my husband (we are both physicians). My shirt was completely drenched. I was unable to stand up for 5-10 minutes. He noted a 6&#34; hole in the wall (completely through the sheetrock) behind me. I had no memory (and still don&#39;t) or falling or hitting my head. He walked me back to bed. My BP was 110/65, pulse was around 70, pulse ox was normal. Continued retching not as severe.  Took one Zofran. Eventually fell asleep. In the morning noticed a painful area at the left posterior part of my scalp. There were flakes of sheetrock there. The next day I was tired, felt slightly off balance, otherwise ok. Feeling of vague fuzziness, off-balance continued for a few days, then resolved.

                                                I&#39;m not sure this was from the vaccine, but it seems like the only likely cause: I had Pfizer Shot#2 on 2/23/21. I was feeling great for an entire week. Then, a week after the second shot, I got the worst fatigue I can ever remember, except maybe when I was pregnant, starting the evening of March 1. When I awoke on March 2, my body aches were so intense, I felt like I couldn&#39;t move out of bed. Then during the day, I tried to take my usual outdoor walk - usually ~ 5 miles/day. I had to turn around part-way because I was so exhausted and my legs felt both like concrete and like they were quaking from tiredness. Later that afternoon, I  fell asleep sitting up in my chair SIX times, even though I almost NEVER take a nap! I kept doubting myself because I haven&#39;t read about delayed onset of symptoms, but we don&#39;t go anywhere indoors at all except for getting the shot at the pharmacy and an MD clinic appointment now and then. (I did have an annual MD appointment on March 2, so was in the clinic that very day, using all precautions. I don&#39;t imagine I could have gotten ill instantly from something at the clinic though?) In ensuing days, I continued to feel super-fatigued, but have had more energy each day, to the point where, now, 6 days later, I feel &#34;almost&#34; like myself. I&#39;m still unsure of walking the full 5 miles without getting too tired, and certain body aches are still hanging on (knee, wrists, fingers), but I&#39;m otherwise feeling good. If I had the symptoms right after the shot, I would have been sure it was from the shot, but since it was delayed a week, I was uneasy and it felt a bit scary because I felt so unlike my healthy, spry, active, motivated self.   One other odd thing, that may be totally unrelated, but just in case - on the very day of the second shot, I got a huge stye on my left eye - something I haven&#39;t had in decades. It has still not gone away after 2 weeks. Just in case you get other reports, I am letting you know about this as well. The fatigue and body aches sound a lot like what is to be expected after the shot, but I do know there have been some eye-related issues as well.

                                                My second COVID-19 vaccination injection on Friday morning, 2/19/2021 resulted initially (starting on Saturday, the day following the vaccination} in a sore right wrist and a much more painful right arm that steadily grew in intensity and spread rather rapidly into my upper torso.  By the following day (Sunday, 2/21) my breasts became very sensitive and I had severe pains across my back.  This may or may not have been the beginning of a banding type MS exacerbation, but by Monday, 2/22, it was clear that I was experiencing a full-blown and seriously disabling exacerbation. Both legs experienced the tingling and numbness I have had in a prior exacerbation, and by the time I was able to talk to Dr. (my neurologist) on Monday afternoon (2/22), the numbness had progressed upward into my lower abdomen and I was no longer able to stand at all.  It appears highly likely that the MS attack was triggered by the response of my immune system&#39;s reacting to the discomfort and severe body pains that occurred following the vaccination.  I told Dr. of the total loss of feeling and use of both legs and was experiencing a increasing numbness from toes up to abdomen.  Before ordering the high doses of corticosteroids used to stop my exacerbation, Dr. sent me to the Emergency Room for testing to make sure I did not have an infection that could be covered up by the steroids.  When this testing did not show any such infection, the ER administered an IV infusion of 1 gram of solumedrol, followed by gradually decreasing high oral doses of prednisone.  As of this date, numbness has started decreasing and some limited  utility of right leg has returned.  Still i can no longer stand and perform even the minimal movements to-and-from wheelchair to bed or toilet without substantial physical help (not needed before this exacerbation) from my sole caregiver, my husband.

                                                Very sore arm starting about 4 ours post injection.  Couldn&#39;t raise it above shoulder level.  Felt very thick and heavy.  Throbbing.  Pulsating, as though I could feel my heartbeat in my arm when I went to bed.  Took to Tylenol or sleep would have been impossible.  Woke up to a less painful arm and it improved throughout day feeling almost normal by bedtime 24 hours later.  Took 2 Tylenol to ensure sleep.  Woke up Tuesday morning and arm felt almost 2100% normal.  I thought, wow, that wasn&#39;t so bad.  BUT I WAS WRONG.  Tuesday mid morning, I began to feel what I would describe as jittery.  Around 11:00 am a wave of nausea washed over me and subsided.  I thought maybe I needed to eat as I hadn&#39;t yet so I had lunch.  After lunch I began to feel nauseous again and like diarrhea was coming.  After going to the bathroom, the nausea started building again,  and the diarrhea recurred, and the nausea heightened.  By mid afternoon I was on the floor hugging the toilet bowl wanting to vomit, waiting to vomit, groaning.  It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve had nausea or vomiting and the whole experience was unexpected from what I read about possible reactions.  I wondered if it was food poisoning but my husband and I had eaten the same thing and he was fine.  Finally about 3:30-4:00, 48 ours post vaccine, I threw up multiple times, perhaps 5 times.    After about 4:30 pm it was over.  I was worried that if I ate again I&#39;d be sick so I only drank decaf tea.  I felt exhausted from the ordeal but very wired and jittery too.  I crawled into bed hoping for sleep.  No luck.  At 3:00 am I was still watching the clock and shocked that I couldn&#39;t sleep.  I had to get up at 6:30 in the morning due to some construction at our home.  I was legit exhausted Wednesday.  I no recurrence of the nausea or diarrhea after the bout on Tuesday afternoon.  I ate modestly but normally on Wednesday and slept normally Wednesday night.    Nothing more to report, although I read that up to a week later some people experienced a reaction so I wanted to give it a week to see if anything else would happen.  Nothing else to report.

                                                Shoulder was a little sore; Arm soreness; itchiness, a rash, and a big area of redness on her left arm which was the injection arm; itchiness, a rash, and a big area of redness on her left arm which was the injection arm; itchiness, a rash, and a big area of redness on her left arm which was the injection arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 69-year-old female patient (wife) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number reported as &#34;ELI283 or EL1283&#34;), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure (abnormal) and cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medications included blood pressure medication and cholesterol. The consumer was reporting on behalf of his 69 year old wife. She received the first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine on 30Jan2021. On 06Feb2021, she started to experience itchiness, a rash, and a big area of redness on her left arm which was the injection arm. He stated he heard that the second dose can cause more side effects and he stated they both experienced arm soreness after the first dose on an unspecified date. Consumer stated, first of all thank you guys for making this vaccine. He and his wife received the vaccine (unspecified vaccine) their first dose last Saturday, a week ago yesterday and had no reaction to it at all, their shoulder was a little sore but that&#39;s it. Yesterday night, last night his wife noticed that the arm where she had the vaccination it has like a rash and he knows this online that Moderna has something called COVID arm but it doesn&#39;t say anything about Pfizer. He meant it&#39;s not to bother it itches a little bit you put some anti-itch cream on it wasn&#39;t a big deal. He was kind of concerned about the next you know they got the next one coming on the 18th, so, does she should change arm, do it on the other arm. Consumer added that that would be fine, he knows you guys want to know if there was any reaction so that you can log it in and that was basically why he called. They were going for their next shot they were going to the hospital and there were professionals there so pretty much ask them what they should do. Should they change arm or nothing to worry about if they do it again that was not the problem he just wanted to let you guys know that there was some kind of reaction a rash. Consumer stated he just put Cortaid cream on it and itch went away. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lab work on 27Jan2021: doctor did for cholesterol, blood pressure reasons and everything was fine. The outcome was recovered for the event itchiness; and unknown for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021170691 same reporter and drug, similar events, different patient

                                                I had the normal headache, fatigue, and joint pain in my knees with the first and second dosage of Pfizer.  But something different occurred after the second dosage.  I experience knee pain daily from surgery a few years ago.  My right knee is always a bit swollen and painful.  After the second dose of Pfizer, I experienced shooting pains in my knees, especially the right knee.  This pain was unlike anything I had ever experienced before.  It was almost like a hot poker was intermittandly being held to my knee, and a sensation radiated down my leg.  It sensationn occurred the evening after the shot was administered, and lasted only that evening.  After this experience, I can report that the swelling and pain in my knee has drastically reduced.  I feel that the inflammation in my right knee has noticeably decreased, and the swelling has almost completely subsided.

It is not covid but cough of long-standing.  The next day I had sore arm,  muscle pains, cold body temperature (97.1 F), and wheezing.  Wheezing was new and it hurt and worried me.  Intense fatigue.  Wheezing has resolved but the rest still there and it is 11 days since vaccine

                                                1.DOSE #1:  EXPERIENCED TINNITUS IN BOTH EARS FOR FOUR EVENINGS IN SUCCESSION FROM TUESDAY, MARCH 2 THROUGH FRIDAY MARCH 5. THE TINNITUS   SUBSIDED GRADUALLY OVER THE NEXT 2 WEEKS (APPROXIMATELY).  I AM NOT CURRENTLY, AS OF THIS DATE (MARCH 25) , EXPERIENCING THIS.  ASIDE FROM A MINOR SORENESS TO MY ARM LASTING LESS THAN 30 MINUTES, I COULD NOT &#39;FEEL&#39; THIS INJECTION AND  HAD NO OTHER ISSUES FOLLOWING THE VACCINE DOSE #1 UNTIL THE FOLLOWING: 2. DOSE #2: AT ABOUT 9:30 AM ON MONDAY, MARCH 22.  THE INJECTION (LEFT ARM, AGAIN) WAS, IN COMPARISON TO THE FIRST &#39;JAB&#39;, CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT THIS DID NOT CONCERN ME.  HOWEVER, ON MY DRIVE HOME (ABOUT 20 MINUTES) MY ARM GRADUALLY BECAME VERY SORE, AND CONTINUED TO BE PAINFUL AND GET WORSE OVER THE FOLLOWING HOURS.  I COULD NOT USE OR LIFT MY LEFT ARM WITH SIGNIFICANT PAIN NOT ALEVIATED BY IBUPROFEN (3 TO  4 AT A TIME).  THIS CONTINUED THROUGH WEDNESDAY, MARCH 24 AT WHICH TIME I TOOK ONE (1) TYLENOL AND ONE (1) IBUPROFEN, AND THAT HELPED WITH THE ACHE.  AS OF THURSDAY, MARCH 25 (WHEN I AM RECORDING THIS) IT  IS LESS PAINFUL, AND I AM ABLE TO LIFT THE LEFT ARM WITH LESS DISCOMFORT.   MY SHOULDER SOCKET ALSO SEEMS TO BE LESS PAINFUL.  I AM SENDING THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE I READ THAT TINNITUS HAS BEEN EXPERIENCE BY A SMALL GROUP OF VACCINE RECIPIENTS, AND BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED THAT PERSONS THE EXPERIENCE WAS MORE THE WAY THE VACCINE WAS INJECTED (MAYBE NOT IN THE CORRECT LOCATION).  I HAVE NOT FELT THE NEED TO SEE A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER HEALTH PROVIDER.  I HAVE CHANGED MY insurance AND AM REVIEWING NEW PROVIDERS.

On the first day after the second dose (Tuesday, March 16, 2021), I slept 19 hours, sat up for 1 hour, and went back to bed and slept another 16 hours. Upon waking on the second day after the vaccination (Wednesday, March 17, 2021), the fever had broken and the aches were not as severe but still present. No food or drink were consumed as I slept the entire time. On the third day after the vaccination (Thursday, March 18, 2021), aches were gone, but I was so weak with little energy. In addition, I had lost 3.5 pounds since the day of the vaccination. I could not find a thermometer (as well as was too tired to look), so I cannot tell you what my temperature was, but my face/forehead was hot to the touch.

                                                Couple of days after first Vaccine my left leg just above my ankle on underneath the skin it felt like the blood getting very hot and feverish for a few minutes then go away for awhile then do it again and happening constantly.  Then  in my 3rd week it jumped to middle of leg and then up to lower knee (all left leg), then go back down to ankle.   It just feels like hot blood under the skin.   I then called my primary doctor and they had me do in as I was concerned it could be a blood clot, but he checked and assured me it wasn&#39;t.  Dr. said they have been seeing patients with same issue I am having, having the Pfizer shots but those people have in both legs or both arms and  he really couldn&#39;t give me a answer but to report to CDC.   He said to proceed with second shot which I did and still having same issue.   I called my primary doctor back again this week as this continues with &#34;Hot Spots&#34; and I was experiencing numbness in two small toes on left leg and next 2 toes tingling and concerned for these  &#34;Hot Spots&#34; (no rashes).   He is now setting me up  for a sonogram to reassure me it isn&#39;t a blood clot.      I was never sick with the shot, just minor soreness in arm for following day and tired on first round.  Called me a prescription in for Gabapentin 300mg.

                                                This is a 70 year old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (anticoagualted on Eliquis), obstructive sleep apnea (uses CPAP), mitral valve regurgitation, remote tobacco use, hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents to the ED for worsening dyspnea, cough, subjective fever, chills and body aches that have been ongoing for the past several days.

                                                I initially had 2 days or so of feeling very ill. Then ok for 5 days.  Then second round of reaction started.  Intense pain and swelling of right side of neck for 3 days. Also left wrist unable to use.  Pale, ill.  Vital signs ok.  Then on 3/8, pain switched to left side of neck and upper back. 3/10, right neck again with swollen lymph nodes bilateral.   3/11 back of neck and upper back hurts.  Intense.  Could not sleep. 3/12 pain in upper quads and hips, mid pack.  Feeling freezing cold.  Temp ok.  Called my Dr.  Right side of neck continued to hurts even now (3/28/2021) but at least I can function now.  I no longer feel sick, brain fog, cold.  So greatly improved but not normal.  Reaction has lasted a month.  Vaccine number one resulted in 2 days feeling ill with upper back pain, chills but only a few days.  First night vomited, passed out.  First vaccine reaction was frightening but was short lived.  I am a retired RN.

                                                excruciating low lumbar pain from L5 and S; Was unable to walk and sit; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse(patient). The 69-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in left arm on 13Mar2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6204) as single dose for precautionary for getting covid 19. Medical history included severe asthma, she had lumbar fusion T9-L5. Her lumbar back area was the worst area on her body even before she got the Covid vaccine. She had been in pain all the time 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There were no concomitant medications. On 14Mar2021 morning, she was unable to walk and sit, experiencing excruciating low lumbar pain from L5 and S. It continued all day, pain excruciated was screaming and crying until yesterday afternoon went to the hospital. She had not experienced pain ever like this. If she got up to use the bathroom, it was pain, excruciating pain the whole time she&#39;s up. The hospital didn&#39;t admit her because she did an MRI with contrast and without contrast and it showed no changes from her last MRI in Nov2020. She was still in severe pain. Doctor in the emergency room gave her 2 IV push of hydromorphone hydrochloride (DILAUDID) and did nothing. There was no pain as long as she&#39;s not moving but when she got up or move or go to the washroom to urinate has excruciating pain. She was supposed to get on the plane tomorrow not able to get out of bed. Pain was localized in one area like stabbing burning and excruciating pain if moving. It&#39;s not like a muscle or joint pain you get from a flu vaccine. She was prescribed Oxycodone 5/325 from the emergency room. She didn&#39;t take any oxycodone last night, she was hesitant to take pain meds. She was laying prone in bed except to get up to restroom, her husband gave her one of the oxycodone before he left for work this morning. It was unknown if the oxycodone was working, since she hadn&#39;t moved yet, she&#39;s laying prone and had not moved to the right or to the left and she just took it about 45 minutes ago. Lab data also included blood work, MRI with and without contrast, Covid test, with unknown results. Seriousness criteria for events was disability. Outcome of events was not recovered. She asked the emergency room doctor could this be related to the Covid vaccine and the doctor would not state whether he thought it was or was not. She&#39;s thinking it was related because it is so new and it&#39;s the only thing new that&#39;s been introduced into her body. Relatedness of drug to reactions by reporter was related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported excruciating low lumbar pain from L5, which resulted unable to walk and sit,  and the administration of the COVID19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

                                                On 3/24, I woke up nauseous, extremely fatigued, with sore joints, headache, and abdominal pain.  A few days later I noticed I had extreme shortness of breath.  I went to see my PCP on or about 3/31.  He listened to my heart and discovered a rapid heartbeat.  He then took an EKG.  He wanted to put me on lifetime meds immediately.  I was in shock because I truly believe this is a reaction to the COVID vaccine.  I have never had arrhythmia.  In fact, I had a wellness visit with the Dr. about 3 months previously and all was good.  I have been seeing him for four years since I moved.  He does not think my new diagnosis is related to a vaccine reaction, but I find it highly suspect that 4 other women in my large circle of friends also have AFIB after 2nd shot. I spent Easter in the ER and they pumped Metoprolol in my bloodstream.  I did not stay in the hospital that night.  I went to see the Dr. on Monday morning on 4/4.  He prescribed Metroprolol 25 mg and Xarelto 20 mg IMMEDIATELY.  I picked up the meds and started this regimen.  In speaking with other women, I believe this terrible diagnosis is a direct result as a reaction from the vaccine.

It was hard/where she got the injection; It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge.; Fever blister; heart beating so out of rhythm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing coeliac disease; hypothyroidism, is diabetic and has irregular heartbeat from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism; hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan medoxomil (OLMESARTAN/HCTZ MYLAN) taken for blood pressure measurement; metformin, glipizide and pioglitazone hcl taken for diabetes mellitus; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81) taken for thrombosis; metoprolol taken for heart rate irregular, cyanocobalamin (VIT B12) taken for an unspecified indication, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine, rosuvastatin, vitamin d2, vitamin d3 and potassium, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198, NDC: 59267-1000-1, expiry: unknown) on 27Feb2021 at 1:40PM for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn&#39;t get into them and she didn&#39;t want to go to the ER. She didn&#39;t have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn&#39;t able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of NT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 08:30 (Lot Number: ER8727; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021, at age of 69 years old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies: Penicillin, Ampicillin, hair color product. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She was allergic to Penicillin, and Ampicillin. As a child, always reacted strongly to any vaccination she was given with a fever and flu like symptoms for a couple of days. With Ampicillin, she thought she was having a heart attack. Was told to stop Ampicillin immediately because she could get a heart attack. This was when she was 25 years old and she never went to the ER. She was allergic to a hair color product in the 1990s and it made her scalp itch really badly. Was given a cortisone shot, which she reacted immediately breaking out head to toe in hives. Has no NDC/LOT/EXP for the vaccinations she reacted strongly to as a child. Stated this was in the 1950s or early 1960s. Clarified she did not have a heart attack with Ampicillin, but it felt like she was having one. Has had cardiograms per her request and her heart and heart walls are perfect. The patient received the first dose of the Covid vaccine at 8:30 a.m. this morning on 26Mar2021. Caller reports around 11 a.m., she experienced excruciating leg cramping going from her buttock down behind her knee and rolling to the inside of her thigh, states that the pain lasted 15 minutes. The patient reports the same pain occurred on the opposite leg around noon and lasted for 15 minutes, states that &#34;the pain was so excruciating that she could barely stand up and it was so agonizing it was unbelievable.&#34; The patient noticed that the inside of her thighs were a little red on the side, both legs from her thighs to her knees. The patient states that she has not been in the sun, and didn&#39;t think it was anything alarming, but this is abnormal for her, states that she received the vaccine in the right arm and her upper torso is fine and her head is clear, asked if anyone else had reported this reaction. She was planned to received the second dose on 16thApr in the early afternoon. The patient stated the COVID shot was already fogging her mind. The patient felt pretty good after first shot. Felt nothing. Fifteen minutes before leaving the diner she got a leg cramp. Was sitting in a booth and didn&#39;t think much of it. Attributed it to the way she was sitting. Around 11AM when she got back to her garage, she was in agony. It hurt from the top of her rear all the way down the side to the back of her knee and rolled to the inside of her thigh. She was in such agony and didn&#39;t know if she could get out of her chair and walk. By the time she reached her apartment it has subsided. An hour later, same thing happened in the left leg. She was laying in bed and texting because she didn&#39;t&#39; know if she would get any other reaction. This leg cramp was even worse. She was in tears. Got off bed to try and walk it off. Initial leg cramp happened in right leg. Was excruciating. Both times it lasted for 15 minutes. Both cramps were from her buttocks, all down to her knees, and rolled over into her thigh. Didn&#39;t know if that was a reaction. It is not typical of anything written on Pfizer&#39;s information or that she had heard. She was concerned. Heard about blood clots, but not with this particular product. Stated second leg cramp subsided. If it hadn&#39;t, she wouldn&#39;t have gone to the ER. Leg cramps was so excruciating. Originally thought it was coincidental and stated she will be 70 on (Date withheld). To say she has never had leg cramps before would be a lie. The way the leg cramps were timed was kind of weird. It was absolutely the same kind of cramp and location just on the a different leg. Weight: Gained 25lbs. Doesn&#39;t have COVID or any symptoms. Tested three to four months ago and was negative. Received first dose COVID-19 Vaccine today, 26Mar2021, at 08:30AM. First leg cramp began 11:00AM in right leg. Second leg cramp began Noon in left leg. Each time lasted 15 minutes. Not having leg cramps right now. Could barely talk when having leg cramps. Was worried about getting clots in legs. Otherwise she would think it was because she was getting older. She doesn&#39;t get leg cramps very often. Doesn&#39;t know when the last time she had leg cramps prior to today. Nurse technician at vaccine faculty stated caller&#39;s allergy history wouldn&#39;t be a problem and she only had to sit for 15 minutes. Received the COVID-19 Vaccine and hardly felt it. Waited for 15 minutes. She was fine until 11AM. She was fine now, but her arm might get a little stiff tomorrow. Arm was slightly tender. Surprised she felt something in her legs. Doesn&#39;t know whether to associate it with COVID-19 Vaccine or not. Has nothing to complain about in the upper torso or from the waist up. Wants to know if this is a reaction or coincidence. Stated she expected to have a stiff arm. The outcome of the event &#34;Cramps in legs&#34; and &#34;pain&#34; was recovered on 26Mar2021. The outcome of other events was unknown.

The outcome of the events rash, pain and cannot get out of bed/she could not stand up was unknown. The outcome of the events tenderness on the injection site was not recovered/not resolved.

                                                My reaction began typically enough, with a sore arm and chills.  The chills subsided by the evening, but symptoms continued and migrated from there.  The arm remained sore for 3 days and then began to itch.  This itchiness continued on and off for the next 2 days.  My neck and shoulder were also sore.  The shoulder continued to be sore for about 4 days.  I had an intermittent headache, also  for 4 days.  The worst part though, is the nausea, which also comes and goes.  But it can last for many hours and now, even after 8 days, I am still experiencing this.  I can find nothing in the writings about this vaccine to corroborate this side effect and I am therefore worried about the second shot.

                                                Unable to fall asleep the night of the second dose.  Felt progressively worse as night went on.  By 3am, had fever, chills, couldn&#39;t stop shaking or get warm, had headache, skin sensitive almost hurt when touched.  Felt too bad to get out of bed but eventually got up, took acetimetophen, drank water, added clothes and blankets and returned to bed.  Body kept tensing up very tightly so that all muscles were constricted/tights and impossible to relax.  This continued for a few hours.  By morning, I thought I was starting to feel better.  These symptoms returns for a second round about 2pm that afternoon and continued until about 6pm.  On the nights of 2/3, 2/4 and 2/5, I wake up around 3am extremely hot and sometimes damp, despite air temp of 66 to 68 degrees.  This resolves after about an hour and body feels normal.

But was symptomless for a while).  After about 18 to 20 hours after vaccination  experienced severe bilateral metatarsal pain and joint pain on knees and back.    Mild to moderate nasal congestion.  Took 1 gram APAP /Benadryl alternating with ASA 325mg  along with bedrest.   Over the course of 2 days the pain (myalgia and arthralgia), flu-like symptoms and congestion resolved.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  bnt162b2 (Lot/batch number and Expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 15Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. There were no concomitant medications and medical history. She had still has a sore throat, it has been a week since her first injection, and she immediately like got a sore throat straightaway, then drainage, and she was really tired and had to go to bed in about 4 hours. She couldn&#39;t stay awake 4 hours after, she went to bed and slept for 12 hours after the first shot. There was discharge from her nose, bloody, crusty like a cold, and she seldom ever has a cold and that continued, she didn&#39;t feel good until about maybe 4 or 5 days later. Sore throat was immediately after she thinks, it was certainly the next day (16Jan2021), and her date of vaccine was 15Jan2021. Now states and cough developed not until later. On 15Jan2021, she had the shot, she was really tired, muscle aches, the kind of things on the sheet, if not that evening, but the next day (16Jan2021), then drainage, it was white at first, it didn&#39;t turn yellow until a few days later, had a yellowish tinge, so she is sure there was inflammation, and her nose was crusty, in the morning it was a little bloody, and she had a sore throat, and probably by the Wednesday or Thursday, so 20 or 21Jan2021, there was a little cough, in the evening, and she is not experiencing that today. The outcome of the event sore throat was not recovered, cough was recovered on 22Jan2021, cold was recovering, other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at 10:40 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The relevant medical history included asthma, tremor (Tremors that runs on her mother&#39;s side of the family), neuropathy of hands and arms, high cholesterol, thyroid, neuropathy, vascular gait disorder, cervical stenosis operation from 2018. Concomitant medications included painkiller for neuropathy and unspecified medicines for high cholesterol, thyroid. She stated she received the first dose on 21Jan2021 and experienced tremors in her hands starting the following day. She stated that Friday her hands started shaking non-stop and had done that since then. She also reported having a sore arm. She had occasional tremors that didn&#39;t last very long. Since COVID-19 Vaccine had had nonstop shaking of hands since around Friday. Primary care doctor didn&#39;t treat her. Went to a pain center and neurologist. No further details provided. Tried to report online, but there were too many questions so she opted out. Does kind of get better if she is real still and lays down, but it still shakes. Never had this before. The patient stated that Friday or Saturday she didn&#39;t remember exactly when, sometimes they shake but not very long but this was like nonstop and it&#39;s a much more aggressive shaking. She hoped she could get the second one because she wanted the protection. She was not sure of her weight because she lost a bunch when she had surgery but she was about 115. When probed for treatment, she stated that it went away it was a day or so after but the hands were shaking and it&#39;s very intense shaking and it&#39;s going on and it&#39;s not stopping. She didn&#39;t have anything for it. It&#39;s never been like this before. The outcome of the event tremors in her hands/hands started shaking non-stop was not recovered, while other events were unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Reminded me of the pain one would experience getting a cortisone shot. Three to four hours later pain in shoulder was substantial. Unable to lift arm, at all.  Pain continued throughout the night. Twenty-four hours later some improvement in arm mobility and marked pain.  Forty-five hours later not yet at full mobility and with slight to moderate pain.  Feel more attention to vaccine injection site is needed.

                                                The  Vaccination Site is a drive thru site.  People roll down the car window and are vaccinated. I am very short. The person who was injecting the vaccine was very tall. My shoulder is below the window so he injected me in the shoulder, not in the muscle of my arm. As that is what was more exposed. He should have had me stand up or he should have opened the door to inject me in the shoulder.  It really hurt, and took quite a lot longer for him to inject than my first vaccination. He had to push hard to inject it.  The stinging snd pain was very different than the quick first shot I received three weeks earlier and the stinging lasted an hour.  I was concerned the vaccine was injected in my shoulder and sent a picture to my doctor. He confirmed it was injected in the rotator cuff. This may cause problems as reported on the CDC website as a warning to vaccinators. What do I do???

A 70-years-old female patient started to received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dystonia and migraines from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 antibody test positive from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medication for dystonia and migraines. The patient experienced a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; to her first dose of BNT162B2 in Feb2021. She had all-over body rash that was &#34;very red, like a tomato&#34; and showed up 35-40hours after her dose.  She states her doctor does not recommend she get the second dose. The patient meant by allergic reaction, she had a number of things, she experienced tiredness, injection site pain, joint muscle pain, she felt unwell, this all happened on the Saturday, the same day she got the vaccine on 13Feb2021. Then on Sunday 14Feb2021, all the symptoms she spoke about were still there and so she rested all day. On 15Feb2021, she looked at her elbows, clarifying the inside of elbow, her elbow creases, and on both elbow creases the skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen down to her thigh, it was working it&#39;s way down to the knee, the color was like a beet red, tomato color,  it was under the arms, started with elbow, was at her neck. The more down the redness spread, the more it red in color it also got. When she noticed this she called the doctor. When she called the doctor, the doctor said get over to the Emergency Room right away. Her husband and her were both on the phone and were telling the doctor that she doesn&#39;t want to go to hospital,  she asked if she can just come into the doctors office. The doctor said No. He told her that needs to get special lab work done, and he needs to send her information over to the ER. He said this could do possible damage to the kidneys. The doctor said lets not forget the last time she did a blood test, which was in Nov2020, at that time she came up positive with COVID antibodies. It could have been possible that she had COVID and was asymptomatic, or she had it. The doctor said that they need to do another COVID test or it could be she had a COVID cold or a cold with antibodies, her doctor doesn&#39;t know. The fact that she had that test that came back with COVID antibodies  test but not have COVID in Nov2020 was something to consider. He was concerned may be there is more to this, or just a rash. The doctor said that he is not equipped say what it should be. The doctor said he will speak with them at the hospital. Tiredness subsided yesterday afternoon on 15Feb2021, it subsided before she went to the ER visit. Right now, it&#39;s kind of like a lasting effect because she is not feeling normal. The injection site pain was still there but not as bad. The joint muscle pain subsided this afternoon around 1 o clock. It first began a half hour after leaving the stadium and she was experiencing it while driving back home, the pain continued and got worse. When she got up on Sunday morning her whole body was in pain, she was not getting better on Sunday and that&#39;s when she sat on couch rest of the day. For red skin, with the temperature of the skin, she didn&#39;t feel it to see if it was hot or anything, it was more this feeling that its just not going away getting worse, it didn&#39;t feel hot, there was no texture on the skin either. She just noticed she was flushed red. She called the doctor first, and he said that he was sending information to the emergency room. Then she went to (name of place withheld) ER. They took her temperature, there was no fever. She was then relieved from the ER in 2.5 hours and went home. She still has redness on the skin. In the hospital, they gave her 40 mg of prednisone and an injection or Benadryl, and prescription for prednisone to take for the next 4 days while tapering down. She did take Benadryl about 2 hours ago, she did notice all the sudden she was getting itchy. She is less itchy now. With the itchiness, she just observed this about 2 hours ago. She took Benadryl, she has somewhat improved, she is still itchy but not to the point that she will scratch heavily. She does not have her COVID CDC Card at the moment, her husband has that information but he is on a conference call with a client and she cant disturb him. The patient was scheduled for a second dose on 06Mar2021. That&#39;s where she has a question, the doctor is saying that he is not sure about getting second shot. They took lab work at the hospital and said everything was fine except for white blood cell count, it was on the lower side in Feb2021. She has had no vaccines on the same day or in the 4 weeks prior. She hasn&#39;t had any vaccines. She did have to visit the emergency room. She only called the doctors office, the doctor said not to come in and go tot he ER. She has No relevant family medical history that she would like to share. The severe allergic reaction, &#34;skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen&#34;, injection site pain, redness of the skin, itchiness, joint muscle pain and whole body was in pain was recovering. The event tiredness recovered with sequelae on 15Feb2021 and the event joint and muscle pain was recovered on 16Feb2021. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

This subsided in a few days. I was holding off on taking my Orencia infusions because I wasn&#39;t sure when I would be able to get the vaccine. Orencia dosing is every 4 weeks and I am supposed to take any vaccinations two weeks post infusion.  After my second vaccination, I had a full flare. Swollen joints, IBS symptoms, fatigue,fevers, decreased appetite.  I went to my rheumatologist and scheduled an infusion as soon as possible. I had to stop taking NSAIDs because my creatinine became abnormal. I had my Orencia 750mg on Februray 1, 2021, but continued to feel ill and started a prednisone

There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced knee pain after the first vaccine in 2021 and her orthopedic doctor recommended an oral steroid for 6 days. The patient had a knee procedure (unrelated to vaccine) and was prescribed methylprednisolone to address the pain. MRI on an unknown date with unknown results. The outcome of the event knee pain was unknown.  The consumer stated that the knee pain was unrelated to COVID vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event Arthralgia is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which may not be related to the suspected drug BNT162B2.  Knee procedure may provide an explanation for the event.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The possibility that suspect drug may have contributed to the reported event cannot be excluded.

                                                I woke up the morning after receiving the second Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, and the ball joint and toe of my left foot was swollen, red and painful. I ended up taking methylprednisolone (Medrol Dose Pac) for it. A few days after I completed that course of medication, I had another reaction where the left ankle did the same thing, got blood tests and the joint was aspirated; the doctor injected lidocaine and a corticosteroid into the joint, also the Medrol Pac meds again. Seems to be okay now. My doctor considers it a flare of inflammatory arthritis, auto-immune.

                                                Before vaccination I was experiencing slight  sciatica pain in right lower back and buttock.  The morning (6:00 am)after the vaccination I got up and could hardly walk because of excruciating pain in right lower back and buttock.  I started taking a muscle relaxant and Ibuprofen for the pain.  Some days were better than others and after a week I started feeling better with no pain.  I also had right wrist pain (I had surgery on my right wrist Dec/ 31, 2020 for a cyst removal.)  I had trouble moving my right wrist.  I still have some wrist pain, especially in the morning.  It subsides somewhat after using it during the day.  My lips started peeling a couple of days after the vaccination. I used a lip balm several times daily It took a week for my lips to return to normal.  I am feeling well now and am glad to have received the vaccination.

I called an ambulance at about 2:00 am on February 18, 2021, with severe pain on the left side of my face and left neck. The pain in my teeth felt like it was being drilled. I was nauseated and the ambulance people thought I was having a heart attack. My blood pressure is normally 110/65, but it was close to 200/104, I think they said. A few days later I went to another ER because the doctor thought I was having a stroke.

It was reported that the patient took a bath with Epsom Salt and it id not help. She got in bed by 8PM. Normally she goes to bed around 9:30-10 PM, but she was very tired. She then followed up and stated she went to sleep after the news about 10:20.  Then at 4:45 AM she woke up  because her eyes were very dry. Stated she has a humidifier in the apartment and usually has no trouble with her eyes, but they were very dry. She also noticed her ribs were hurting and it was noticeable on 11Feb2021. She was also more achy, but it the ribs hurting did not last real long. Then she noticed she was wheezing (11Feb2021). She knows she was wheezing because she has had pneumonia in the past and had wheezing then. The wheezing she had after the vaccine was not real bad. It stopped after about 10-15 minutes or so. She had laid down in bed for a while then got up around 5:30 AM. She felt better around then, but it took until like around 8AM before she felt fully okay as her arm was still aching. The outcome of the event arm started hurting and achy  was recovered on 12Feb2021; eyes dry, ribs hurting and wheezing recovered on 11Feb2021; thirst and muscular weakness recovered on 10Feb2021, and unknown outcome for the remaining events.

I mostly wanted to sleep. At first I did not associate the symptoms with the vaccine, but then realized it was probably associated. The fatigue and muscle aches lasted about 7 or 10 days.

In the ER, patient was afebrile and her exam noted: bilateral hand and wrist swelling (left&gt;right), but no redness or warmth at joints; full ROM, but pain increased with movements. Diagnosed as reactive arthritis and prescribed Tiger Balm and Lidocaine patches, with continued Ibuprofen recommended.  At follow-up appointment with patient&#39;s PCM on 29 Jan, she reported continued muscle and joint pains. She reported some relief with topical analgesics and Ibuprofen, but Ibuprofen upset her stomach, so was changed to Celecoxib 200 mg twice daily as needed. Topicals and Benadryl were renewed. (Benadryl helped rash, but patient ran out and had recurrence of pruritic rash.) Muscle pain continued in her extremities. Reported fair control of muscle pain with topical analgesics and Celecoxib. Reported having &#34;muscle spasms&#34; in her hands. Patient reported increased sensitivity  painful sensation when she touched something cold. Reported using a pot holder to hold a cold can of soda to reduce pain.  Joint pain primarily in hands, wrists, shoulders, feet, ankles, and knees. Reported swelling of hands and wrists resolved after about 2 weeks. She also had swelling of her left foot, which resolved. Reported some relief of joint pain with topical analgesics and Celecoxib, but joint pain interfering with sleep. Patient&#39;s fatigue continued. Spouse describes as decreased stamina. An example:  they used to go out to do errands over a 2-hour period and it would not impact patient&#39;s energy level; now, after 2 hours of minimal-to-moderate activity, patient is exhausted.  Follow-up with PCM on 8 and 18 Mar 2021  rash resolved, but generalized muscle aches and joint pains continue.  No localized joint swelling. Full ROM. Labs ordered (see below)  patient&#39;s Rheumatoid Factor was elevated; she is pending a Rheumatology evaluation (appointment on 17 April). No history of recent trauma or injury. No previous history of similar joint pain. No history of arthritis or Rheumatic disease.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Very tired after vaccination.  Went to sleep about 8 PM Sat 1/16 and slept most of the next 4 days.  Stomach  was queasy.  Unable to drink coffee.  Tried to push fluids and tried to just eat bland foods.  Would wake up sporadically but was unable to awaken enough to watch an entire TV show. Pretty lethargic and brain fog.  Was able to wake up a little more on Wed 1/20 but still had the queasy stomach.  Started getting Headache and Eye pain and severe upper leg  and lower back burning &amp; cramping, I tried taking tylenol which helped a little.  By Thursday  the pain was worse.  I was still tired  only walking helped the pain. It got worse if I sat down and extremely bad if I laid down to try to sleep. It&#39;s Friday morning &amp; I am planning to go to med check this AM.  Symptoms still ongoing

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EJ1686, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 11:00 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arm soreness from flu shot 2-3 months ago. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on her left arm on 31Dec2020 as she works with elderly at nursing home and she was of age. Two days after her shot, on 02Jan2021, she experienced little headache which lasted all day but was gone by the following day. On 12Jan2021, 2 days ago, when she woke up and got of bed with severe pain in right shoulder joint and right hip joint which lasted for maybe 10 minutes. It was so severe she could hardly get out of bed. Currently, she had no joint pain. The right shoulder and right hip pain were so odd she thought, but it has also improved since. It&#39;s been 2 weeks and she never had this happen before. This lasted a little while, but thought it was from the cold weather since it&#39;s been 2 weeks since having the vaccine. She still has a bit of tenderness on the left arm where she received the vaccine dose on an unspecified date. She mentioned this to her supervisor and was encouraged to call and she wants to know if this could be a side effect. The patient had no vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. She had the flu shot before in past and the area would be sore for a few days, but now with this Covid vaccine this arm was still tender. Also, she had gotten the shingles shot the same day as the flu shot but that was about 2-3 months ago, at least 2 months ago. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Covid vaccine. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the first administration. Outcome of event headache was recovered on 03Jan2021; severe pain in right shoulder joint and right hip joint/it was so severe she could hardly get out of bed was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of tenderness on the left arm where she received the vaccine dose was not recovered.

Took 2 Tylenol and it improved. 6 hours later I took another 2 Tylenol because the headache came back strong. I sleep a couple of times during the day, and also slept well during the night. The next day felt a little bit better but still in bed, but was able to eat better. The next day went to the Dr. and he prescribed me Meloxicam and 6 hour later Tylenol, after that is getting better.

Probably after 8AM I took my temp and I had a fever (102F) for about 10 hours. Started aching all over, joint and muscle aches, I also had headache (took Motrin and headache went away),  no pain at the injection site. Almost like I had flu symptoms. I felt miserable all day but next day when I woke up I was fine. Went to work as normal the next day. I forgot to state I had COVID in March 2020 and the symptoms I had felt very much like it.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 19Jan2021 08:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. She was sick (COVID symptoms) all Dec2020 when she was with her sister who had COVID-19. She does not know for sure that she had COVID 19 because she was never tested. She recovered from that illness about two weeks before getting the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine first dose. The cough was all gone before she had the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the vaccine on 19Jan2021, two days ago and had not had a problem. She left there and went to the gym for 1 hour afterwards. Then yesterday morning she woke up and has been sick ever since with a cough and chills. She never tested positive for COVID but she was with her sister who had it during Dec2020. She had a cough similar to the one she had in Dec2020 when she was quarantined for COVID symptoms. She was not expecting anything, but it says you can have side effects if you have had COVID-19 so she was calling in about that. On 20Jan2021 she woke up at 02:00 in the morning with a cough; injection site pain which was not sore before; headache; muscle pains, chills; joint pain; fever, but not a high fever; feeling freezing cold; and nausea. She reported &#39;cold, chills, fever, ache&#39;. She felt a little bit better today on 21Jan2021. She was scheduled to receive the second dose on 15Feb2021 at 08:15. The patient would like to know whether her history of COVID symptoms from Dec2020 may have aggravated her post-vaccination symptoms. The patient would like to know whether there have been other reports of similar post-vaccination as hers. The outcome of the events cough, injection site pain, headache, fever and feeling freezing cold was recovering; event muscle pain, joint pain and nausea was not recovered; event chills was recovered on 21Jan2021; and unknown for the other events.

If creates alternating pain in neck, shoulders and upper arms, mostly on my right side. I had the shot in my left arm. The next morning at 10:00 AM, I started having spasms in my upper right arm that continued for 6 hours. I have never had anything like this happen before. It was completely debilitating. I sat for hours with heating pad on neck and arm. It was so painful I had tears in my eyes for most of the day. I slept on and off while heat treating it. Then after about 6 hours it stopped. The next day the muscles in that area were sore.

Since then I have continually had pain &#34;all over my body&#34; My bones and muscles literally ache so badly I cannot sleep. I have called for appointment with my Dr because it isn&#39;t going away. I had a cough ( I never cough) until this past week. My concern is the ongoing  aching and soreness in different spots on my skin bones and muscles. My shoulders, neck and pelvic region.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 (at the age of 71-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination and started to receive methotrexate (ACCORD HEALTHCARE, lot number unknown, expiration date 12Nov2021) on an unspecified date (reported as seven years ago) at a dose of 17.5 mg weekly (seven tablets once a week) for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from an unspecified date. Historical vaccinations included &#34;every vaccine known. I&#39;ve had all my vaccines, flu whatever&#34;  (as reported) on unspecified dates. It was unknown if the patient had received any other vaccinationa in the fourteen days prior to this inoculation. Concomitant medications included folic acid (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). On 18Jan2021 (reported as about five days after the shot), the patient had just a little soreness and she thought that was one of the side effects that you have that with the vaccine. So, she didn&#39;t worry so much about it. But then it got progressively worse. And by the time just before she was supposed to get the second shot, it was really bad. But she thought that she was still going to get that second shot which was planned for &#34;02Feb2021 or 03Feb2021&#34; (also reported as on 02Feb2021) because she didn&#39;t want to not get it.  She was struggling with the pain before she got the second one. She mentioned that by the time she got her second dose, she was in an RA flare. She continued by saying that she had her blood work done, &#34;on Tuesday morning&#34;  because she was due for her RA exam in Mar and it was due, and her markers for ESR, and &#34;CR whatever&#34;  were more than double what they should be. Her Rheumatololgist saw her and when she went to the doctor her shoulders, her ankles, her elbows and everything were all hot with flare ups. Treatment included Prednisone 10mg every day which was given, according to the patient,  in order to &#34;calm down my joints and everything.&#34; The action taken with methotrexate was not reported. The clinical outcomes Rheumatoid Arthritis flare up, pain, condition aggravated, ESR increased and CRP increased were reported as unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Rheumatoid arthritis flare up, ESR increased, and CRP increased cannot be excluded.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

                                                I received the first Pfizer vaccine t 2:45 PM on Thursday, 2/25/21. That night when I went to bed I felt chilled and woke up several times feeling chilled.  In the morning I felt sick with similar symptoms as when I had COVID-19 in March2020. I had head pains, inner ear pains, naseau, sore muscles, and extreme fatigue. I slept the whole day, waking up and going back to sleep. I dranka little, but just didn&#39;t feel like it. I ate a piece of toast with butter that evening and then felt naseauated.  I slept through the night and woke up feeling a little better the next day, but still feel tired and have some pains in my head.

                                                48 hours after shot in left arm I started to have a earache on left side, traveled down the left side of face, into jaw area and down left side of my throat like tonsils and into neck area.  Into 72 hours after shot my face, neck and throat area started swelling.  At that time I went to ER for assistance due to the swelling and pain.  The ER after taking  review thought it a infected saliva gland and treated me for that.  As told by ER if no large progress contact my local Dr. and see ENT.  On Tues. (one week from Covid injection) I was in touch with my local  Dr. they had me come to their office for some care and scheduled me with a ENT.  They have been able to get the profuse swelling down out of the left side of my face, neck and throat.  I&#39;m scheduled for a CT scan on March 5, 2021 to see where the original problem started.  I&#39;m contacting  you for two reason&#39;s  1.  I have a March 10th. appointment scheduled I need to cancel and am having issues doing this.  Even in light of all this I want to reschedule for late April for my second shot and am not able to do that as well.   2.  Can you assist with any information if this has happened to other folks and if I should be clear to take my second dose.  This has been quite a nightmare and hard to bring under control.  I believe in the vaccine and this maybe just a quirk in how it happened but any information you can give me would be welcome.  I have looked on the website and it does say that there have been people who have also had symptoms like this from the shots where the side they get the shot on reacts.  Thanking you in advance for your time and assistance.

                                                This was the second shot in series of 2. First shot only gave me a sore arm at site &amp; was administered on February 6, 2021.  Second shot was administered on March 3, 2021. Started feeling these adverse effects about 9 or 10 am the following morning, 3/4/2021. Symptoms were soreness at site, in muscle that goes to the neck, headache, soreness across upper back/shoulder to shoulder. By 4 pm on 3/4, my entire body was reacting with extreme joint pain in all joints, extreme joint stiffness, skin was tender to the touch, temperature of 100.1, sore/stiff neck, and continuing headache. Temperature ceased around 11:30 pm but all other symptoms remained upon going to bed at 1 a.m., 3/5/2021. Upon waking at about 7:30 am 3/5/2021, all symptoms had diminished enough for me to go to an appointment at 10:45 am. However, by the time I headed back home at about 1:30 pm, I was so sleepy I could hardly keep my eyes open. More stiffness and achiness had returned too, especially a sore left underarm. Not the extent of night before, but enough to be uncomfortable. Today, 3/6/2021, I have noticed a sore muscle traveling from my left underarm down to my waist.

I started rotating neck, but continued for about 30 minutes.  My neck on that side became stiff and painful.  I continued throughout the pm to exercise my neck .  By bedtime, it was no longer warm.  Still slightly stiff, next morning,  a bit stiff.  By 36 hr, totally back to normhe,  I  am an RN, retired &amp; daughter is RN, active, didn&#39;t see reason to contact Dr.

                                                The shot was given to me (Sat) in the upper (L) arm about 2 -1/2 inches down from top of shoulder.  It was a simple prick however I thought it seemed an odd location.  About 24 hours later (Sun) I felt first signs of tenderness at the site but didn&#39;t think much of it as that is what I had heard from others about the vaccine.  Later in the day it became achy.  On Monday morning I noticed my whole arm was achy in addition to the top of my shoulder and the left side of my neck and  upper shoulder blade.  At 9:30 am I felt very tired and laid down and awoke 4 hours later!  My aches were still all there as though I had slept wrong.  Again I was not too concerned except that my friends all said their discomfort was gone within 24 hrs.  Today is Tuesday and evening and as I sit here I have a very tender, sore, achy upper left arm and a small black and blue spot at the site.  It&#39;s strange because it doesn&#39;t hurt when I touch it, instead it is just an ache/pain that I feel and especially when I move the arm.  The tightness and ache in my neck and back and shoulder has lessened.  I am reporting as I was not expecting this type of reaction especially to last  3-1/2 days so far.  I feel this adverse reaction probably has more to do with the location that the technician chose to give me the vaccine.  I am thinking the muscles are reacting to injection.

                                                With my first vaccine shot on 2/1/21 I developed a small itchy spot on my neck immediately following injection.  The doctor on site recommended waiting there at the hospital to monitor it for a few minutes, and I did, and the spot went away.  My second vaccination was 2/24/21 and the next day, around noon, I started to have a back ache.  Late afternoon I became a little light headed and slightly queasy.  That night the pain started in my joints - neck, shoulders, all down my back.  They became rather intense, and at one point during the night, after I had managed to fall asleep, I was awoken with burning pain in both elbows, and random sharp pains in toes and fingers.  I took Tylenol through the afternoon and night.   The following day I was still sore, but not in pain.  Then all symptoms disappeared. Not severe enough to seek medical attention but thought I ought to report symptoms for medical research reasons.

This 71-years-Old female patient received the first dose of (Pfizer Biontech Covid 19 Vaccine, Lot No. EN6198) intramuscularly at single dose on 23Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant history and concomitant drugs were unknown. Past dug included flu vaccine in Sep2020. The patient received her first dose of Covid 19 vaccine on 23Feb2021 at 3:30 in the afternoon. She came home and felt, not bad at any time but more or less towards 6:00 or 7:00 at night she started feeling bad. Her whole left side of body started going numb around 7 or 8 that night. Her arm was painful, face lips and all left side was numb. Felt like she couldn&#39;t move it like paralyzed a little bit. Clarified as whole left side, even her leg, her feet everything on that left side. She started feeling pains in bones of head, especially her face, clarified all of her face and her left side was numb even her lips on the left side were numb. Her tongue was a little numb. She had muscle and joint pain. The pain, of course, in the arm, but that was normal. Clarified pain in the arm as the injection site. She didn&#39;t feel any swell there. She did not take medication for anything. She used a lotion. The lotion was trividol aloe vera arnica caleudula and helped to relive the pain. The arm was still a little painful but it&#39;s not bad but that feeling made her tachycard, clarified as high heart rate, feeling like boom boom boom, but she did not have any shortness of breath. The high heart rate was gone the same day. She had no fever or chills.

She had not been to the doctor in a while. She was still old fashioned so she carries everything in a little telephone book. While trying to read information caller states she had to change her eyes.  She still felt numbness in left side of left leg but she thought it might be because she had not been exercising. When she was waking up around 9am in the morning, it was yesterday that she felt better in regards to the paralyzed feeling. When pains in her face came she felt and she thought what is this? It only lasted for a little while. It was during the night.  The pain and soreness in arm at injection site is still there, she did not feel any swelling, or hot at that site.

Would not have thought it was related to the vaccine, except that the exact same pain showed up 2 days after I got the first vaccine,  and I have never had it before. Lasted 3-4 days-faded away. (Did not report at that time - thought I had strained something.) Very painful, does not appear to be muscular, heat does not help. Hurts much worse with breathing in deeply, any movement. Also have pain in left ankle radiating up the inside of the leg, which I also had with the first shot and at that time attributed to new shoes, which had also gone away weeks ago.

                                                I am having increasingly bad pain in both arms, wrists, hands, knees, neck. My pain in especially bad at the injection site. The first shot on Jan 11 caused a terrible sore arm that only lasted a day, the second shot on Feb 1 caused a sore arm that lastsd 3 days, then this full body pain began and has not abated (45 days). The pain is spreading now to my quadriceps and my calf muscles and the pain seems to be mostly in muscles or tendons. Someone suggested I had RA but my joints (except wrists) are good. I&#39;m taking Ibuprofen every 4 hours. I did a 5 day blast of 50MG prednisone about 3 weeks ago and that helped a lot, but pain is back and worse.

This 71-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unspecified if &#39;EL9264&#39; or &#39;3L9264&#39;), via an unspecified route of administration, on 09Feb2021 01:30PM at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid disease (was diagnosed in her 40s, 30 years ago) from 1991, blood pressure high (was diagnosed in her 40s, 30 years ago) from 1991, mitral valve prolapse from 2001 (was diagnosed about 20 years ago), little heart disease (which she was told was nothing to worry about), her heart running away from her (They did extensive heart tests and pictures, all that stuff, put her on a medicine called Atenolol which makes her heart beat regularly and not have spells while she is walking of her heart running away), and double knee surgery three years ago (2018) when they put in false knees. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid disease, atenolol (ATENOLOL) from 1991 for &#39;her heart running away from her&#39; (She has been on atenolol 30 years, since she was 40 something. It is good medicine, and she doesn&#39;t have her heart running away.), tramadol (TRAMADOL) for double knee surgery three years ago (2018) when they put in false knees, and she also takes two high blood pressure medications. The patient added that all of the medications she takes she has been on about 30 years. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), on 18Jan2021 01:30PM on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that she had received both doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She has been told that the AEs (adverse events) associated with the vaccine would happen within 12 hours. However, her AEs had been occurring in stages. On 10Feb2021, she had muscle pain. On 11Feb2021, she woke up and threw up and was in bed all day having fatigue. At the date of report, 12Feb2021, she was still on her bed, tired, and having chills. She wanted to know if it is normal to have these reactions 3 days after the shot. She further reported that she got the second dose. And after feeling wonderful after the first dose, she got the second dose on 09Feb2021 and later that night her lower back was killing her. She later clarified that she had low back pain. She stated that she knows that part of side effects that she read for when someone got the shot was that they can have a headache and she was told side effects should only last 12 hours. She stated that on the 11Feb2021, she woke up that morning and couldn&#39;t make it out of bed and vomited, then had to get up and clean her bed and put on new sheets. She only vomited once. She stated she has been so tired and lethargic that she stayed in bed all day on the 11Feb2021. At the time of report, on February 12Feb2021, she was having chills, she couldn&#39;t get warm, and she didn&#39;t have a fever, but she is still weak. Since she was told side effects would go away within 12 hours and this has been three days, she asked if what she was experiencing was normal. As for corrective treatment the patient reported that she also takes tramadol since she had double knee surgery three years ago (2018) when they put in false knees; that&#39;s when she started taking Tramadol for that. She said she also took it for the back pain which it kept it at bay until it wore off. Her lower back pain is already gone at the time of report; she was just having chills still and was tired. She stated she has had so many symptoms on different days that she was just questioning. She stated that everyone else who was sick with the second dose it lasted 12 hours, and her friends who really got sick with it, hers is minor, but she would like to know if it is normal that it is still lasting. Outcome of the event low back pain was recovered on an unspecified date in Feb2021. Outcome of the events weak, couldn&#39;t get warm, chills and tired was not recovered.

                                                I woke up at 3am with pain in my shoulders.. Soon after I felt sharp pain in random places and times in my  body, and I would    shake shortly at random time. As time went on the pain seemed to move down my body from my shoulders to my arms then my hands and then to my legs. I fell back to sleep for a couple hours and woke with sharp random short pains and continuing aching in my joints. I noticed my speech was gravelly. I had no appetite and did not eat at all that day. I mostly slept. When out of bed I felt very weak so was up for only short times. I took one alleve pill because I was so uncomfortable.  I was not hot and did not have a fever. When I woke in themorning on 3/19/21 all that pain was gone and I felt  very rested.

It was  painful breathing in fully, taking a deep breath, lesser so when I breathe shallowly.  I felt very weak overall with multiple joints feeling pain (ankles, knees, wrist that was previously injured).  The intensity of the back/between shoulder blades pain remained throughout the following day and a bit lesser so into day three (now).

Then abdominal pain, nausea, then feeling of something really wrong, I didn?t feel well, then got weaker and weaker, couldn?t lift arms, and felt extremely fatigued, trouble staying awake.  Taken by ambulance to medical center.  On route,  ambulance stopped and another team came in. I was given epinephrine, zofran, Benadryl, and maybe a steroid? Not sure.  When I arrived at hospital, t think I was given dexamethasone and famotidine.  I was barely awake but could speak. Could not hold anything. After several hours, they woke me up, I felt myself again, and I was discharged.  Following days I felt exhausted and dizzy, and had a headache. Took prednisone for five days.

                                                The patient initially presented (3/3/21) with headache, fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, malaise. Patient related she was in her normal state of health and only started to feel poorly after she received her second COVID-19 vaccination three days earlier.  She interestingly related that after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination she had significant burning in her stomach that she noted but no other major symptoms and notably did not experience this severe burning in her stomach after the second dose. She denied any chest pain, current dyspnea, productive cough, sore throat, urinary symptoms, sick contacts.  She has no history of C. difficile, no recent antibiotics, no recent spoiled foods, no recent travel, no history of radiation.  She does have a history of GERD and has had gastritis with mild gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and undergone EGD negative for H. pylori infection.  She also has undergone colonoscopies with polyps that have been removed and reported as tubular adenomas.  As her hospitalization progressed, she was diagnosed with Severe Sepsis due to E. Coli bacteremia in setting of liver abscess, Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Transaminitis (which resolved). Patient was appropriately treated for these conditions. Also, her known uncontrolled diabetes was treated. Per an Infection Disease note on 3/9/21: The patient has had hx of biliary colic (self diagnosis) now with discovery of non-obstructive cholelithiasis on RUQ US it is plausible that the abscess originated from self limiting cholecystitis/cholangitis which would be consistent with recent abdominal pain exacerbated with oral intake. Difficult to state definitively any relation to COVID-19 vaccination, though may have resulted from associated dehydration.

                                                On Saturday Mar. 20th, I had my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  Approximately 3:00 AM, March 21, I had a very severe reaction to the vaccine causing extreme pain in my belly and lower back. (Mainly my lower right back) The pain was exactly like my kidney stone pain...so painfully intense.   Although trying to manage the pain with 2X 500 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours, I was throwing up, pacing, rocking and becoming so weary of how was I going to get through this.  A fever of 101.5 started sometime on Sunday and fluctuated but was no higher than 101.7.  A heating pad  helped to ease the pain and I was able to get some sleep until the flare up would start all over again.  This continued throughout the day for 17 hours.   By Monday , March 22, morning the intense pain was gone and my body was recouping.  My stomach was achey from either the intense pain or the vomiting.  I continured to run a fever of 101.  until Tuesday afternoon, March 23.

C reactive protein- elevated; small bruises; Itching; Difficulty chewing; Joint pain; having difficulty walking; Dry skin; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 71-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; batch/Lot Number: EN5318; expiration date not provided), intramuscular on 05Feb2021 as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing &#39;Diabetes/High sugar/ Diabetes&#39;, lymphoma (reported as in remission now) from 2010 and ongoing, &#39;General wellbeing&#39; from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing; eye floaters from an unspecified date and ongoing. Concomitant medications included glipizide from Jan2021 and ongoing for &#39;High sugar&#39;; metformin from an unspecified date (taking for a long time) and ongoing for &#39;High sugar/ Diabetes&#39;, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) from an unspecified date (taking for a long time) and ongoing; calcium from an unspecified date (taking for a long time) and ongoing; and cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]) from an unspecified date (taking for a long time) and ongoing for &#39;General wellbeing&#39;. Patient previously took bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; batch/Lot Number: EL1283; expiration date not provided) on 17Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced joint pain and &#39;having difficulty walking&#39; (both serious, disabling) and dry skin (medically significant) on 19Feb2021; itching, difficulty chewing, and small bruises (all serious, medically significant) on Mar2021; eye floaters on an unspecified date; and &#39;did the CRP and it was elevated/C reactive protein- elevated&#39; (non-serious) on 08Mar2021. Patient&#39;s clinical course is as follows: a physician reporting on behalf of his wife (patient). It was reported that patient received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Reporter stated that they have side effects to report and wanted to find out how common these side effects are and how long they are going to last. Patient received first dose on 17Jan2021 and second on 05Feb2021. It was reported that the patient has been having joint pain starting from 19Feb2021 and it fluctuates from one joint to another so if the patient&#39;s shoulder is affected, the joint pain goes to the other side and then to a different joint such as her knee joint. The pain was continuous, and it doesn&#39;t disappear. Reporter mentioned that it gets better with medication but it&#39;s still not going away. Regarding patient&#39;s treatment, it was reported that in the beginning, patient was taking ibuprofen but now the doctor switched it to naproxen (ALEVE) and also added hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen (NORCO). Reporter mentioned that sometimes not only the patient&#39;s joints gets affected, patient also experienced difficulty chewing, but it goes away and then comes back. Patient also had dry skin, itching, and sees eye floaters sometimes. Initially, reporter mentioned that patient doesn&#39;t have eye floaters before but now she does, then clarified she has seen it before the vaccine, but now she sees it more and it is pretty much every day. Patient also had small bruises. Reporter just wanted to know if someone can tell him if it&#39;s related to vaccine and how long this might last. Seriousness criteria for joint was reported that this is disabling as the patient was having difficulty walking, getting up from the bed from the chair, patient has to use a walker to walk and needs help going to bathroom and taking a shower. It was reported that joint pain has definitely affected patient&#39;s normal walking. Reporter also mentioned that he was not exactly sure when the dry skin started but it was around the time the joint pain started. Seriousness criteria for dry skin and itching was reported as medically significant because it does bother the patient. Patient was scratching even in her sleep, even though they use the moisturizer and cream. Reporter clarified it was not debilitating but it does bother the patient. Reporter mentioned that difficulty chewing started over the last few days, on Friday or Saturday. It comes and goes, one day patient might have it in the afternoon, but it goes away in the evening. Reporter added that the eye floaters started more in the last one week. They do not know why this is happening, if it was vaccine related or not. The medicines the patient takes shouldn&#39;t be causing these, but they don&#39;t know if it was the medicine causing it or if it&#39;s the vaccine. Causality for was reported as &#39;didn&#39;t have these issues before, thinks it&#39;s related, this is for all the events&#39;. It was further reported that the doctor did the CRP and it was elevated also reported as C reactive protein- elevated on Monday 08Mar2021. Outcome of the events &#39;small bruises&#39; and &#39;did the CRP and it was elevated. C reactive protein- elevated&#39; was unknown; outcome of the remaining events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known drug profile, a contributory role of bnt162b2 to the reported events  cannot  be totally excluded.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.

Medical history included diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago, obesity, asthma with bronchitis as a child, allergy to other medications, anaphylactic reaction to sulfas twenty years ago (also reported as 50 years ago), muscle hurt/sore arm usually when she got a flu vaccine (unspecified) once a year, allergies to makeup and clothes (diagnosed at least 50 years ago), heart beats fast, low thyroid and borderline high cholesterol.

The patient did not receive any other vaccinations on the same day or within 4 weeks of the vaccine. The patient previously took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) as pre-medication since she had allergic reactions to some things and would get this before the flu shot; as well as salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA) for runny nose and coughing. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 28Feb2021, and &#34;they&#34; wanted to give her diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) after the vaccine but could not since she was driving. After the vaccination, the patient was not feeling well for 2 days (as of an unspecified date) and thought she was getting better. On 28Feb2021, the patient experienced anxiety. She was more anxious when &#34;that stuff&#34; appeared on the news on day 4 and 5 after the vaccine. She took a small dose of clonazepam 0.5 mg, dividing the pill in 4 pieces as she never took the whole thing. She took it when she got extremely anxious and tried not to take it because it can be habit forming. She may take it 3 times a week or in the middle of the night. It helped a little bit, but she still felt panicky and upset. She woke up feeling anxious. She did not normally take these medications. The patient reported that she experienced headache (constantly several times a week) and left arm sore at injection site, itchiness/ itching all over body (not constant but still happening) from 28Feb2021. On Mar2021 (day 4), the patient experienced dizziness (comes and goes and was not constant like it was), was very exhausted, nausea (tapered off after 2 weeks), diarrhea, some cramping in stomach, brain fog (still struggling and forgets to take her insulin, not as bad as when she first noticed), body aches. At first, the body aches were a pain in the left knee and left elbow and then moved to various joints and muscles. The left knee and elbow pain persisted without ever going away, but also moved to different areas. The calf muscle in left leg pain is also constant. The patient experienced pain in the joints and stinging pain in left leg (below knee down to ankle) from 04Mar2021, runny nose (tapered off) from 07Mar2021, and on an unspecified date muscle pain, back pain, fever, neck pain, pain in left arm. On Mar2021 (two weeks after vaccination), the patient had a red circle around injection site not all the way filled in, but rim around where she got shot. On Mar2021 (3 weeks after vaccination), the patient experienced a weak feeling in arms and legs and other times when she stood up her body felt heavy (persistent but not every day). The patient spoke with her physician who did not believe the patient about the symptoms and recommended she seek psychiatric help. The patient had not received the second dose of the vaccine because her physician did not recommend it. She was upset because her physician told her she could not get the second shot. She was having worsening anxiety because she had not been feeling well for so long, going on 7 weeks. She visited her physician&#39;s office 6,7, or 8 times. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included an ultrasound of the leg (did not have a blood clot), an X-Ray of the back (unknown results) and an MRI of the back (did not find anything) to determine the pain. The physician thought it might be a compression fracture, but the MRI did not show anything. The patient was tested for antibodies on 05Apr2021 and had zero antibodies. The clinical outcome of anxiety, felt panicky, neck pain was unknown; dizziness, headache, runny nose, itchiness, pain in the joints, muscle pain, back pain, fever, very exhausted, nausea, diarrhea, some cramping in stomach, brain fog, body aches, stinging pain in left leg / pain in left arm, weak feelings in arms and legs, body feels heavy, left arm sore at injection site, red circle around injection site, not feeling well,  was resolving.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at left arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included low sodium, Covid-19 in Nov2020 (She had felt sick for a week and on 13Nov2020 she went to the ER and they did blood tests and she could not eat or drink for 3 days. She stated that she had 4 different IV fluids going and one of them was sodium and the other was for nausea), blood did not clot properly, broke her back. There were no concomitant medications.The patient had a unique reaction after receiving the Covid-19mRNA Vaccine. She clarified that she never had a reaction to a shot before. She received the vaccine on 31Dec2020 and was fine for the first 20 hours. She said that the next morning on 01Jan2021 at 0600 she woke up cold  and could not get warm. She said that she spent the next 24 hours to where she kept adding clothes and blankets to keep warm. She stated that she was freezing and the she felt like the interior of her body was freezing even down to her toes felt cold. She also had injection site pain and the arm felt heavy and stated that the pain extended from her shoulder down to her elbow. She stated that the injection site pain was kind of delayed. She had aches and pains. She said that some of the pain went from the injection shoulder and spread to the middle of her spine. She had nausea and total loss of appetite and could not even eat. Her aches and pains after the vaccine were similar aches like she had with the Covid. She said that she had a terrible headache when she had Covid though. She stated that after the 24 hours of receiving the vaccine she had a little headache, but she took a migraine pill for it. She said that she was able to shed clothes, but she could not take a shower, but within 24-36 hours she was back to normal like it all never happened. She said that was when she figured out it was like her hemorrhaging with one of her childbirths. She explained that she had 3 children and hemorrhaged with each of her child births and was going into shock with one of them and felt this freezing sensation due to blood loss. She thought that her reaction to the vaccine was so bad that she was either not making blood or there was an interference. There was some kind of weird interruption. She said that her blood clots break down from minutes to hours after her child birth or with dental procedures. She had a PAI-1 deficiency or Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 deficiency. She said that there was also something deeper that her doctors had not figured out yet too. She said that her blood did not clot properly. She said that she did not bruise or anything, but she was not allowed to have internal surgery without a transfusion. She said that her doctor&#39;s started to figure this all out after she broke her back before. She went to a hematologist and had her counts checked regularly. She said that she was being studied by 127 different clinics. She gained 10lbs, but she was very physically active. This was her first dose of teh vaccine. She said that her doctors told her that she needs to be under 48 hours of observation if she gets the second vaccine. Her primary care physician recommended that she did not take another mRNA vaccine. She said that she was taking their advice and canceled her second dose appointment. She said that when she had Covid-19 they did a Chest x-ray on 13Nov2020 and she had low sodium. She said that they gave her tramadol at the hospital for her headache, but she had already taken 3 migraine pills that day. She had already had her flu shot and read somewhere on a website, that mRNA vaccines might cause unstable anticoagulation. She wondered if it could be possible that Covid-19 antibodies interfered with her injection? The outcome of events was unknown.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EK9231, via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization.

She wonders if she is out of her head, since it was the very next morning, this was Tuesday, and instantly, she was sitting with ice and trying to get ahold of her healthcare person, she gets pain shots in her back, but she hasn&#39;t had them in a couple years, she was going along pretty good, then this was bad enough, it is in her thigh and leg, and is always under her foot, and she just thought it was swelling in her spine. She wonders if it is a side effect or her imagination. When asked for address, the patient stated her brain is going blank. She stated this may be just her. She has bad back problems, and was going along pretty good, it has been a year or two since she has had any kind of anything. But this was a good one, a strong one, the ice hurts so bad. She woke up with it, it is staying the same- after having something like this, she was trying to get ahold of the pain clinic, to get a shot, but that may be 3-4 weeks out. She has had no blood work in a while. Outcome of the events &#34;she just thought it was swelling in her spine&#34; and &#34;her brain is going blank&#34; was unknown; while not recovered for other events.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 at a single dose in the hospital for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety, seizures, and high cholesterol. She passed out last summer and they put her in the hospital from 31Aug2020 and ran all kinds of tests. In the end, they said she only had a few PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) and she doesn&#39;t need to see the doctor for a year. Mentioned she also has chronic bronchitis and this is related to having low platelet count and low immunity. All of these events predate treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin for high cholesterol, clonazepam for seizures, escitalopram for anxiety, levothyroxine sodium for thyroid, and mirtazapine for sleep; all were ongoing. Stated that she had something weird happen after her injection about four hours after the shot. She received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 in the right arm. About three or four hours later on 13Jan2021, she was getting ready for bed and when she sat down and leaned over she had a god awful burning in her chest and nausea. She was going to take baking soda but when she sat up she had horrible pressure and pain in her chest and felt woozy so she sat on the floor and then the pain started to radiate through her arm and into her neck. The horrible pain and pressure in her chest felt like something was sitting on her chest and the bad pain in her chest was going into her arm and a little into her neck. She laid real still on the floor, and did a lot of praying, and then 20 minutes later it totally stopped. She got up slowly and finished getting ready for bed and was fine. She was just hoping they will still let her get the second shot. The whole event only lasted 20 minutes and when it was over it was completely gone. She did tell her husband when he came home. She was alone when this happened. The patient wanted to know if she can receive second dose of vaccine. She stated it almost felt like a heart attack. She was planning to get the second dose on 03Feb2021. Wanted to know if her effect will preclude her from getting the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.

She sees the date of when she is supposed to return for her second vaccine, 04Feb2021. She sees the lot number and then it has (name of center). The actual dose is unknown, she knows this is her first dose. She also receives infusions for her arthritis. She receives an infusion at a facility once a month, she used to receive it less than that, but her arthritis has been really bad, so she now does it once a month. She was supposed to go today but she didn&#39;t go because she didn&#39;t feel good. She had three COVID tests done because she had the sinus situation going on. A COVID test was done yesterday (14Jan2021) and it was negative. Another one was done when she had a gastric endoscopy on 09Dec2020. This test was also negative. She doesn&#39;t remember if she had another one in Dec2020 when she was at the emergency center, but all of her COVID tests have been negative. The patient has not recovered from headache. Outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

Medical history included her left eye had a virus that was finally taken care of back in Mar2020 but took a year and a half to heal. She had 5 surgery on that eye from an unspecified date. Also, her left lymph node got filled with fluid and was swollen but the doctors were not concerned about it. She would see an ENT for this. The patient has been seeing a neurologist who has done brain scans and MRI&#39;s due to the loss of peripheral vision do to eye problems. The patient has no allergies and is basically healthy. Concomitant medications include unspecified &#34;natural stuff&#34;. The reporter stated she had a pretty bad reaction with the vaccine and it took 3 days to get over, her neck froze up. She woke on 22Jan2021 with the frozen neck. She got the first shot on Thursday, 21Jan2021, and on Friday morning, 22Jan2021, when she woke up she could not look up, down, left or right. It was like her neck was frozen or paralyzed, the muscles would not move. Any effort to move her neck would send shooting pain in her head. She applied a heating pad, took Aleve, she took a couple of them, a massager, biofreeze, and stayed in bed. She was doing anything to loosen the muscles. The next morning she was able to look up and down but still not left or right. She did the same thing for treatment that day. On Sunday, 24Jan2021, she was better, was able to move her head 3 of 4 directions. She continued with the treatment she had been using and by Monday, 25Jan2021, her muscles loosed up and her neck worked again. She was sure it is muscles and when she called her neurologist confirmed it was a muscle issue. She was in a lot of pain in her head and neck. The patient was under care for her neck and head and wondered if this happened because this was a weak area, she did not know if related. The patient remarked she was scared to get the second dose due to the problems she had with the first. She heard that the second dose was the one with worse side effects. She was in bed 3 days with this first one. It was reported that the events did not require a visit to Emergency Room, and required visit to physician office. Patient called the neurologist due to the pain and was told to go to acute care to evaluate but she didn&#39;t go. The patient stated that this was scary like waking up with Bells palsy and was wondering if she would ever get better. She has never had anything like this happen to her before. She has to be attributed it to the shot. The patient needed guidance on getting the second dose, and had questions about side effects. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                angina; angina; Fever; Chills; Cough; Sore throat; runny nose; Nausea; Diarrhea; Headache; arm heavy; muscle aches and heaviness; muscle aches and heaviness; she just woke up feeling sick; fevers may come like a hot flash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (HCP) (patient). A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at a single dose, in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fibromyalgia diagnosed years ago, angina (some stents). There were no concomitant medications. On Jan2021, the patient experienced angina, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, nausea, diarrhea, headache, arm heavy, muscle aches and heaviness, and she just woke up feeling sick. The patient experienced multiple AEs after 1st dose of vaccine (received on 23Jan2021). The patient experienced angina later last week. Clinical course: The patient has misplaced card, states her second appointment for the second dose is this Saturday. Caller stated she started having these experiences the day after she was vaccinated with her first dose, received first dose of 23Jan2021. She had fevers, chills, cough- not an aggressive cough, a funny kind of sore throat- like something wrapped around her throat like the muscles of her throat, no congestion but does have a runny nose, states she has some nausea, no vomiting but feeling like she needed to vomit and diarrhea, and headache. The symptoms started about the third day after the vaccine, started with the fevers, stated the fevers may come like a hot flash, lasts seconds even, states you know it is a fever because your bones get hot. These symptom&#39;s did not attack her body at one time. Her whole arm stayed heavy, the whole arm not just the injection site, for almost 10 whole days. She previously had fibromyalgia and thought maybe that made the symptoms worse. She had muscle aches and feeling heavy. Her symptoms were spread out over time, no two were at the same time, sore throat was one of the last things. Diarrhea was ongoing, not a runny diarrhea but it was enough to empty stomach and was soft. She was a medic in the military, worked as a Nurse, clarifies she was an LPN and took all the underlying courses to be a PA. One of the issues she found, she thought it may be deadly, as a prior healthcare person and in tune to her body, the people who are in the nursing homes may not be mobile, states so one of the things she felt was just feeling really really sick, that she couldn&#39;t put a pin point on it, states she just woke up feeling sick, states she had the urge to get out of bed and got up and after she got up the feeling left her, states a person in the nursing home may just feel really bad and cannot get up, thinks a protocol should be that the people that are immobile should be required to move or if they can&#39;t get up they need to move their muscles, people with these symptoms need to get up and get moving. She also has history of angina and a stent, has not had angina in a while and had 3 days where she thought she may need to go talk to her doctor. It was on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week. States one of her friends, 92 years old, said she got high after the vaccine and didn&#39;t want to talk to anybody, states it was her first dose, she was kind of leery about the 2nd shot, feels like this was kind of aggressive. She had both doses and had no symptoms, but 92-year-old female had no symptoms right away, other than normal body aches and pains, but the next day was high as a kite. Her son has heart disease and she advised him not to take it right now. They were losing a lot of people to the vaccine in nursing homes, no further information provided. This could be affecting good hearts more than damaged hearts, read that this virus likes to work in parts of the body that are already damaged. The outcome of event diarrhea was not recovered, outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, a causal association between the reported angina and BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. Note however, that the patient has underlying angina with some stents that may also have contributed to the event. Case will be re-assess once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9261; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration from 21Jan2021 to 21Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for an unspecified indication. Medical history included &#39;thyroid&#39; from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing at 100 ug, 1x/day for &#39;thyroid&#39;. Patient stated that she spoke with her physician&#39;s assistant. Patient received vaccine on the 21st of January, the first shot at her local place. The following morning at 4 in the morning, patient had severe arm pain where the shot was injected. So patient put a hot compress on it and took some paracetamol (TYLENOL). Patient mentioned that it didn&#39;t relieve for about an hour and a half. Patient meant the pain was really severe but finally it went away. The next day, it came back again and then the patient did it again and the pain keep coming back. Patient stated &#34;And now it&#39;s been tomorrow will be a week. And that&#39;s too long to have muscle pain from my shot&#34;. Patient also mentioned that second day after the shot, migraine headache started. Patient stated, &#34;Now I get them, but I only get them in the spring and I get them in the Fall. I don&#39;t get the migraine headaches in the winter time. I could only take Excedrin Migraine for the migraine, it&#39;s just over the counter medicine. And so I took that for the headache but those have not gone away either. When patient contacted her physician&#39;s assistant just now, it was reported that patient the physician&#39;s assistant is going to write a prescription for a muscle relaxer. Patient also reported that she is not going to take that second shot as she didn&#39;t know where to go to cancel it but she is not taking it. Patient mentioned she can&#39;t have pains like this. Patient stated that she can&#39;t tolerate pain to begin with, let alone have excess pain in her system. Patient added that she doesn&#39;t take medications. She is only on a thyroid medication (later confirmed the name as levothyroxine). Patient confirmed that the vaccine was Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. When probed for the due date of the next shot, patient stated &#39;February 11th at 12 o&#39; clock&#39;. Patient also stated &#39;I am not getting it, I am not taking the second shot. I didn&#39;t get you, I don&#39;t know what you said. I am not understanding you. I am not getting what you are saying. I am not taking the second shot, it is scheduled for February 11th of 2021, I am not taking it. Because they called and asked if I wanted to receive it and my age is almost 73. So, I thought I probably should give it a chance. But now with the reaction I don&#39;t want the second one&#39; and &#39;I don&#39;t know if there is something wrong with this phone or something wrong with the connection, I don&#39;t understand, I get part of it but I don&#39;t understand the other part. It blanks out, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong, you are asking me something, but I don&#39;t know what it is&#39;. Patient also reported that the pain started the day after she got the shot, 22Jan2021. Patient is still having pain. Patient also confirmed that TYLENOL was the treatment for pain but it was not working. Medication for migraine was reported as EXCEDRIN migraine. Patient further confirmed EXCEDRIN Migraine did not help with the migraine and stated &#39;No, I still have it, it gives me some relief but then after wears off it comes back, the migraine comes back&#39;. Patient further added &#34;Okay, I am just going to rely on my physician assistant, she has got some medication ordered for me, a muscle relaxer. And I am going to try that and see if that will make everything go away&#34;.  Outcome of the events &#39;severe arm pain where the shot was injected&#39; and &#39;migraine headache&#39; was not recovered; outcome of the remaining event was unknown.

                                                Discovered a lump about three inches to the left of my throat while I was on my way to my doctor&#39;s office for my annual wellness exam    when I  felt a sharp pain near that area.  I instinctively reached over and put my hand on the area and immediately felt a lump. My doctor examined me and asked me some questions about when I first felt the lump and how was I feeling, etc.  I told her I had my second vaccine three days prior.  She gave me a prescription for bloodwork which is part of my annual exam process along with an appointment to see me again on March 16th.   I had the bloodwork yesterday morning.

I am now very uncertain ifI can tolerate a second dose on March 20.  I cannot take anything except Tylenol, and that doesn&#39;t touch the pain.

                                                I have now had my 2nd vaccination (3/1/21) and had the same reaction both times.  I experienced severe muscle and joint pain starting 12 hours after each injection; this lasted about 36 hours.  I rested and took Advil and Tylenol.  I think this reaction might have been because I received Bamlanivimad 11/24/20 as a treatment for Covid.  Just a thought - I did not contact my doctor and after 36 hours I am fine - I would do it all over again in a hearbeat!! Just thought I would add my comments to your database. Thank you.

                                                Immediately upon leaving the COVID shot parking lot at Hospital, I began to feel pain shooting down my arm all the way to my fingertips. Then I started to feel disoriented. Then, as I was driving myself home, I felt constriction in my chest, like I was barely holding onto consciousness, then pain shooting up my shoulder into the left side of my neck, the left side of my face, my left eye and into the left side of my head. My heart was pounding, my head was hurting intensely and I wondered whether I was having a stroke while trapped in stop and go traffic. The intense pain continued while I drove, for about 30 minutes. Then it subsided somewhat -- but continued through the evening. I could not get to The pain continued in my arm, up the left side of my body and into my head all night. I could not sleep. My heart was pounding. Somehow I dozed off around 2 or 3am. The next day I felt groggy and tired, with the more moderate pain continuing in my arm and all the way to my hand. Finally, on Monday morning, I was able to reach my doctor&#39;s office. I was told to go the ER, which I did. They could find nothing &#34;emergent.&#34; The pain, tiredness and headaches continued through Thursday. Friday I started to feel better -- a week after the shot on Saturday, 2/27.

No soreness in that arm prior to this event. I had a fine tremor on extension of my left arm. Symptoms resolved after 45 minutes , but returned within a half hour and repeated. I called my doctor and spoke to the advice nurse. I was adviced to go  to the ER within one hour. Instead a did some deep breathing and relaxation and my symptoms resolved and have not returned. I spoke to a doctor and agreed to go to the ER if they returned and also discussed the symptoms with my primary doctor during a video visit and she adviced daily baby ASA.

                                                I was fine when getting the injection and my ½ hour wait. I was fine during dinner and after dinner and until about 9 hours after the injection when my arm felt exceedingly sore. I had been watching a free Amazon Prime cute movie while knitting a blanket for my grandson. When the movie was over and I was clearing my knitting, I noticed my super sore arm. I got up to check my face in the mirror to be sure that I was not having a reaction. But I did have a reaction with a rash on my chest and face 9 hours after the injection. My arm really hurt for three days but is fine now.  When I saw my red face and chest, I took a Zyrtex D and a Benadryl.  It did not seem to help the redness to go away. When I felt some tightening of my throat and started to feel that I might be starting to lose some clarity of thought, I quickly watched a minute video on how to use my new kind of generic epipen and jabbed myself in the leg and called 911.    I felt much better after the epipen in terms of my thinking and throat.  Basically, the medics that came to the house and said that I had taken what they would give me at the hospital and it was up to me if I wanted to go to the emergency room or not; they would take me but I would need a ride home. With the pandemic and 48 new cases, I decided to stay home and I went to bed; the rash on my face was gone in the morning. The next days I just felt muscle soreness all through my body (day 2) and felt tired (next two days) but had no fever at any time.  I am fine today. I appear to have two very small areas on my chest that probably related to the reaction.

Event: Friday, March 12, 6:00 AM excruciating total left leg shooting pain with no relief or ability to ambulate. Saturday, March 13; friend took me to the Hospital ER upon my request. The non- stop pain was intolerable! I wanted X-Rays because I thought something somehow was broken. There was no fall or any accident of any kind. The X-Rays revealed strong arthritis &amp; sent me home w crutches &amp; an Ace bandage wrap. Recommended ice &amp;/or heat, otc Tylenol or naproxen, which I did all day. Sunday, March 14, I was 80% improved. I attribute this strong reaction as triggered out of the blue by the 2nd Pfizer dose!

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

                                                On March 12, I experienced some pain in left hand.  By the next day, my hand was somewhat swollen, stiff and I had trouble grasping items.  The pain was worse on March 14, to the point that I could barely move my hand.  My arm from below my elbow  was also sore.  I took Tylenol and, later, aspirin.  My hand was swollen and the veins appeared dark through the skin.  My hand felt cold and applying warm compresses helped ease the. pain.  By March 15, the pain started to go away and by March 16, my hand and arm were back to normal.

                                                The morning following first dose I woke up with a headache, body aches, slight fever, dizzy &amp; nausea. These went on for the next week. I didn&#39;t go into work February 26th. But did go in partial days all the next week. Very uncomfortable. The headache got worse each day until it was very bad. On March 10th I woke up with my left arm in excruciating pain and the headache. Went to urgent care and doctor gave me a shot of Tromodol. When I got to the parking lot, I became very dizzy and my legs gave out and fell in the parking lot down to t he ground.  Went to ER and waited for about 3.5 hours and left and went home. Went back to ER on March 12th due to arm in constant pain. Not able to sleep or relax. Wait this time was 3 hours and I was in too much paid so my daughter took me around the corner to urgent care. I was given steroid, muscle relaxer and a cream for my arm. My left arm from muscle up to shoulder and into wrist continues to hut. Today is 3/18/2021.

Then about 2 days after I had a severe and sudden bout of plantar facsitis, then increase in other arthritis symptoms.  Then a week after I suffered a stomach virus.  Then latter that same week for two days I experienced severe right leg pain.  Then developed cluster rashes on the whole right leg.  Went to Urgent care since we are  wintering out of state.  Was diagnosed with Shingles which I have never had and hope to never have again.  The blisters are improving but the pain remains.  I very strongly feel this is ALL due to the second dose of this vaccine.       I certainly feel the second dose of this vaccine should not be given for at least 6 months.

At 11 pm went to bed with large lump in my throat, felt like I was breathing thru a straw plus whole body freezing from inside out. Could not get warm. Added layers of clothes and blankets and laid like that all nite, no sleep. 7am called nurse, advised to remove some of the layers, drink hot liquids and Tylenol every four hours. By mid afternoon the cold was gone but severe achy bones, even the bottom of my feet hurt. Next day hot and cold and ache. Fourth day dripping sweat all day and flu like symptoms. Took three showers to get sweats down plus the entire time had been taking Tylenol every four hours. Day five just drained, felt like I&#39;d been through the wringer.

A 72-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/Lot Number: ER2613), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 13:53 (at 72-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Spinal leak (Diagnosed with a spinal leak about 1-1/2 years ago. She said she has had spinal leaks, on and off, since that time.), ongoing Oral lichen planus (Stated she was diagnosed with Oral Lichen Planus between 10-15 years ago), ongoing Rheumatoid arthritis (Stated she was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at least 3 years before she was diagnosed with Oral Lichen Planus. She said she had been tested for food allergies &amp; as long as she stayed away from gluten, chicken, tomatoes &amp; some other things, she did not have a problem with her rheumatoid arthritis. She said gluten, in particular,  triggered her rheumatoid arthritis.), Gluten (triggered her rheumatoid arthritis), fractured her L4 vertebrae in last summer 2020, sciatica from Feb2020 (pinched sciatic nerve since Feb2020), Bone density issue. Stated her family has a history of autoimmune diseases, like Lupus. Concomitant medications included diphenhydramine, paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL PM, NDC Number: 50580-937-19, Lot Number: SLA006, Expiration Date: Aug2024); ibuprofen (ADVIL, UPC Number: 305730154604, Lot Number: EG1007, Expiration Date: Jul2023); gabapentin (&#34;ACI Health&#34;, Expiration Date of 05Mar2022). The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EN6198) on 02Mar2021 (at 72-years-old) Intramuscular on left arm for covid-19 immunization but experience Left arm was sore, left arm soreness went away after 2-3 days. The patient previously took Flu vaccine but experienced Mouth sores. Reported she had both COVID-19 Vaccine doses. She said she got the typical side effects of a headache, chills, not feeling well, and her body was aching. She clarified those side effects started late the night of her second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (24Mar2021). She said those side effects were mild, and resolved in about 2 days. She said she didn&#39;t think much of those side effects, until the next day (25Mar2021), when the other side effects started (blacked out, lightheaded, equilibrium was off). She said her left arm was sore after her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t treat her left arm soreness, and the left arm soreness went away after 2-3 days. Reported on 25Mar2021 at about 11:30AM, she blacked out. She said she just sat down in a chair, and everything went black for a second. She said she then got really lightheaded, and her equilibrium was off. Reported she had spinal leaks, on and off, for the past 1-1/2 years. She clarified that her doctors didn&#39;t think the spinal cord leaks would be contraindicated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said all her doctors said it was up to her if she wanted to get the COVID-19 Vaccine because she previously had problems with the flu vaccine. She clarified she had a flu vaccine about 15 years ago, and the day after the flu vaccine, she got mouth sores, and the mouth sores got worse. She said her local doctors didn&#39;t know how to treat her mouth sores, so she went to the clinic. She said the clinic doctors told her she had Oral Lichen Planus, and the Oral Lichen Planus was caused by the flu vaccine she had received. She stated she did not have any information (NDC, Lot, &amp; Expiration Date) for the flu vaccine she received back then. She stated she has not had a flu vaccine since that time. Reported her spinal cord leaks caused equilibrium, and lightheadedness. She said she thought her second COVID-19 Vaccine exasperated her spinal cord leak symptoms because her lightheadedness, and equilibrium being off, started on 25Mar2021 11:30. She said her lightheadedness, and equilibrium being off was still going on. Reported she hurt more, too, in her L4 &amp; L5 vertebrae, and had pain throughout her whole body. She clarified she fractured her back (specifically her L4 vertebrae) last summer (2020), and her L4 vertebrae had since healed. She said she had a pinched sciatic nerve since Feb2020. She clarified her L4 and L5 vertebrae move because she had 3 blood patches to treat her spinal cord leaks. She said when the blood patches were done a lot of force was used to stop the spinal leaks. She said the first blood patch caused her buttocks to really hurt. She said she had 2 more blood patches. She said she was not too sure about second blood patch, but with the 3rd blood patch, she was miserable. She said she had physical therapy weekly, and she may have to have her back fused. She said she had a bone density issue that apparently was mentioned in her medical records when she was in her 50s. She said she was never treated for her bone density issue until after she fractured her L4 vertebrae in 2020. No further details provided. Reported her last blood work was 3-4 months ago. No further details provided. Reported her Oral Lichen Planus was more pronounced since her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose (Mar2021). She clarified she started to get Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores a couple days after she received her second COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she can go months without having any issues, and then get the Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores. She said she took medication to manage her Oral Lichen Planus. She said with the medication, the Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores are gone within 24-48 hours. She said with her latest Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores, she put her medication on the mouth sores, and the mouth sores seemed to settle down, but the mouth sores didn&#39;t go away completely. She said the day before yesterday (03Apr2021), her Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores got worse again, and are staying that way, even with using the medication. Oral Lichen Planus Treatment: Stated she was applying Clobetasol Propionate Ointment UPS 0.05% to her mouth sores after she eats, or about 3-4 times a day. NDC Number: 51672-1259-6, Lot Number: 332450, Expiration Date: Aug2021. For other treatment she had medication she takes every day, and she continued to take the medication to help her symptoms. She said she had physical therapy twice a week for about 1-1/2 hours, as well as, doing physical therapy on her own. She clarified she does the physical therapy for her sciatica and vestibular issues, saying she was not steady on your feet. She said she does physical therapy about 4 hours a week. Reported her doctors told her she would not survive the Corona Virus if she were to get it because of her underlying health issues. No further details provided. Reported her doctors said there was no information reporting that the COVID-19 Vaccine was contraindicated in people with spinal cord leaks, and how the COVID-19 Vaccine would affect people with spinal cord leaks. She said she thought she may have been fighting things because the COVID-19 Vaccine was acting like the flu vaccine (when she first developed Oral Lichen Planus). She said she thought her symptoms after her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose  may have had something to do with her spinal cord leak because she had similar symptoms (lightheadedness &amp; equilibrium issues) with her spinal cord leak. She said with her spinal cord leak, she also had pain and loses her voice. No further details provided. The outcome of the events she just sat down in a chair, and everything went black for a second was recovered on 25Mar2021; headache was recovered in Mar2021; chills was recovered in Mar2021; not feeling well was recovered in Mar2021; body was aching/she hurt more, too, in her l4 &amp; l5 vertebrae, and had pain throughout her whole body was recovered in Mar2021; loses her voice was unknown; while for other events was not recovered.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39; medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced vomiting and diarrhea. Mostly diarrhea. The vomiting started 05Mar2021 in the middle of the night. She was vomiting so much she went to the Emergency room by ambulance. They kept her in the hospital for a couple of days, but she did not have diarrhea at this time. It was like three days later that she suddenly became violently ill. At the time she did not tie it to the vaccine administration, she thought she had food poisoning or something. She then had severe diarrhea. She cannot recall the exact onset date of when the diarrhea began. She can&#39;t get the dates together because she knows she became very sick. Patient recalls that when she got out of the hospital, she was having stomach pains. The stomach pains were feeling more severe on 18Mar2021. On 19Mar2021, she went to a check up with her gynecologist for an annual check up and did tell her gynecologist about the stomach pain and having a lot of stomach issues, but the doctor had no idea about it, she&#39;s a gynecologist. The patient&#39;s gastroenterologist thought maybe she had diverticulitis not related to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and on 27Mar2021, they started her on Cipro and Flagyl, but the diarrhea just kept getting worse even with the meds and its just been getting worse and worse and worse. Cipro and Flagyl were stopped after 5 days because her gastroenterologist told her that maybe all of her flora was cleared out, and the flora was causing the diarrhea. No one knows what was causing her diarrhea.  Oddly enough, she was feeling a little better today. She feels like she doesn&#39;t have diarrhea today, but she doesn&#39;t know because sometimes she has diarrhea for a couple of hours and then she feels just fine for a couple of hours. She also has brain fog. She was feeling like she could not think straight. She confirmed she does not have this feeling today. It got really bad after the second shot. The brain fog started between the time of first and second shot, when she had the diarrhea. It was like a week to ten days after the first shot, but she does not know exactly when brain fog started. It comes and goes, doesn&#39;t have it right now, and didn&#39;t have it yesterday. She stated that the brain fog seems to have gone away about 5 days ago. She had all these blood tests and cat scan and they all came back negative that she is in perfect health. She has no other issue except this constant diarrhea. Caller states she doesn&#39;t have any issues with any of her abdominal organs, her gall bladder and intestines are all fine. She has lost 5 pounds explaining that a month ago she weighed 136 pounds and now she weighs 130 pounds. The diarrhea is without any known medical known ideology and is very debilitating because she has lost a lot of weight. The outcome of events was reported as &#34;unknown&#34;.  Follow-up attempts are completed. The following information on the batch number has been requested.

A 73-Year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, on 29Jan2021 (Lot Number: EN5318) at age of 72-year-old at SINGLE DOSE in Arm Right for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension from 2010 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  She was taking her regular prescribed medications which are primary for atrial fibrillation and hypertension, however she has been on these medications for years.The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 on 8Jan2021 (Lot Number: EL3246) as SINGLE DOSE in Left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  8 or 9 days later after she received the first dose, she broke out in rash on her upper left chest and shoulder area. It spread, and she then had a patch in the small of her back and then, her legs from her knees to ankles broke out. She reports that after her 1st vaccination she developed a rash 1 week after the injection. Explaining that its a &#34;strange rash some of which I still have on my chest, the small of my back and from my knees to my ankles&#34;, The &#34;ones on my legs have never really resolved, its pretty ugly and the dermatologist said it looks like eczema&#34;. The doctor gave her some topical steroid cream &#34;Mometaesone&#34; for all of these areas. However, her legs are still not cleared up. She still has lesions there. It looks and is like eczema, but the eczema treatments are not working. For some reason instead of staying as little bumps, the bumps developed into some large, scaly patches. It&#39;s those scaly patches that are red and nasty looking which is what the dermatologist has been treating. She was also prescribed Ammonium Lactate lotion which kind of helps with the scaliness that the area produces. The patient received both doses of the COVID vaccine. Both shots were given around 1-2pm. The reaction to the second dose is far more troubling and problematic in all sorts of ways than the first dose. About 7 or 8 days after the second shot, she began to have joint pain in her elbows. She was told she has acute tendinitis and was given oral steroids to take and she was sent to physical therapy. She has had general 24HR a day intense pain in both arms. It&#39;s to the point she can&#39;t straighten her arms out completely, she can&#39;t bend them completely, especially early in the morning when she first wakes up and everything is kind of stiff. She can&#39;t even brush her teeth without having to prop her elbow on the edge of the sink. She can&#39;t brush her hair, wash her hair without pain. She has to get her partner to undo her bra because she can&#39;t. She was given a Medrol pack. With the second one, &#34;My elbows began to hurt, ortho did x-rays and said nothing was wrong with them, and that it may be tendonitis. PT who is a hand and extremity therapist said my swelling is strange and asked if I had Rheumatoid problems. She states she has to go back to dermatologist next week for them to look at the area again. In the mean time, she has taken oral steroids and topical steroids and not much has done any good. She has had reactions autoimmune disorders to both of her vaccinations, the reactions began about a week after getting vaccinated. It was stated that these symptoms are better than dying of COVID but its very unpleasant. She has had X-rays done but it showed there was nothing wrong with her joints. No one has done any blood test. The orthopedic people took X-rays because she told them her elbow hurts. She was told that there was nothing wrong with her elbows, but she does have all this other stuff going on. She clarifies she has tendonitis, tennis elbow, golf elbow- but the hasn&#39;t had anything to cause this, and she was told they are really, really bad. Her right wrist is swollen up twice its normal size as is her right elbow. It has been going on now since February, March, April. Her left arm is doing a little bit better but her right arm is pretty acute. She confirms this swelling is still ongoing and persisting in her right arm.  The AEs require a visit to Physician Office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. AE following prior vaccinations was No. She mentions she was in the military and she received many vaccines from cholera to small pox and beyond. She never had a reaction. The outcome of Joint swelling was not recovered, of left arm swelling was recovering, of other events were unknown.  No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected.

A 73-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 06Jan2021 around 13:00-14:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient got the vaccine this week on 06Jan2021 right after lunch/early afternoon. She had no issues. In the afternoon of 07Jan2021, she started getting a little dizzy and had a hard time focusing her sight. The patient also had neck and toe stiffness on 07Jan2021. She did not think about the vaccine until last evening of 07Jan2021. The hospital called to see how she was doing, and then it dawned on her. After, she took her blood pressure which was 126/68 with 81 pulse. She slept well last night of 07Jan2021. This morning on 08Jan2021 she had breakfast but still felt a little off kilter. It is like dizziness, not really dizzy, but more like her balance does not feel right. She was focusing better on 08Jan2021, but not like normal. The dizziness hit her on 07Jan2021 about 15:00. It had improved. She felt more at the time of the report, not really dizzy, but more like her balance did not feel right. It was earlier on 07Jan2021 around 14:00 she was on the ladder taking down her Christmas bows. She had no dizziness whatsoever. For neck and toes stiffness, she had one big toe that was arthritic and it did not seem to want to bend. She had been doing neck exercises which had helped. The outcome of dizziness, hard time focusing her sight, neck and toe stiffness were resolving, outcome of rest events were unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Started with join pain for a few days, started taking one Aleve a day. The muscles became extremely sore. Joint pain increased, involving shoulders, hands, legs, arms, knees and hips. Left hand began swelling on January 23rd and continued so I could no longer see my knuckles and it ballooned and it was hot and very painful. The knees were so bad it was almost impossible to stand from a sitting position and walking was stiff. Could not sleep laying down because pain in shoulders and knees would increase.   I went to the doctor on the 26th.   he prescribed Prednisolone for one week and I am scheduled to see him next Tuesday February 2nd.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 20Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing &#39;sometimes her hip and leg would hurt prior to getting the vaccine&#39;.  There were no concomitant medications. Caller received the covid shot on Wednesday, 20Jan2021, her arm was sore yesterday (21Jan2021) but better today (22Jan2021). Caller reports worsening hip and leg pain on 22Jan2021 because sometimes her hip and leg would hurt prior to getting the vaccine. Caller would like to know if it&#39;s okay to have taken Tylenol for her symptoms after taking the covid vaccine. Response: The interim ACIP guidelines note that, &#34;Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.&amp; quot;  If you are a patient, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider. Caller would like to know how long the symptoms from the covid vaccine would last. Calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine she took it on Wednesday (20Jan2021), the Pfizer Biontech, and yesterday (21Jan2021) her arm was sore all day, which is probably to be expected, but today (22Jan2021), she has, her hips and legs feel real achy, she has achiness in her hips and legs, it was asked if that is normal. it was asked if it is a side effect from the shot. Her arm is not like it was yesterday (21Jan2021) if the achiness was a side effect, she thought she may have had it yesterday (21Jan2021), but she didn&#39;t, just today (22Jan2021). The outcome her arm was sore yesterday but better today/her arm was sore was recovering. The outcome of other events was not recovered.

It was fine by the next day. Yesterday I ate some shrimp and within the hour of eating the shrimp, I was talking to my son  and my head got hot and my ears got really hot. It was itching on my forehead and the front of my neck. I thought something bite me, I went to bathroom. I had big welts on my neck about the size of the quarter and my ears were really red. I told my son that I must have hives, my son told me to take some Benadryl. It eased up after taking the Benadryl, the itching went away but the welts did not go away right away. I took another Benadryl before I went to bed last night. I was able to sleep good last night, it looked pretty much back to normal today, there is one spot left. Today when I got up I don&#39;t know how to explain it and I just didn&#39;t feel like my normal self. I felt like nervous and shaking. I didn&#39;t feel like eating but I made my self eat.  I just feel like something isn&#39;t right.

                                                Two days after receiving the vaccine,  on Jan 28th, I noticed pain in my right lower back area.  It went away so I didn?t pay much attention to it.  On Jan 29th,   I woke up to stabbing pains in my right chest which continued to night of Jan 30th.  Morning of Jan 31st, I was very short of breath and could hardly get around.  I went to the ER in evening of Jan 31st.  I was admitted due to two pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  Doctors were convinced I had Covid 19.   However, three tests came up negative.  I was put on a Heparin drip and then eventually on Eliquis.  I have always been healthy up to this point and never had any clotting issues.  I now am on Eliquis for at least six months (have to have a follow-on echocardiogram due to issues on right side of my heart.).  I am convinced the vaccine triggered the clots.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number: EL8982 ), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 23Jan2021 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were on patient medical history and concomitant medications. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).The patient said she did good on Saturday, 23Jan2021, saying her left arm didn&#39;t get sore. She said she did good on Sunday, 24Jan2021. She stated &#34;I didn&#39;t get sore, but it just seemed like maybe a few days ago it seemed like a sharp pain was coming from the side of my back and shooting to my left breast (on 25Jan2021). It only does it when I am lying down and not when I am sitting down. I drank plenty of water and continue to drink plenty of water. Today, I am feeling a little down and out because of my breast (25Jan2021). My breast itself is not sore at all. It seems like maybe a muscle on the side going down of my back. There is a sharp pain when I make a turn or reach that goes to my breast. Well, if you have arthritis it could be that.&#34; She said it seemed when she moves or turns, she has a sharp pain in her left breast. The patient asked if the sharp pain she was experiencing in her left breast area were possibly her lymph nodes. She clarified her left breast was not sore, but the area behind her left breast has a pain go through it. She said it was just when she moves that she has a pain that goes through the lymph nodes or muscles behind her left breast. She said she normally doesn&#39;t sleep on her left side, but if she sleeps on her left side, the pain behind her left breast was better. She said she does not have big breasts and was not wearing a bra when she had the pain in her left breast area. She said she was wondering if the pain she has is from her lymph nodes or muscles in her back. She said the pain was either from something in her left shoulder, or the left side of her back, or a muscle. As treatment, patient reported that she has been holding her left breast area when she moves. She said holding the left breast area helps lessen the pain, but the pain was still there. She said she has been trying to troubleshoot her pain. She said she drinks coffee every day and thought maybe she was drinking too much caffeine. She said she can&#39;t sleep in the heat at night, so she turns the heat off in her house at midnight, but her house was still warm (70 degrees) when she wakes up in the morning. She said she thought that maybe the cold weather got into her back and left shoulder. She said she checked her left breast for lumps and didn&#39;t find any lumps. She said the only thing left for her to do was to contact her gynecologist and go have a mammogram. She doesn&#39;t take any medicine. She said she does take something for sleep as needed, but she would have to be going without sleep for a long time before she would take that medicine. She reported she is otherwise a healthy person. She said people talk about hormones changes after when a person used to have a period, and she sometimes doesn&#39;t know if her pain would be because of that. She said she may have irritation in her breasts from wearing a bra that may be too tight, but the pain she was experiencing now was different from that pain. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of the events she can&#39;t sleep in the heat at night and feeling a little down and out was unknown; and not recovered outcome for the other events.

Right hand dominant but use left hand a great deal. Dropped everything I lifted or put in my left hand. Light or heavy. Embarrassed at first, then concerned. Stopped at pharmacy to pick up unrelated med and mentioned to pharmacist. We both laughed. Returned home and told husband. It continued.  Later started feeling numbness in fingers and hand on left sixths left leg and numbness and tingling up left neck and face and scalp.  Lasted 30 min to an hour. Weakness in hand got better over days .  Waited until recently to report it to Anyone and chose Dr as he follows me for other issues and I have a second dose due and became frightened.

                                                beginning with itchy soles of my feet and both palms, and progressing through the day with the addition of grotesquely swollen knees and hives on legs, arms, and a few on my back. The hives presented as large welts all very itchy. I applied Calamine lotion and took a Loratadine pill, and the hives and itch subsided dramatically. I also developed flu-like symptoms of malaise and wheezing. At no time did I have a fever nor did my throat swell or close. Saturday, 24 hours after the first Loratadine pill, the hives and swelling reappeared but disappeared within 15 minutes of taking another Loratadine pill. Sunday through today, the swollen knees and wheeze remain but diminished in severity

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fever, being ill (deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks) and bug bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient is the type of person that takes a lot for her to take medications. She is allergic to a lot of things; she always has crazy reactions. She can&#39;t take morphine. It took her 7 pills to get the right one for high blood pressure. She has the craziest one-day reactions.  She received the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday much against her will, knowing she had COVID but not diagnosed in March. She had a fever, she was deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks. She had a nasal swab done and it came back negative. She doesn&#39;t think that was right, she believes she had COVID-19 in Mar2020. Her daughter is younger, and she had the same thing, she couldn&#39;t breathe good for 3 weeks. She had pneumonia. She knows she had COVID-19. She was trying to lose weight. She was given her first COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor. Everything was going okay at first. About an hour and a half later, she became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness. She can&#39;t describe it. She has never taken drugs. She doesn&#39;t drink alcohol at all. She has like a virgin body. She states plus she is red headed, which it is known red heads have a harder time with medication. As the day goes on, she just felt lightheaded all the rest of the day. The next day (Sunday, 31Jan2021), she wakes up and it hits her like a ton of bricks. She woke in the morning and seemed to be okay and then it was like she was pregnant and blew up. She started cramping really bad and had gas. Everybody has gas. She was a little nauseated as well. She experienced lots of indigestion, cramping in her stomach like she was going to have a baby or the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot. She had a little bit of nausea. She had nausea pills because she had a gallbladder taken out and she took nausea pills for 2-3 days. She didn&#39;t take any medication for any of these symptoms she started to experience on Sunday. However, she did start popping Gas-X. She was taking two Gas-X every 3 or 4 hours. The caller states it helped. She had lots of gas; gas was just coming out of her bottom. She had the gas, cramps, her stomach hurt. She was able to get through it, which that is good. Then Monday, 01Feb2021 was the day she had weird things happen to her that she was kind of concerned about. Her muscles started to draw, that is the best way she can describe it. Her feet would just draw up weird. Her arms and hands would do crazy things and contort or draw up. This hurts because the muscles are like a rubber band pulling. It was weird, and she didn&#39;t like it. It wasn&#39;t like when she has a horse and has to get up and stand, it wasn&#39;t like that at all. Her muscles were tightening up like a rubber band. Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening. She thought to herself, &#34;what is this Parkinson&#39;s?&#34;. She doesn&#39;t even know. She still has some stomach issues, but it is easing up. The gas is still coming out. It wasn&#39;t debilitating or anything. She has some minor nausea. What scared her more was the muscle cramping and pulling. Her toes would contort and go backwards. The muscle tightness occurred yesterday, 01Feb2021. It happened all day and was sporadic. Her toes moved in a different way like a rubber band pulling on muscle. Nothing has happened today. Everything was yesterday. Her whole body basically was affected, just different sections at different times. Today, she feels like the left arm is going to do something, it&#39;s like the last to be pulled. Her hands and fingers stayed the same. She explains like the upper arm area from her elbow to her shoulder part. She can&#39;t even think of what that area is, but it&#39;s the part between her elbow and shoulder. She has been doing lots of exercises and moving, hoping the part of her elbow to her should don&#39;t atrophy or won&#39;t pull. She hasn&#39;t told anybody about it. She doesn&#39;t like it. It was very frightening. She is scheduled for her second shot and she is scared to death to go back. She mentions her nerves are shot. From stress, she had previously broken out instantly. She thought it was a bug biting her. She never had gone to the doctor but after about 4 weeks, she thought she had these horrible bug bites. She was shaking her clothes and she almost wanted to strip it was so bad. She thought it was severe bug bites. She couldn&#39;t figure it out. She finally went to the doctor after a week. It was a Saturday. The doctor told her it was shingles. Explained that it itches a lot. She went on medication. She clarifies she went on acyclovir 800mg, three pills a day. She called her doctor knowing that she had shingles and how scared she is with medicine, the doctor assured her she could get the COVID-19 shot as scheduled. The medicine for shingles (acyclovir) was finished up the Friday before she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shingles shot at 60 but everybody is now saying to get the new shot for shingles which she has never done obviously since she got the shingles. She plans to get the shingles shot in the summer. She is not worried about it. She took 3 pills a day and that was fine. She is fine, meaning every day she did normal things going through the whole process. She states she plans to go to the bank. She asked if anybody has reported the reaction she experienced after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. She received the first dose of the vaccine last Saturday, in which within an hour and a half her &#34;brain got weird, like a psychedelic feeling and it felt like I was getting an injection in the operating room to go to sleep.&#34; On Monday she experienced, &#34;horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band.&#34; Stated that it wasn&#39;t a horse feeling. Her hands and fingers would pull and contort in different positions, in which they would remain tight and stay in that position, and then she would be able to make a closed fist. On Monday night, her left arm contorted (which is not administration arm) and her muscle became really tight from her elbow to her wrist leading to her hand contorting as well. She describes the muscle tension as if a rubber band was being pulled, it would have burst. This muscle pulling hurt, in which she took 3 ibuprofen (ADVIL). She has crazy reactions with almost anything that she takes. She has never smoked or drank. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19: unknown on an unspecified date and unknown on Mar2020, SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of gas (flatulence), muscles became tight/contort, minor nausea, horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band and shingles. The outcome of the event &#39;the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot&#39; was not recovered while of the rest of the events was unknown.

Morning after chills, neck stiffness, pain back of head left side. Applied heating pad to neck. By late morning I was nauseous , and weak as a kitten. Took a 500 mg Tylenol and slept for about 4 hours. Woke up in a sweat but chills gone and am now able to eat a little bit. Back of head and neck still very sore.   The injection site is sore but no rash; right arm seems to have &#34;phantom pain&#34; as well ( I experienced this with Shingles shot in December 2020 too).

                                                On Feb. 12th at 2PM symptoms started with lower back pain, pain in abdomen and stomach, cramping, chills, ear ache, pain level 8.  Felt sick all over, like having the flu and then whole body ached, not just GI track.  Left arm injection site was red, sore to touch, swollen (slightly).  Doctor couldn&#39;t get vaccination needle into arm muscle the first time and so had to try a second time.   Intense cramping of GI track started up again 8:45AM on Feb. 13th.   By 4PM Feb. 15th fever 102F, chills, felt freezing cold and had to wrap myself in a heating blanket.  Pain level 10, especially in pancreas. Fever broke around 2:30AM Feb. 16th and later when I was up at 8AM I felt very weak, faint, pancreas ached.  Pancreatic pain lasted another 3 days.  Pancreatic pain stayed around level 5.  On Feb. 17th took ibuprophen.  Pain level reduced to 1.   This was the only time that I took pain medication between Feb. 10th and 17th, because I am conservative about using Ibuprophen, Tylenol, and have a high threshold for pain.

                                                Tingling of fingers and numbness of left cheek.  Did not get any worse after 30 minutes. Extremely tired and sore arm that day.  Day 2 - tired easily, no stamina.  Dizzy and nauseous after showering at3:30 pm.  By 10:30, both hands were red and itched.  Sometime in the night woke with a very sharp, painful headache.  Did not last.  No real problem again until Saturday.  Nausea at 11:20 am.  Sunday I sat all day doing taxes - no symptoms noted.  Monday after walking - rapid heart rate and very tired after what is normal activity.  By 4:30 I was tingling all over my body.  Tuesday night my ankles are swollen for the first time in years.  Only happened that nigh.  Wednesday morning, the tingling is very strong in my calves. and I had a sharp pain in the area of my Achilles tendon.  I believe that the vaccine has exacerbated the neuropathy (undiagnosed) of the bottom of my feet.  Today I am reporting because I fell for no reason getting out of a chair, and the tingling is in my legs, arms, shoulders.  I had not heard until today that the vaccine could affect the nervous system.  The effects are the worst they have been and it has been one week since I had the vaccine.  Should I get the second shot?  Due March 11,2021.

                                                Slightly elevated temp, mild nausea, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, mild headache. All this started 6 days after the vaccine. On the 6th night  after the shot, symptoms lasted about 8 hours. Then started up worse during the night of  the 7th day, especially the chills, elevated temp, fatigue  and nausea. Symptoms such as the chills are starting to subside about 10 hours later but some such as mild fatigue still remain. Is this normal for symptoms to show up nearly a week after the shot?

A 73-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included medroxyprogesterone and estradiol. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization (got the first shot exactly 3 weeks before for which the patient was not sure of the date). On 01Feb2021, just shortly after the patient and his husband both got the shot, the patient had sore arms by the time they drove home yesterday afternoon. The patient&#39;s sore arm was much better today but it was still just little tender - that is the only thing she had. Currently (02Feb2021), the patient&#39;s arm was slightly stiff still, just the muscle is slightly sore. No treatment was taken for the adverse events. The patient was recovering from &#34;Sore arms; just little tender&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

A 73-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EL9264) via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 12:45PM at a single dose on top of left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was given at a Clinic which is an off shoot of the hospital. The patient did not receive any vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162B2. Medical history included Wegner&#39;s disease, immune issues and stress. She stated that there would be one doctor providing medication for stress and other doctor providing other medications. She has immune issues and stress. Concomitant medications included buspirone from an unspecified date and ongoing (been on it for quite a few years), clonazepam from an unspecified date and ongoing (been on it for quite a few years), fluticasone propionate (FLOVENT) from an unspecified date and ongoing (been on it a little over a year or two and it was prescribed by her pulmonologist), hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene (TRIAMTERENE AND HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) from an unspecified date and ongoing (has been on it for more than 5 years and was prescribed by her primary care), methylprednisolone for immune issues, bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and nebulizer for saline for Wegner&#39;s disease (It is prescribed by her ear, nose, and throat doctor). The patient previously received a flu shot in 2020 and experienced sore arm and achy feeling. On 01Feb2021 18:45, the patient experienced severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and pain in the base of her skull. A lot of people thought it was throwing her into a migraine. She has never had a migraine in her life. It was awful and pretty extreme. Severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and pain in the base of her skull started about six hours after the shot (at 18:45) and proceed a good 24 hours later. She also had pain at the top of her spine where the spine meets the skull. She would say that the symptoms stopped on 02Feb2021. She has recovered almost completely. She is still not quite completely 100 percent. The reported adverse events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Some relatives said she should have gone in, but she did not. Outcome of the events was recovered on 02Feb2021.

                                                Very next MORNING!  My blood sugar readings every morning had been running @ 100 .   HOWEVER, next morning after Covid shot, my blood sugar was 350.   It continued that way for days.  I started using more insulin the night before (when I usually take it).   So I HAD been taking only 45 units at night.  I was cautious and increased to 65 units on the 3rd night.  That reduced my morning blood sugar readings to 220.   Per my doctor&#39;s instructions, I have been taking that amount every night, but my blood sugar has only gone down to 175.   This was my MAIN concern.  But here are the other physical effects that have occurred since 2-25:  great thirst, Joints hurt, teeth hurt, confusion, headache, fatigue, sleeping almost all day - all of these days since the shot.  Something new started just last night (3-7-2021).   Both of my  legs hurt so much I could not fall asleep.  They still hurt this morning.  My joints ache in my hips, knees - Much worse than they normally do.

                                                The next day after the injection, my knees were so sore that I could not walk and I was not sure they would hold me up.  It felt like the bones were rubbing against each other. (I have strong knees, and have never had any problem with them. ) Advil relieved the pain immediately. I slept at night with a heating pad on them, which helped.  This week, March 12, I am finally able to walk without pain or  wrapping my knees with ace bandages.  They are still not ?normal?.  I may have strained them in a  3-ft snow drift on Feb. 4, but I had no indication they were hurt at the time.    I have had sprained ankles and recently broke my leg.  The pain in my knees was like nothing I have endured so far...it?s onset was immediate.

She had her second shot today and she was trying to explain to the doctor what happen to the right shoulder. He said the shot had to be in the other shoulder and he put it in the left shoulder in the bone. It hit the bone. She hollered because it hurt so bad. He said no one ever jumped like that before. She jumped because it hurt. She still has the pain in the right shoulder, but she doesn&#39;t feel anything in the left where she got it today. She clarified Pfizer shot as COVID19 vaccine.

Pain over heart area: It started at the same time as with the pain in the right shoulder. The pain over the heart stopped about a week ago. She thinks she has recovered completely.

                                                Flare/hands, wrists and elbows were painful; This is a solicited report from a non-Pfizer sponsored program from a contactable consumer, based on information received by Pfizer, license party for etanercept (ENBREL).   This serious solicited report was reported to Amgen on 19Apr2021 by a consumer from a commercial program  and involves a 73 year old female patient who had a flare/hands, wrists and elbows were painful [PT: rheumatoid arthritis] while receiving Enbrel, Single Dose Prefilled Syringe.

No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.   Follow-up (19Apr2021): This is a follow-up solicited report from a non-Pfizer sponsored program , based on information received by Pfizer from Amgen, license party for etanercept (ENBREL).   Correction Dated 19Apr2021: Version created to update covid-19 vaccine from concomitant medication to co-suspect medication as it was more likely associated with reported event rheumatoid arthritis.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events with the suspect product etanercept was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.

Also add headache could not hardly stand to lay my head on the pillow. About 4 AM I could not tolerate the situation any longer and took 600 mg of Tylenol. After that was able to rest some. The next day after the vaccination my joints were achy moderately and I have a headache. The injection site was tender to the touch and arm range of motion decreased and arm sore. Took 400 ibuprofen about 4 PM day after injection to ease Reactions

                                                On 1/20/21 I had the 1st Covid 19 vaccine in my left arm at 1:10pm and at exactly 9:00pm that evening I experienced a pain on my right side that went along the outside starting at the base of my little toe and continuing to the heel of my foot and from there going right on up the outside of my right leg to the base of my hip.  At  this point I laid down which made the pain a little better.  I tried rubbing the area  but that didn&#34;t help much.   I did take one advil an hour before bedtime but the moderate pain stayed the same.  At midnight I went to bed and was able to sleep.  By morning I was fine.

                                                Pain (level 4 of 10) starting in right rear of neck, becoming more intense on 01/19/21. By evening head movement was very difficult, I could not sleep in bed that night. I slept on the couch sitting up trying to immobilize head. During the night pain spread into the base of my skull. I applied heat to help relieve the pain and tightness. On 01/20/21 the pain (6 of 10) spread into the left side of neck and skull, it became difficult to eat, swallow and to get up from couch. I tried to sit motionless most of the day. On 01/21/21 the pain (6 of !0) moved down into my left rear shoulder, I continued to apply heat and immobilize sitting on couch, eating and swallowing still difficult. On 01/22/21 pain in neck and base of Additional information for Item 18:  skull subside to level 5, movement of head still difficult, able to to get up and move slowly. Could not lift head to drink, still needed to use straw. Slept on couch again this night. On 01/23/21 pain still subsiding to level 4, head movement still difficult, still needed straw to drink, slept on couch again. On 01/24/21 pain continuing to subside to level 3, head movement still difficult, still needed straw to drink, slept on couch again. On 01/25/21 conditions unchanged. On 1/26/21 pain subsided to level 2, head movement stiff but not difficult, swallowing less difficult but still need straw to drink. Slept in bed for first time since 01/19/21. On 01/27/21 pain continued to subside to level 1, head movement improved but still limited, still need straw to drink, able to move around more freely but still not normal. Improvement is slow but I hope to be back to normal in a few days. I am concerned that my second vaccination may cause a more severe reaction, please have someone call or contact me so I can discuss this issue.

Could not get out of bed or bend over without supporting my head with my hands. Sought chiropractic and massage therapies on the 7th and 8th days. Beginning to get better, but still hurts. I can&#39;t say for certain that the vaccine caused this, but since I was not in an accident and had not fallen, I can&#39;t find another reason to have had such an excruciating condition.

Historical vaccine included two doses of shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) for Immunization and experienced shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain after the vaccine. The patient experienced bad headache (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, Severe shaking chills (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, muscles and joints ached (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, couldn&#39;t hold a cup to drink on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, painful bilateral lower back pain on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, cough/dry cough on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of not recovered (reported as worsened), strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, taste started to diminish on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, pharangitis on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, couldn&#39;t get warm on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the patient received the COVIED in the morning of 20Jan2021. By 5pm she had developed a headache, severe shaking, chills, muscle and joints pain, severe lower back pain, and a dry cough; she was miserable. A few years ago after her double dosing of the shingles vaccine she had a similar reaction of shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain. She has no product details for that product, no NDC, Lot, or expiry to provide. The patient confirmed that the shingles shot was 2 doses, not a double dose given at one time. When asked a seriousness criteria it was explained that the symptoms that started on the 20th, she felt they were disabling. She couldn&#39;t get warm, stop shaking, couldn&#39;t hold a cup and the pain was severe and she has high tolerance for pain. By around 3pm that day on the 21Jan2021 everything but the dry cough had resolved, and that had gotten worse. She also developed new symptoms. She had strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic and her sense of taste started to diminish. She did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017, She has no product information, NDC, Lot or Expiry for that radiation but after that she did have taste, some of it did come back. On the 21Jan2021, it was less, the sense of taste and now today she has no taste at all. For the muscle and joint pain she took Aleve. She was told if she was feeling worse over the weekend to go to the ER or urgent care. The patient was wondering and thinking this was her normal response to the vaccine just like she had a normal response that shingles vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

She says she was told to see if anyone else reported this, she expected normal stuff like, flu stuff, this is not that. She says she is on her way to urgent care to have that looked at. She asks if condition persists, she is supposed to get her second dose on 12Feb, does she get it? She got her first dose last Friday (22Jan2021) then woke up Saturday and can&#39;t lift or pull anything and it really, really hurts. She says to add to this, which she talked to two doctors (docs) who said it was unrelated, that night she had a cut to the top of the roof of her mouth that had uncontrollable bleeding, she went to the emergency room for that and got a shot to help her coagulate blood, and will be seeing an ENT so hopefully that will be under control. No further details provided about shot to help her coagulate blood. She got the flu shot but that was Thanksgiving, way back, not recent. She is going to get her sinuses checked out, they did a CAT scan yesterday, and is going to the doctor for that 1Feb. She is concerned that the breast pain started last Saturday and is still really painful, she doesn&#39;t know why all of a sudden that happened, so she is going to the urgent care to see if they can do something for it, and will be getting an appointment with her OBGYN.

A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included dental work/specifying a tooth being pulled and an implant (an antibiotic (Amoxicillin)) was used and shingles (7 years ago). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that Pharmacist had some left over in the vial and gave the patient on 28Jan2021. Patient wanted to make sure it was ok. Patient stated &#34;she got shingles on her face, 7 years ago, and had recent dental work done,&#34; specifying a tooth being pulled and an implant. She stated she received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine last Thursday evening (28Jan2021). On 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 (friday and saturday), she mentioned, her &#34;arm was a little sore&#34;. On 30Jan2021 and 31Jan2021 (saturday evening and sunday morning) she said her &#34;upper back started hurting&#34; and thought &#34;maybe [she] sat on the couch for too long&#34;. On 31Jan2021 (Sunday evening), she added her &#34;back was very tender and sensitive around the spine area&#34; therefore, she &#34;took some tylenol and used a heating pad thinking [she] pulled a muscle&#34;. On 01Feb2021 (By Monday) she said her &#34;the back and front were very sensitive&#34; to the point where: when she &#34;touched [her] skin it felt like [she] was touching some live nerves&#34;. She explained seeing a physician assistant who &#34;couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on&#34; and since it seemed to be getting worst, she thought she could possibly have Shingles. She continued saying she then &#34;went to see an orthopedic doctor who took x-rays and said he doesn&#39;t see anything, and it may be the beginning phases of Shingles&#34;. She mentioned she has an appointment with her internist today at 4:20. She later mentioned her &#34;brother, who is a doctor, thinks [she] has post traumatic neuralgia&#34; related to her shingles on an unspecified date in Jan2021. She then added there is &#34;still a part of her forehead that feels like a live nerve&#34; to touch, since having Shingles, on 01Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.  The information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reported muscle tightness up through her left shoulder into her neck. She was extremely anxious. Her initial blood pressure was 190/100. She reported being extremely scared of coming to the clinic today for the vaccine and that she got no sleep the night before. We talked extensively and I tried to get her mind thinking about anything else possible. Repeated her BP after a time and it was 142/82. Once her required 15 minute observation was over, she requested to leave, because  part of her apprehension was just being there. Her neck tightness has subsided.

                                                At 10am on Thursday February 25, I SUDDENLY experienced the onset of violent chills, shaking so hard I couldn&#39;t initially place a thermomenter in my mouth.  Moments later, this was accompanied by throbbing pain in my lower back.  Eventually I was able to take my temperature and I had fever.  My daughter contacted my primry care physician who told us to go the emergency room. By the time we went to hospital, the chills had stopped as well as the lower back pain. I was quarantined (though they knew I had been vaccinated for COVID) until they tested me for COVID, the test came back negative in an hour.  They did a number of tests and I was discharged around 6:00 pm that evening

She had no temperature, a little headache on 31Jan2021 at the back of the head and tired, very tired, she was tired from 29Jan2021, and was better from 01Feb2021. She took paracetamol last night, and cold compress. she used to take baby aspirin; she didn&#39;t know if it would be a problem. She read not to take paracetamol or ibuprofen before vaccination. She felt tugging and redness when she raised her arm, it was not red its blotchy. She didn&#39; t feel any swelling. The last 7 to 8 months, she was running high blood counts, 12.3 (high) and she had no infection, her doctor was a little nervous, the last one on 15Jan2021, it was down to 10.2 within normal range. Her immune system was very active. She had a flu shot in Oct2018 at age of 72 y/o and by 08Jun months later, she got the flu. She went to the hospital and developed PNA. In 2019 and again this past Aug2020, she had a Colonoscopy where they removed polyps. She had a flat polyp that was a little more dangerous the first time and it was removed. It was non-cancerous. The doctor was just watching it. Last blood results were 2 weeks prior to having first shot on 15Jan2021. The only thing that showed was her Liver enzymes were a little elevated. She was told that if she hadn&#39;t gotten the vaccine, it would have been worse, her doctor gave me the zpack. They were calling it a subcutaneous sensitivity, she had eczema, she forgot to mention that. She was taking calcium 1200mg, she forgot to tell her that also. The outcome of events pain in arm, redness and feeling hot was not recovered; of events tiredness, body temperature increased, itching and headache was recovering; of rest events was unknown.

A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 15:30 in left arm at single dose as Covid vaccine, etanercept (ENBREL, 50 mL/mg, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen, lot number: 1119808, expiry date: Apr2023) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 DF weekly to the stomach area for rheumatoid arthritis, methylprednisolone (MEDROL, tablet) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 3 mg, daily (1.5 tablets daily for total of 3 mg) for rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate (tablets) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 20 mg, weekly (2.5 mg tablets, 20 mg total) for rheumatoid arthritis. Medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity) and took levothyroxine, rheumatoid arthritis. She had had regular blood work for rheumatoid arthritis and that was normal for her, they were relatively normal and her ESR was down. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included levothyroxine daily for endocrine abnormalities. It was a daily thing for the body and the body couldn&#39;t live without it if it did not have it. The patient previously took the Shingrix vaccine and it was terrible for her and put her into a rheumatoid arthritis flare and was taking prednisone and was getting better and the wap she was in a rheumatoid flare. No prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient was taking 3 medicines for rheumatoid arthritis that might or might not affect the RNA in the vaccine. She wondered if etanercept would have an effect on the vaccine since it was shipped on ice overnight. She did not think they would affect anything. Nobody has said anything about the medications and she just wanted to get the vaccine. Her doctor knows nothing about the interactions and none of them seem to know if it is normal to have these symptoms 4 days after getting the vaccine. She felt great the first 2 days after getting the vaccine and then began to feel a little bad. She was having some symptoms maybe 4 days on 01Feb2021 after receiving the Covid vaccine and wanted to know if that was sort of normal. It was unusual for her, but she had nauseous, not dizziness, but unsteadiness, tired, also headaches and generally didn&#39;t feel well. She felt like she might have the stomach flu, but had not had that in so many years. She also felt weak. No temperature. Gentle muscle ache. On 01Feb2021 Monday night she had the nausea. On 02Feb2021 Tuesday, she had it again, and had it again today and almost threw up last night. Just the malaise or tiredness had gotten worse. She could not tell the difference between the rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain and muscle pain and this with the vaccine. She was having a few little odd pains, but nothing that she hadn&#39;t had before. It was more of a soft pain, they made her feel weak and then they went away. It was more muscle than joint. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was supposed to get a second dose but felt she shouldn&#39;t, it might put her back into a rheumatoid flare. She was just getting over it and afraid to go through that with the Covid vaccine also. The action taken in response to the events for etanercept, methylprednisolone and methotrexate was dose not changed. The outcome of events nausea, unsteadiness, tired (tired was reported as worsened), generally does not feel well, feels like the stomach flu, weak, few little odd pains; soft pain, joint pain was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

                                                11:00 pm - ish: Site of injection began burning which became more intense throughout the night. Cold sweats, severe aching and muscle weakness especially in legs, nauseous, severe headache. I tried to drink a little water. Didn&#39;t have enough energy and was too cold to get up to  get any medication. Slept a little. I was awake early in the morning, but too cold to get out of bed. At 8:30 a.m. I got up and could hardly walk. Dizzy, muscle weakness as if muscles had turned to Jell-O.. Sat down and threw up, mostly dry heaves, which lasted a few minutes. Fitful sleep until 11:00 a.m. when I began to feel better. Drank more water and just rested for a few hours. I ate some applesauce and made a batch of white rice which I ate around 6:00 p.m. Achiness in lower extremities continued until bedtime (10:00 p.m.) when I took a Meloxicam (15 mg) which my GP prescribed for achiness in my neck due to arthritis. I take this drug only when needed and thought it would help the aching in my legs. Maybe it did...maybe it was a coincidence that the achiness was alleviated enough for me to go to sleep. I am almost 100% today. It takes a little longer at my age to fully recover from any illness however slight. I would like to add that I am grateful to be vaccinated.

Pain in left upper leg with loss of strength in leg and could not lift leg up.  The pain and discomfort in my back started to subside after 5-7 days.  Today (day 10) the pain is gone from my hip. I still have weakness and discomfort in my left leg. Saw my M.D. today and will start physical therapy for the leg. Also first day not needing to take Tylenol which did not effect the pain at all for the first week.

Placed bag of ice under left knee/lower leg to decrease pain/swelling for 20 minutes. Removed ice and wrapped a heating pad around left knee and went to bed for approx. 11 hours. Awoke at 0230 and almost fell to floor because left leg and knee was very swollen and painful. Left arm was swollen from upper arm to wrist. Whole face also appeared swollen. Denied redness and hardness. Went back to bed and awoke at 0930 - took two Tylenol for left arm soreness where injection was. Swelling slowly subsided throughout the day and she stated that she felt so much better in am of 3/5/2021 (Friday).

Went to bed, and woke up and her arm is swollen, it&#39;s like she has a frozen shoulder, is pounding pain, extremely tight, difficult to move, can&#39;t move it, and very constricted which prevents her from using it.   The pain goes all the way down to her elbow.  She cannot use the left hand, and when she tries to move her arm at the elbow has excruciating pain.   She took 2 Tylenol which helped, but the pain comes back when it&#39;s time for more Tylenol and is also taking Ibuprofen but the symptoms are still there.  Just to lift her arm up to put on the arms of a chair is painful with no mobility in the arm.

The 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine was due on 02/17/2021, pt had to cancel 2nd dose appointment due to Clinic appointment.

Pt will receive oncology treatment 03/29/2021, the oncologist alerted the caller the 2nd dose must be administered to the pt before oncologic treatment. Caller asked if the pt should get the second dose due to the kidney failure occurring after the 1st dose was administered. Currently pt is only experiencing lower back pain. Pt was advised that it is unlikely the vaccine caused kidney failure and the pt should get the second dose as soon as possible. SPI was consulted and Dr. was notified.

The third day my injection sites pain went further to my left breast, up to my shoulder.  It had spread and was now a light pink.  A small amount of dizziness.

A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 03Mar2021 (at the age of 74 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lumbar spine infusion (operations on spinal cord) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient needed the call handler to speak slowly, she doesn&#39;t feel that well. She had the first dose of BNT162B2 last 03Mar2021 and the second dose will be on 23Mar2021. She said something was happening to her arm but it was not where the needle went in, that is not where it is. It hurt there at where the needle went in, in the beginning but now it hurts down toward the elbow and it penetrates through the epidermis, endodermis and the muscle and feels like it&#39;s at the bone. She hopes it was not a blood clot. She has been looking at the website and they say people could have blood clots and she does not know if this was a blood clot, she can&#39;t hardly lift her arm, it was the left side that the shot was in because her right side is partially paralyzed due to effect of lumbar spine infusion and so when she tried to get up sometimes she can hardly lift that arm and so she didn&#39;t know what to do if she should call the primary care doctor to see if she has a clot but she read it and it says to call this number if you are having compactions and she been on hold over and hour and a half. It was hurting and the feeling like she couldn&#39;t hardly raise the arm or get any kind of strength in it. She knew in Europe they have had few people who have had blood clots, and she thought could that be a sign of a blood, like blood not moving through her veins like it is supposed to. It is not moving it has not made it to her heart yet. She says it is associated with the product, this is the only thing she has had in her arm she knows it is the product. She said her birthday just passed. She turned 75 years old but when the issue started in her arm she was 74 years old. It did not start the first week, the first week it was just sore around where the shot went in but then last week it started happening where it was hurting down her arm and she was getting close to the second shot which she doubts she will have but it is the 23rd which is next week. She used to be 5&#39;2&#34; but the operations on her spinal cord, she guesses she might be 4&#39;&#39;10 now. She does not know because she can&#39;t hold her head up straight because the doctor that fused it, she indented it instead of it being more out and because of that her head is forward and down. It was also reported that she hasn&#39;t been to the doctor she only goes to pain management for him to check out her body and everything and renew prescriptions. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 74-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose at the age of 74-years-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 05Mar2021 15:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included anal cancer (h/o anal cancers/p chemo &amp; RT2013), hypertension, hypothyroidism and new fe deficiency anemia dx during this admit from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient has known allergies to Ampicillin, clindamycin, trilafon, imipramine. The patient reported that 4.5 days after 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine on morning of 10Mar2021 09:00, the patient woke up with shaking chills, severe headache, right mid and low back pain, high fever up to 103 degrees within 1/2 hr of onset and not able to get out of bed except to get to nearby bathroom to use toilet when needed. The patient took Tylenol 500 mg up to 5 doses by 10:00 am of 11Mar2021 when fever would not abate; the patient was weak and lightheaded on an unspecified date and since lived alone called a number to take her to ER. On an unspecified date, her blood pressure was low 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s over 40&#39;s to 50&#39;s all thru night and 1000 more mg of Tylenol was given at 4:00 am and fever then lowered to 99 or 100. Full infectious work up negative for bacterial sources including abdominal and pelvic cat scan, abdominal ultrasound, CXR, urine culture, she received 2 1/2 liters of IV fluid and IV Ceftriaxone and Flagyl in ER. In case bacterial cause which was not found including blood cultures, due to her BP still not improved by 5:00 am as she was dehydrated prior to this admit, she was admitted on medicine floor for 2 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included abdomen scan: unknown result on an unspecified date, blood pressure measurement: low 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s over 40&#39;s to 50&#39;s all thru night on an unspecified date; still not improved on an unspecified date, body temperature: high fever up to 103 degrees on 10Mar2021; 99 or 100 on an unspecified date, chest x-ray: unknown result on an unspecified date, culture urine: unknown result on an unspecified date, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 10Mar2021, ultrasound abdomen: unknown result on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included IV, fluids, 1 dose of 2 different IV antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Flagyl) and Tylenol. The patient was recovering from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

March 10, 2021:  Patient received 2nd dose of PfizerBioNTech vaccine at 1:10pm.  Said she had mild chest tightness during the waiting period and used her Ventolin but she attributed it to the characteristics of the waiting room area.

Heart rate 132 and regular.  Patient treated with Levalbuterol 1.25 mg nebulization with subsequent modest improvement in frequency of cough, pulse 102, oxygen saturation 96-97%.  She declined going to emergency department of hospital because she did not want to get infected with COVID-19 from a patient in the waiting room.  She declined Prednisone when told that the corticosteroid might reduce the efficacy of the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  Placed on Budesonide 1 mg bid and Levalbuterol 1.25 mg q4-6h prn. March 16th:  Patient reported her cough was 70% improved and wanted to stop Budesonide.  Patient was told to continue Budesonide daily at 1 mg q day.

Other medical conditions: Consumer stated, Folic acid, sodium bicarbonate, yes the Soda Bicarb (sodium bicarbonate) is for the Phase 3 renal disease but numbers are good, my DE creatinine all was normal but my nephrologist who happened to be a friend of mine said stage 3 renal disease. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole (AGGRENOX) taken for antiplatelet therapy, and paracetamol (TYLENOL) taken for pain. Concomitant medication: Consumer stated, &#34;I take lots of medication, I mean I take Tylenol but none these have a direct correlation to the, I take Aggrenox, Aggrenox is antiplatelet, oh you are a pharmacist so you know that, that&#39;s Persantin and aspirin that&#39;s the combo, its antiplatelet.&#34; Patient has no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient previously took clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) and experienced bruising; folic acid, and Soda Bicarb (sodium bicarbonate) for phase 3 renal disease. Patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EN6203, expiry date: 30Jun2021, on 28Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunization. It was given in her left arm. She received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Sunday (21Mar2021). Her arm became sore on 21Mar2021. On Wednesday (24Mar2021), she was unable to raise her arm even in the shower. She saw her doctor on Thursday because she is on a statin and had aches and pain in her legs. They drew blood and found that she has an elevated CPK on 26Mar2021. It is not grossly but is elevated and has had muscle trauma. Could there be a connection? She reduced the statin to three times a week. The arm soreness is 30-40% improved. She can move her arm away from her body. It felt like she hit her elbow in the funny bone. It was an odd feeling down to her fingertips. The vaccine card indicates the vaccine was given in her right deltoid but it was given in her left deltoid (Left arm). She clarified that she is taking Rosuvastatin Calcium instead of Crestor. She added that she has Stage 3 Kidney Disease. The Nephrologist had told her that she needed to take Rosuvastatin Calcium 7 days a week instead of three. She has only had the pain since she started taking it daily. She stopped taking it daily this past Monday night. She told her doctor she will be taking it only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Consumer further stated, she had a very sore arm that she cannot lift over her hand, it feels like somebody hit her elbow. Consumer further reported and stated that she had the Pfizer second vaccine on Sunday (21Mar2021), by Wednesday (24Mar2021), she could not lift her arm, she went to her doctor yesterday and she was a nurse for 54 years so she did not think that was big deal, vaccine do give you a sore arm. However, she drew blood, well she didn&#39;t, the technician drew blood in that arm and her CPK is elevated, Patient stated &#34;am I speaking to a pharmacist, doctor or, okay CPK indicated some kind of damage either to heart muscles to the brain or some skeletal muscle on the body. Mine has never been elevated, it&#39;s not growth fully elevated like indicative of cardiac event, However, it is elevated so I thought I should report this to Pfizer so I want you to know that, this is unusual finding.&#34; She was on a statin drug, she was on Crestor 5 mg once a day (clarified that she is taking Rosuvastatin Calcium instead of Crestor), however she cut it back to just 3 times a week now because her cholesterol numbers are good, my LDL and HDL are all good and the Cholesterol drug (Intent: Crestor) is known to cause this muscle aches and pain but this is so coincidental with this arm, her left arm where she received vaccine and this CPK being elevated and she thought perhaps Pfizer should be made aware. Consumer stated, &#34;I have been a nurse, I am retired now, I am 76 but I had been a nurse for 54 years, I was at one time director of nursing, so I am familiar with the healthcare system and most medications but of course this Pfizer vaccine and Moderna and Johnson and Johnson these are brand new, this is a Covid pandemic so. Causality: Consumer stated, I kind of think there is connection there sir, because remember that it could be, muscle damage that elevates your CPK, it could be cardiac muscle, it could be a stroke, neither which I didn&#39;t have a heart attack. I was having a lot of muscle pain, prior because of the Crestor but that is the common side effect of any statin drug can cause muscle aches and pains. However, I thought there was quite a connection getting the vaccine in the right arm, not being able to raise my (incomplete sentence) now vaccine was Sunday which was I believe the 21st and this event did not happen until, I was sore Sunday evening but the unable to raise it was Wednesday, which was 3 days later yeah and the blood draw was yesterday morning and this morning my doctor called me to tell me that my CPK was elevated not grossly but enough to make the phone call. Consumer stated, the first one was on 28Feb2021 and the lot number was EN620, I need my magnify glass, there is one right here because it&#39;s so small, okay its EN62C or is it 0, it&#39;s hard to tell 3 is the last number. The second dose with lot number is EP7534. Consumer stated, Let me just look at the calendar to make sure that was Wednesday, I got the shot on 21st, yes sir, it was the 24th, the arm was sore even that evening the 21st (21Mar2021), evening of the 21st but the inability to move it was Wednesday the 24th, I could not move even move it away from my body so I was guarding it, today it&#39;s not as bad, I can move it but I still feel it like up in my shoulder. When confirmed if the event has improved, consumer stated, I would say yes but not totally gone. Consumer stated, I just took Tylenol that&#39;s all, I mean what I was going to do, I think I took, I know I took a shower last night Wednesday at night, I might let the warm water run on it, I might have, I don&#39;t remember, I took a shower regardless so.&#34; Lab test: Consumer stated, &#34;I had blood work yesterday all my values were normal, Cholesterol was normal the only thing that was elevated was the CPK.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;I thought that it was necessary to report it okay, is there any way you can tell me is this a common occurrence where CPK elevates slightly.&#34; The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable and for rosuvastatin calcium was dose reduced. The outcome of the events &#39;arm became sore, unable to raise arm, elevated CPK and muscle trauma (muscle injury)&#39; was recovering while the outcome of the other event was unknown. The reporter considered the events &#39;arm soreness, unable to raise arm and elevated CPK&#39; as serious (medically significant). The causality of the events &#39;arm soreness and unable to raise arm&#39; was related to BNT162B2, and event &#39;elevated CPK&#39; was related to rosuvastatin calcium.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a drug event temporal association, the company cannot completely rule out a reasonable possibility that BNT162B2 caused the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 75-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 13:45 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension and atrial fibrillation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included benazepril (BENAZEPRIL), diltiazem (DILTIAZEM), rivaroxaban (XARELTO) and estrogen/methyl te. The patient previously had the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) on 21Dec2020. The patient stated, &#34;I woke from sleep about 12 hours later (10Jan2021) with rigors, muscle aches, head ache and pain in my inner ears as well as photophobia and feeling of exhaustion. The rigors had resolved by 8am but other symptoms persisted. I was too weak to walk further than the bathroom. I was able to consume only warm liquids, although I had no nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Note that since onset post infectious irritable bowel symptoms in February after visiting a city, weeks before the pandemic was recognized, I have had very abnormal but not absent sense of taste and smell, making me wonder whether I was infected in February without the usual symptoms.&#34; The patient recovered from rigors on 10Jan2021, outcome of the event weakness was unknown while other events were not recovered.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

When she woke up at 8:30 AM her headache was very severe and was accompanied with very severe chest pain. She immediately took her to the ER. They did a very thorough work up to check on her heart and Aorta. They managed her severe pain with two doses of morphine followed by two days of Dilaudid. The imaging and symptoms left her with a newly discovered diagnosis of Pericarditis. The medical professions were sure this was a result of the COVID vaccine. They continued to treat her for a few days and sent her home with anti inflammatories to help. She continues to have muscle pain, weakness and shortness of breath when she walks. She is scheduled to take her 2nd dose on February 5th but we are very concerned and hesitant as we don&#39;t want to cause any more damage to her heart.

Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included imaging: pericarditis on 16Jan2021 and Nasal Swab: negative on 16Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events which included Colchicine and prednisone, morphine and dilaudid. The outcome of the events was recovering. The events &#34;headache&#34;, &#34;chest pain&#34;, &#34;pericarditis&#34;and &#34;severe pain&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and disability.

                                                Patient presented on 1/24 with acute onset weakness and numbness of the left leg so a stroke alert was activated. NIHSS 3. Head Ct and CTA head/neck were unremarkable. Not a candidate for tPA given on Eliquis. Initial exam was notable for weakness and sensory loss in the left leg, but a sensory level was also found to the umbilicus raising concern for a myelitis. Of note, the patient also reported that certain red colored things she looked at appeared black. Labs unrevealing- CBC, CMP unremarkable. ESR, CRP normal. UA and UCx positive for E. Coli UTI, she was treated with ceftriaxone. MRIs were done of her brain, cervical and thoracic spine which were unrevealing. On 1/25, her exam worsened including worsening weakness in the left leg and new numbness and paresthesias in the right leg. Reflexes were preserved. MRI L spine was done which was unrevealing. Lumbar puncture was done which showed 2 nucleated cells and mildly elevated protein at 50, but was otherwise unrevealing. IgG Index normal. No oligoclonal bands. She developed mild hyperreflexia in the left leg and continued to have a sensory level, now at around T5-6. Repeat imaging of her cervical and thoracic spine were completed on 1/28 which showed a contrast enhancing hyperintensity at T5. The patient was diagnosed with myelitis and she was started on IV methylprednisolone x5 days and sent to rehab. Patient is now significantly improved though continues to report some numbness in the left leg.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date (lot EL8982) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the right arm. The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.

                                                Was skiing on mountain - became extremely tired, muscles in legs hurting badly, back pain for 5 days before increased, Could hardly move, shortness of breath , had to stop constantly to get down the slopes to condo,  very weak, laid down on bed, had chills and sweats off and on, felt achy all over - could hardly move around - in other words had symptoms of Covid 19 slept overnight. The next morning was much better although still a bit tired.  It was very scary but I realized that it was a reaction to the vaccination.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 at 10:40 (at the age of 75-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included arthritis from an unknown date, renal cancer since 07Dec2020 and ongoing, atrial fibrillation since 2006 and ongoing,  partial nephrectomy on 06 Jan2021. She specified that she has an arthritis flare up about once a year and normally takes a Medrol dose pack.  The patient&#39;s historical vaccines included an unspecified flu vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) on an unspecified date about ten years ago after which she had to go to the Emergency Room for right arm redness, swelling at the injection site and face swelling on right side. She did not get another flu shot for 10 years but did get one this year in Nov2020. Concomitant medication included metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), flecainide acetate (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN, MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reports that she experienced a light headache. She clarified that she is in an unspecified program which includes an e-diary. As part of that program (app) she was sent a text every day for a week asking if she had any side effects; a couple times she had a headache.  On the eighth day (03Feb2021) she had a reaction where her right hand and wrist was painful and swollen. Caller states she couldn&#39;t move her hand without pain. Caller states she put ice on her hand Wednesday evening and this helped a little.  When ice was on her hand it helped with the pain but when it was removed it came back. She also reported fingers on right were all swollen and that she does have arthritis.  She further described the events as on Wednesday she started getting a little pain in her right wrist joint. She does have arthritis, but this pain was stronger, and her hand and fingers on right were all swollen in comparison to her other hand, and her knuckles seemed bigger. States that the pain got very strong and by the next morning she could barely move her arm; even though it was only her wrist that hurt, moving any part of her arm made her wrist her more, so she started icing it and took Tylenol for Arthritis 650mg Extended Release; she took it twice, one each time and reported that it probably didn&#39;t work. Caller clarifies statement about it probably not working; stating that she didn&#39;t notice a difference after taking the Tylenol.  She asked if these events, occurring eight days after the vaccine could be vaccine side effects or is this just a flare up on her arthritis that is unrelated to the vaccine. She added that she had been doing a lot of &#34;chopping&#34; while cooking on the night that this happened so that may have caused the flare up. She has a Medrol pack on hand for things like this (4mg tablets). She started it today and took two tablets before breakfast and one tablet at lunch. She states that it has already made a difference in her pain. She stated her concern, however, which is that she found that taking a steroid could affect the vaccine if taken before getting the vaccine, and right now she is in-between the two doses.  Her second dose is scheduled for 16Feb2021. She inquired as to if she can finish this dose pack without messing up the vaccine. The clinical outcome of headache was reported as recovered. The clinical outcomes of  hand swelling, wrist pain, hand pain and swelling of wrists were reported as not recovered. The clinical outcomes of arthritis flare up, swelling of fingers and could not move her arm were unknown.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 75-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 (age at the time of vaccination was 75-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure, osteoporosis and overactive bladder. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The previously had first dose (first shot) of BNT162B2 for covid-19 immunisation and had sore arm. It was reported that she is getting red bumps today (on 07Feb2021) on the part where she got injected. The consumer stated after second shot also, I had no symptoms except for sore arm on an unspecified date in Feb2021. The only thing that I noticed which was from second shot and which was really crazy is, once in a while I get this pain in my pointer finger in my right hand and that was it, it comes and it goes. But today, and in the last couple of days I noticed a little weakness in my right leg, but today when I went to work somebody said what is that big red bump on your forehead and I looked and there was a big red circle, there was a bump, like a real bump on my forehead. I didn&#39;t hide it, I didn&#39;t even think if it was allergic as I only had a banana before I went to work and a cup of coffee which I have lot of time. I am wondering if this bump that I have on my forehead which looks ridiculous and it is a big red bump, like a tumor bump, it feels like kind of sore when I touch it, is from the vaccine because I haven&#39;t had anything but the vaccine.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Main thing I am concerned about is the big red bump on my forehead.&#34; Treatment: Consumer stated, &#34;I never had that before, it is very slight. The main thing was the bump on my head that came today and I didn&#39;t have it when I left the house. I didn&#39;t hit my head or anything. I just took two Tylenol and an allergy pill in case if it was some kind of allergy.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 75-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6207) at the age of 75-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetic type 2 for probably 13-14 years, sleep apnea for 20 years (2001), arthritis in 2005 (probably 12-14 years), and blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure). Concomitant medications included metformin, sertraline, alprazolam, sitagliptin (JANUVIA), oxybutynin, insulin glargine (LANTUS), lisinopril for blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure), and cortisone for arthritis. The patient received the vaccine on 13Mar2021 in the afternoon and within 24 to 30 hours, the next day (14Mar2021), her right arm, where the vaccine was administered turned all red and swollen and her elbow also hurt. She went to the emergency room because she felt it was a reaction to the vaccine. They told her that it was a bacterial skin infection, an adverse effect of an initial encounter to the vaccine, arm swelling and bursitis caused by that, muscle pain and join pain in elbow and then she guessed it was like cellulitis. They gave her ROCEPHIN at the emergency room and then a couple days later, it wasn&#39;t getting any better and it was all the way down to her wrist. She went to immediate care center and received an antibiotic. She was also given 2 more prescription of antibiotics and told that it had to be administered with the antibiotics to get rid of the reactions. It has finally pretty much cleared up with the antibiotics if they hadn&#39;t put her in an immediate care and put her on intravenous medications. They were really concerned because it was going to get into sepsis or something. At first, the patient thought that it was just inflamed, then it was skin infection and then adverse effect from the initial encounter of the vaccine. She had been on the antibiotics for 10 days when it finally cleared, but the elbow was still sore and it hurts a lot, but the fluid was drained by an orthopedic doctor. She was given 2 different types of antibiotics plus a shot into her buttocks. It&#39;s a little sore because she was informed that &#34;the bruise have been flamed&#34; on Mar2021. When she went to emergency, first they give her 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched antibiotic to DURICEF and to BACTRIM DS, and advised to continue monitoring and if swelling and redness was progressive or worse, then go to emergency room again. She went to emergency room on 16Mar2021, the medicine given was doxycycline and then she was seen by an orthopedic physician today where the fluid was drained from her elbow but swelling and redness was progressively getting worst and she was feeling hot on Mar2021. So, she went to the immediate care. Overall, consistent to cellulitis of right upper arm strongly includes to go to the ER but the patient had something else and had to go right then. And then, she was given 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched to DURACEF and BACTRIM. She came back to the ER on the same day. It was kind of 2 things, like the redness and skin infection which currently was cellulitis. Doxycycline was what they told her to get, that&#39;s what they gave her at the emergency room, doxycycline hyclate. And then said to follow-up with her primary care which she did and that was on 17Mar2021. She looked at it and then they told her to see an orthopedic surgeon and she saw him on the 18Mar2021. They just thought that the antibiotics, that&#39;s why he gave her 2 different prescriptions plus the shot in the buttocks because he said if this will not be cured with the antibiotics, she&#39;ll end up in a hospital. And then it was raft and it took her 10 days to recover. And he marked little black dots to show where wasn&#39;t and if it goes beyond that then call us because it was spreading. The outcome of the events bruise and feeling hot was unknown, not recovered for joint pain, and recovered on 24Mar2021 for all other events. The events required emergency room visit/ physician office visit.

A 75-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY), dose 2 via unknown route of administration on 03Apr2021 (Lot Number: ER8729, Expiry date: Jul 2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was breast cancer. The patient historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on (LOT:EJ1686 Expiration: 31MAR2021) on 13 Mar 2021  for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no family history. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced chills on 04Apr2021, sore left arm on 13Apr2021, Rash on the left side of her face; itchy; face felt like it was hot on Apr2021, chills on her left side from her foot to her neck: on 17Apr2021, Tiredness on an unknown date and tightness in her left leg that felt like a tunicate was left on 17Apr2021, wasn&#39;t feeling herself Apr2021. The patient stated she wanted to send pictures of her rash on her face that her dermatologist diagnosed last Tuesday as a Covid Vaccine side effect. She had the first dose of the vaccine on 13Mar2021 and the second dose on 03Apr2021. They were both done at (withheld). With the first, she had no side effects, other than a sore left arm. The second she had a sore arm and a couple of chills at first. Then two weeks post second vaccination she wasn&#39;t feeling herself, and she went to see a primary about that, but that wasn&#39;t a definite that it was side effects from the vaccine. Then, the following week on a Thursday she got a rash about the same time but it was getting itchy so she decided someone should look at it. At first she thought it was from her mask, but it was only on the left side of her face. Caller states she wrote a message to her doctor about not feeling well but she didn&#39;t connect all of the other symptoms. She went to her primary for the chills on her left side from her foot to her neck and just not feeling like herself. She had a tightness in her left leg that felt like a tunicate was left on. Her face felt like it was hot. States it was really very weird and she was very tired. The tiredness comes and goes. States she was doing interviews yesterday for a long time, virtual interviews and by 12 noon she felt so tired and took a nap and felt out of sorts. She Didn&#39;t show her the rash because she thought it was just from her mask and she wasn&#39;t a dermatologist. Didn&#39;t mention it to her primary. States she tried to cancel the appointment but said she needed to come see her anyway. Thursday she had another appointment so she called the dermatologist when it started to itch and she said to the office, should she be worried. At first, said no time, and reported to doctor and fit her in at 13:30 and she looked at it and said it is really impressive for being 2 weeks old and thinks it is Covid vaccine related. Didn&#39;t know if she should report it or not. Maybe it is something. Was thinking the Covid rash was extensive. She still has the tiredness. It reminds her of the tiredness she had after radiation for breast cancer. States it wasn&#39;t during the radiation, but 4-5 weeks later and lasted about a month. States the tiredness is not from a lack of sleep, it is like a veil comes over her. States if she has taken 10 naps in her whole life, that is a lot for her and that didn&#39;t help. Treatment: Gel for the Rash; states for her leg issue the doctor ordered an MRI to rule out a back or disc problem. States she didn&#39;t put it together, one said it might be and another side not sure. At first she was offered the Moderna and she changed when they offered the Pfizer, because of the breast issues from the Moderna. Curious to see at some point if point if other people are experiencing rashes on their faces. Caller states she didn&#39;t know what type of rash was common, she assumed it was more of a bodily rash. Tetanus back in the Fall or maybe July thinks last July, she had GI stuff and her physician wasn&#39;t particularly believing it was from that. The event tiredness wsa assessed as serious (Medically significant), and tightness in her left leg that felt like a tunicate was left considered serious (Disability). The all other events were assessed as non-serious. The patient had physicians room visit (PCP and dermatologist) and not had emergency room visit. The causality assessment was unknown for all events. The outcome of the event rash on the left side of her face; itchy; face felt like it was hot and tiredness was not recovered, The outcome of all other events was recovered.  Additional information requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering a plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be completely excluded.
