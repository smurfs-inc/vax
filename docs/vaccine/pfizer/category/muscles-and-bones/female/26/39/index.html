                                                On 01/07/2021 I woke up  at 0300am with chills, headache, body aches, joint pain, fever of 101.2 and swollen left axillary lymph nodes. I took Tylenol and Benadryl and it relieved the fever/headache/body aches/joint pain, however the lymph nodes in my left axillary remained swollen. I continue to take Tylenol for the fever/body aches/pains without relief for the swollen and painful axillary lymph nodes. Warm  compresses do help to relieve the pain temporarily but they remain painfully swollen. On 01/08/21 I called my doctors office to ask if it was normal to experience such painfully swollen axillary lymph nodes to which they stated ?we don?t know, it is too soon for us to tell what?s normal and what isn?t normal right now.? They did not offer any suggestions to relieve the pain or swelling. The morning of 01/09/2021 , I called Employee Health at my hospital (my place of work and also where I received the vaccine) and they also stated they didn?t know if this was a normal reaction due to the newness of the vaccine. A couple hours later, employee health emailed me a link to the VAERS reporting website and asked me to file a report.

                                                12 hours after administration, woken up from sleep by tingling, throbbing in lower legs. Described as a nerve and muscle ache/throb, or &#34;growing pains&#34;/RLS symptoms. Put on compression socks which helped, but still too uncomfortable to sleep. Was able to sleep after taking ibuprofen 800mg and drinking water. 6 hours after the ibuprofen was administered, pain returned in lower legs as well as neck/ears  with body temperature swings (cold, teeth chattering to sweating uncontrollably in a few minutes). After 1 hour of trying to sleep but failing, put compression socks back on. Temperature rose to 100-100.2 F, chills causing whole body to shake under multiple blankets. Tingling/muscle pains extremely uncomfortable and unable to rest, took another ibuprofen 800mg and water and was able to sleep. Tingling and muscle pains have continued as soon as ibuprofen wears off and come back more intense each time, most notably in the lower legs and near ears/neck and elbow of arm administered in (similar to &#34;tennis elbow,&#34; assumed to be provoked by inflammation, happened with first dose).

                                                At 1 AM on 1/19/21, I awoke with chills, a fever of 101, neck pain, muscle pain, joint pain, and a severe headache. This persisted throughout the night and I did not sleep. Took 1000 mg of Acetaminophen at 5:30 and slept until 7 AM. By 8 AM, my temperature was back down to 98 F. Took 500 mg of Acetaminophen at 10 AM with food. Headache, muscle pain, and joint pain persisted. Moderate to severe chest pain began 15 mins after eating at 4 PM. Waited 30 mins to see if it resolved; it did not. Went to the urgent care. Chest x-ray and EKG was performed, no issues found. Was diagnosed with costochondritis and was given a steroid shot and ibuprofen,  which reduced the pain significantly within 30 mins later.

The patient also experienced significant body aches, especially pronounced in lower back region occurred. Headache also present at this time (09Jan2021). She began having sweats and possible fever (didn&#39;t have thermometer to accurately verify this though). The patient&#39;s average HR is usually 70s. For about 36 hours (09Jan2021), it ran 100-130s. Vomiting episodes continued and for all of 09Jan2021, the patient did absolutely nothing. The patient described her body ached like it had been beaten by a baseball bat. On 10Jan2021, her HR at rest back in 70s, but with minimal exertion, will go to 110-120s. She had to call out of work from 11Jan2021 and 12Jan2021 due to continued nausea, dehydration and excessive fatigue. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient&#39;s symptoms still persisting at the time she is reporting this event. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the event &#34;having sweats&#34; was unknown, while the patient is recovering for the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported serious chill was likely related to the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular in left deltoid on 20Jan2021 11:00 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunisation. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first dose yesterday at 11:00am. She was talking to someone and all of a sudden she got throat to neck pain that was intense that lasted two minutes on 21Jan2021. It has been about 10-15minutes since and if she hold her neck straight she is fine, but if she looks up it hurts. She can breathe fine. It hurts to swallow all of a sudden on 21Jan2021.

States she is a nurse and she is tired. Her head feels fuzzy, she has not taken her temperature recently and it still hurts to swallow. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Relatedness of drug to events from reporter for throat and neck pain, hurts to swallow, low grade fever, headache, body aches was reported as related. Reporter seriousness for throat and neck pain and hurts to swallow was medically significant. Event outcome of throat and neck pain was recovered, of hurts to swallow was not recovered, of others was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were likely causally related to the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  However, it is worth noting that the reporter/user of the vaccine was nurse, and her tiredness from job could have confounded with the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

Patient evaluate 2 L of fluid given her Mirena IUD D-dimer was sent which was negative patient with no pleuritic symptoms or dyspnea to suggest pulmonary embolism. Otherwise hemodynamically stable on exam ambulates with no difficulty no focal neurologic deficits. Patient did describe on her initial presentation that she noted some weakness of her bilateral legs. Given her possible viral reaction and description of weakness it is possible the patient is developing an early autoimmune reaction however she has no evidence of GuillainBarré or transverse myelitis on my exam. We will plan to discharge with neurology follow-up as outpatient.

Two days later I had an area of papules on my anterior thigh the size of a half dollar. The right sided back pain then began to radiate around to my hip and the rash began to be painful. My right thigh eventually began to tingle and and the pain increased in severity. On Jan 7th I presented to the acute care clinic at the Clinic and was diagnosed with shingles.

Pain is experienced when I attempt to cross my left arm over my body. Lump and pain still remains 51 hours after vaccination.

                                                Got 1st shot at 1430 1/4/21. Was sent back to my unit (OR). At 1455 got full body flush followed by tingling lips, tight throat, trouble swallowing and SOB. No obvious signs of swelling of the lips. Used inhaler for SOB which helped marginally. After 1.5 hrs tingling in lips and flushed skin went away. Throat tightness and SOB still remained but weren&#39;t progressing so went home after my shift. Later that night around 2100 took 1 25mg  Benadryl. Tightness in throat and SOB improved. The next morning 1/5/21, I reported to work for my shift. Tightness and SOB was manageable at this point. At 0800 the tightness in my throat, trouble swallowing and SOB got significantly worse. I was scrubbed into a surgery and had to call for a replacement so I could take Benadryl. I took 1 25mg tablet and 2 puffs of my inhaler and went back to my case. After the Benadryl and inhaler, the tightness in my throat and SOB became slightly more manageable. At 1240 the symptoms came back and I took another Benadryl and 2 puffs of my inhaler with slight relief of symptoms. Stayed the rest of my shift continuing my inhaler as needed and a Benadryl every 4 hrs. At 1600 I developed a headache at the front of my head above my eyes like a weight was sitting there. The next day when I woke up 1/6/21, the tightness in my throat, SOB and headache were worse so I had to call into work. The headache that morning had progressed to 7 out of 10 pain and the pain then included my neck where it attaches to the skull. At 0830 I called employee health and they advised my to go to an urgent care. I was checked over by a PA and was prescribed prednisone 40 mg for 5 days along with Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler as needed. I was also nasal swabbed for Covid. After taking the steroid, the headache and neck pain, tightness in throat went away. The SOB also improved. Currently taking the steroid, Benadryl (every 4 hrs) and inhaler 2 puffs as needed. Symptoms are mostly controlled. 1/7/21 tried to cut back the Benadryl to every 6 hrs. Noticed a huge difference in my breathing and had an increase in SOB so went back to every 4 hrs. 1/8/21 still taking steroid and Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler. SOB is worse today even with taking Benadryl. Have an appointment with my PCP to talk about getting the 2nd shot.

Not able to do normal activities. Took Tylenol and ice pack to alleviate fever. The day after injection, body fell so weak that my body acquired another viral infection (very unusual). No shortness of breath. Eating/drinking/appetite fine. No loss of taste/smell.  I am exactly 1 week from the injection. No fever, just light headache. Able to resume normal activities but gets fatigued fairly quickly (after 3 hours). I am very active and work out 2 hours every day, but may not be able to do strenuous activity/exercise for some time...  I was symptomatic covid last year in April 2019. This was very similar experience but an extremely debilitating, more intense version of the covid that I had.  ***I am unsure if I should proceed with the second dose due to a very severe reaction to the first dose***

I felt really dizzy and nauseated, I felt like I could not walk. I felt like I hit by a bus. The next day I had heavy flu symptoms, high fever, continuous chest pain and high HR, at the ER they gave me a high dose of Benadryl, steroids and fluids. I took Benadryl for about 7 days and I still felt light headed palpitations and fever for almost 2 weeks. I also was tested for COVID and it was negative. I was advised to not take the second vaccine. I still have a really bad fatigue. It is the symptom that is still on and off.

                                                Neuropraxia of Left Arm; A PHASE 1/2/3, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED, OBSERVER-BLIND, DOSE-FINDING STUDY TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, IMMUNOGENICITY, AND EFFICACY OF SARS-COV-2 RNA VACCINE CANDIDATES AGAINST COVID-19 IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS  This is a report from an interventional study source for Protocol C4591001 sponsored by BioNTech, managed and reported by Pfizer on the sponsor&#39;s behalf. The subject is in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred.  A 27-year-old female with a medical history of seasonal allergies (Mar2006 and ongoing not taking any medications to treat) who received the first dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 1) on 14Aug2020 at 10:34, second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 2) on 04Sep2020 at 09:27. The first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) on 23Dec2020 at 09:25, and the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) on 11Jan2021 at 09:48. All intramuscularly in the left deltoid as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Concomitant medications included ethinyl-estradiol/norethisterone acetate (LOESTRIN) for birth control from May2014 and ongoing. There was no family medical history relevant to AE and no concomitant vaccine administered on the same date of investigational vaccine or other prior vaccine within four weeks.  The subject experienced neuropraxia of left arm on 11Jan2021 at 09:51 considered an important medical event requiring a visit to physician office.  The clinical course was the following: At 9:51, 3 minutes after receiving the second dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid, the subject complained of left arm numbness and tingling starting at elbow and extending to fingers, weakness, and a weak grip in that hand. She also reported a decreased range of motion on the left side including her arm, shoulder joint, elbow, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal. Subject was afebrile with a normal vascular exam, no bruising, capillary refill time was less than 3 seconds. No antipyretic medication was administered. The investigator requested the subject to return to site the following day. On 12Jan2021, the investigator noted some improvement to symptoms but the subject was unable to return to work for several days after event. An appointment was scheduled with a neurologist for 13Jan2021. The action taken with BNT162B2 for the event was not applicable. The clinical outcome of the event was recovering.   The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event neuropraxia of left arm was related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) and clinical trial procedure (vaccination administration in the left deltoid, investigator did consider the location was appropriate), but unrelated to first and second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO), first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) or concomitant medications. Per investigator, it was not likely that the event was related to the investigational product (IP) itself, however, that could not be 100% determined until neurologist had evaluated the subject.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  There is a reasonable possibility for the event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; to be related to the procedure of vaccine (BNT162B2) administration (needle trauma) rather than to the product administered. The event would not be considered a unique response to this specific vaccine (BNT162B2). The case will be reassessed upon reception of neurological advice.  Pfizer&#39;s safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 31-DEC-2020 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Nerve injury. Review of the database for the PT Nerve injury had the following results: 0 serious clinical trial cases and 1 non-clinical trial case.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committee and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 27-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 27-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Bell&#39;s Palsy (motor nerves involved) from 2017 to 2017. Concomitant medications included unspecified birth control. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced Bell&#39;s Palsy, severe muscle pain, itching in the left arm, rash in the left arm, cold sensation, like it was freezing, and severe allergic reaction on an unspecified date. It was reported that the Bell&#39;s Palsy lasted 8 days and was considered a modified Bell&#39;s Palsy because it only sensorial nerves were involved. It was reported that the patient did not receive any treatment for Bell&#39;s Palsy. The clinical outcome of Bell&#39;s Palsy, severe muscle pain, itching in the left arm, rash in the left arm, cold sensation, like it was freezing, and severe allergic reaction was recovered on an unspecified date.

At 1815 I developed blurred vision. The dizziness and blurred vision prevented me from standing. I was able to walk with assistance at 1915. The blurred vision lasted until 1915. The dizziness lasted until 2230.  At 2000 I had muscle aches and joint pain and could not get comfortable. Muscle aches and joint pain lasted until 1-1-21 at 1930. I did not seek medical treatment. (I working in the ER and did not feel it was severe enough to check in because the shortness of breath was mild and went away shortly after the dizziness began at 1815). I took Benadryl 50 mg at 1930 and 1000mg of Tylenol.

                                                had a 102 degree fever for about 15 hours which started the evening of 1/5/21, which also included chills and muscle aches. The muscle aches lasted about 24 hours. The injection site was my left arm and I now have swelling in my left axilla which started the evening of 1/6/21 and is still currently swollen. I am an ultrasound technologist and was able to scan myself this morning when I came back to work. It appears I have a cluster of reactive lymph nodes in the area of swelling within my left axilla, the largest measuring 3.0 cm. It is very tender in the area of swelling and the pain radiates down my left arm. I had a lot of pain at the injection site that lasted for about 24 hours, it is now subsiding. However, for the last 24 hours it has been very painful to bend my arm. Any time I tried to bend my arm it sent a throbbing pain down to my left hand, it is still occurring today.

A 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EJ1685), intramuscularly in the left arm on 17Dec2020 at 11:00 (at the age of 28-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included famotidine and fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA), both for unknown indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously took and had an allergy to amoxicillin. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 23Dec2020 at 13:00, the patient developed pain in her left axilla (6 days after vaccination). The patient was able to palpate a swollen lymph node in her left axilla. It continued to become more painful requiring ibuprofen and hot compresses. By 31Dec2020, her symptoms had largely resolved. She saw her physician who also felt the lymphadenopathy and had no other explanation than possible vaccine side effect. The clinical outcome of pain in her left axilla, swollen lymph node in her left axilla/lymphadenopathy, able to palpate a swollen lymph node in her left axilla was recovered on 31Dec2020. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Called off work from my job as a flight nurse at midnight. Tried to sleep it off until about 0430 when the body aches became unbearable. Ate a few bites of yogurt and took 400mg of ibuprofen. No change in symptoms until 0530 when I took a hot shower which helped relieve some muscle pain. Took 400mg ibuprofen again at 1030 with a small snack with no change in pain or fevers. Took hot shower again which helped briefly. Nausea subsided around 1630, enough that I had a small meal of bland food and another 400mg of ibuprofen. By 1700 more tolerable myalgias and fever came down some. 2230 another 400mg dose of ibuprofen, fitful night of sleep waking again at 4am with shooting lower back pain and fever. Took another dose of 400mg ibuprofen and a hot shower. Woke up at 1000am sweaty with mild myalgias and low grade fever. Took another dose of ibuprofen 400mg, 30 minutes later profusely sweaty but afebrile. Fatigued all day and poor appetite until late evening. Woke up next day after better night of sleep at 0730. Mild fatigue and bad heartburn all day and night. Left arm still sore to touch. This morning (1/11) feeling mild heartburn but better.

                                                I was awoken from sleep with violent chills and an sensation of severe cold. My chills became violent and coarse rigors, severe enough to contract the spine into hyperextension if I kept my body in a neutral position. I could still activate each muscle group to keep in a fetal prostration pose. I was knowledgeable of the event, did not loose any bowel, bladder, or smooth muscle function, and the intensity of the rigors was focused on the most developed skeletal muscles (thighs, calves, upper arms, forearms, paraspinal muscles, hands, respectively).  Jaw and muscles of the head/face seemed unaffected. Fingers and toes not distinctly affected. I was not sweating at this time and there were NO other symptoms to report; I remained lucid and able to self-reflect the entire time. Home temperature is kept to consistent 66F, no malfunctions to thermostat. No recent changes to bedding (sheet and quit on top of mattress); it is even optimized for me as I tend to overheat as I sleep.   At 50 minutes, I felt &#34;less frozen&#34; and confident enough to stand/ambulate for 220mg naproxen &#43; 500mg APAP , cautiously and successfully swallowed. Robe was donned over existing pajamas and thick comforter was pulled from hallway closet. Rigors continued, but it appeared that intentional activation of the muscle groups could still overpower the rigors for safe (but shaky) ambulation. Greatest risk was coarsely shaking hands a bringing cup to mouth to swallow pills.   Above activity was completed in 5 minutes. I then sat upright in bed under layers above. I could feel the muscles calm and relax, with episode completely ending in 5 minutes. Total time of event: 60 minutes.   Post-event details: There was a mild sensation of muscle tension in the posterior cervical spine akin to whiplash, but no residual symptoms. I debriefed with my husband shortly thereafter (he has been in another room the whole time) and fell asleep by 23:30. Awoke to alarm at 05:00 and able to stretch, accomplish 30 min run, vacuum/mop the floors, and present to work by 08:00am without deficit.  Time of documentation: 11:22 am 1/15/2021

That night I woke up with moderate body aches and chills and a dull headache, no fever. The next morning, I awoke feeling very fatigued, severe muscle/body aches, headache and chills, still no fever. I slept most of the day. Extra strength Tylenol helped tremendously with the body aches. I was symptom free the morning of 1/15/2021. I was scheduled to work the day after my vaccination and was unable to due to the symptoms described.  I had no adverse reactions with my first dose.  I am a nursing mother and for the first and second doses, I noticed no side effects or any concerns with my child or milk supply.

This 28-year-old female nurse (patient) reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3246) at single dose at left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation on 11Jan2021 at 4:30 pm. Relevant history included contraception. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was none. Concomitant drug included ongoing ethinylestradiol, etonogestrel (NUVARING) for contraception for years. The patient experienced a headache, back ache, nausea and was almost passing out. She had the first dose of the vaccine on the 11Jan2021 at 4:30 PM and was in bed around 10:00 that night.  She woke up at 5:00 AM on 12Jan2021 and didn&#39;t feel great, her arm was killing her more than a normal vaccine and she was nauseated at 5:30, which was not that horrible. She took some Tylenol. Then she got to work and around 9:00 she felt like she was going to get sick. She had horrendous nausea, chills, weakness, eye pain, headache/ head pain, and back pain. Her clothes hurt because the body aches were so bad. She felt like she was going to pass out, like a vasovagal. She went to urgent care because her manager didn&#39;t think it was side effect. She went and got swabbed (result unknown), whatever. She had a fever then. They told her it was a reaction to the vaccine. Her temperature was 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit when she went to Urgent care. She would say the fever started at 12:30PM on 12Jan2021. She did not know if fever would be ongoing because she was taking fever reducer and it was working. The events weakness, eye pain, head pain, and back pain were reported as serious since medically significant. The nausea was better around 2:00PM. The outcome of event nausea, Chills was and Weakness was resolved on 12Jan2021.  The outcome of events eye pain, head pain, and back pain was resolving. The outcome of event &#39;her arm was killing her more than a normal vaccine&#39; was recovering. The outcome of fever was unknown. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was none.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events, weakness, eye pain, head pain, and back pain, and the administration the suspect vaccine, BNT162B2.

Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

Could feel left foot start to go numb and tingling and feel very cold. Took thin sock off foot, pinky toe was purple. Took pictures. Could not get foot to warm up with warm/hot compresses. Started having slight discomfort in lower back/butt with pain going down leg to toe within the hour. I believe this could be coincidence and have sciatic pain, but thought I should report just in case there are few other reported cases on this.   Purple discoloration was gone when woke in morning on 2/23/2021 It is now 2/24/2021 and I am still having sciatic pain and numb pinky toe.

                                                Next morning, I woke up with severe positional headache (headache with standing or sitting up, resolved completely with ibuprofen and tylenol within 20 minutes). The next morning I also had a sore left deltoid, and soreness extending into my left chest and shoulder, which diminished throughout the day after ibuprofen and tylenol. I also had a left swollen armpit, which I interpreted as swollen lymph nodes. My left armpit was sore and was visibly swollen compared to the right. The left lymph node is still visibly swollen as I report this (approximatley 36 hours after vaccine administration), and is sore but less sore than initially.   Of note, when I received the first vaccine in this series, my left deltoid was more sore than with the second administration, but soreness was limited to the deltoid and resolved within 3 days.

                                                Intense pain upon injection not felt with any other form of vaccine. Pain in arm continued to get worse throughout the day. Unable to lift my arm very far without pain. Worse than any other injection recieved in the past. Pain throught the night-causing lack of sleep. Severe pain for about 24 hours or so then completely gone. My muscle in my arm then felt tight as if there was inflammation of some sort or an injury to the muscle. Upon lifting my arm it felt as if my arm was pulling back. No pain during this action but more of a weakness. No relief from anti inflammatory medicaiton or ice. Sensation in arm noted to be gone on 01/09/2021.

A 29-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (expiry date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 05Jan2021 at single dose to get vaccinated to prevent COVID. Medical history was none. Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS) and hadn&#39;t taken Vitamins yesterday or day before. The patient got yesterday on 05Jan2021 the vaccine and thought that it was a side effect which she didn&#39;t have with the first vaccine. She had been having chills since last night 05Jan2021 and little bit of fever in Jan2021. She didn&#39;t have too much pain in her left arm right where she got the vaccine but her left clavicle that was swollen and painful to touch in Jan2021. The patient felt like she had a little bit of shortness and breathlessness last night 05Jan2021 but she was fine, her throat was super dry in Jan2021. For lot number, she stated &#34;It is E. I am not sure what the next one is. It might be like a 21284.&#34; The patient had taken only pain killers she took two pain killers before she went to bed she took two pain killers when she woke in the middle of night and in morning. For Lab work, she just started feeling like between 12. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Arm soreness was quite severe on 1/8, as it was painful to even lift the left arm for much of the day.  I also noted, about 5 hours after vaccination, that my jaw felt slightly tense, bilaterally.  On Friday, 1/8, I also experienced headache for the entire day, and I was fatigued for much of the day.   I noted clavicular lymph nodes as well.  About 18-20 hours after vaccination, I developed soreness in my back, and about 24 hours after vaccination, I noted some myalgia in the left leg.  These symptoms were responsive to acetaminophen.  The headache, clavicular lymph nodes, arm soreness, and myalgias were resolved by the time I woke up on 1/9.  Finally, I noted development of an axillary lymph node during the evening of 1/8, about 28 hours after vaccination.  This axillary node persisted until Monday, 1/11.

A 29-year-old female patient (pregnant: No) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot/Batch Number and Expiration Date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 12:00 PM (Left arm) at single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 09:00 PM (Arm Right) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The concomitant drug was reported as Escitalopram. The patient experienced pain in the injection site began within a few minutes (05Jan2021 12:15 PM) and gradually increased reaching it&#39;s maximum around 8 hours after the dose. Neck pain was also significant (05Jan2021 12:15 PM). Fatigue, malaise and mild headache started around 10 hours (05Jan2021 22:00) following vaccine administration. Almost 24 hours following administration (06Jan2021 12:00) a fever of 38 C started and persisted for about 6-8 hours. It subsided but severe fatigue and malaise (that prevent me to do daily activities) are still persisting greater than 48 hours following administration. The outcome of severe fatigue and malaise was not recovered. The outcome of Headache, Pain in the injection site, Neck pain, fever of 38 C, was recovering. No treatment received for the adverse event. No COVID prior vaccination and no COVID tested post vaccination.  Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                1 week history of significantly worsened (previously present &#34;low back strain&#34; lower back pain that had become radicular to both LE and associated with progressively worsening bilateral LE weakness, paresthesias since COVID vaccination last week. see continuation for HPI and assessment/plan from office note 1/13/21  HPI from OV dated 1/13/21  She had presented initially in December 2020 for her annual physical, and we evaluated some low back pain that that time, felt to be a sprain/strain resulting from a fall in the shower earlier December which was aggravated significantly by lifting/transferring a patient at the SNF she works for as a nurse. Presentation at that time was rather benign, no imaging obtained, pt was placed on leave from work for 1 week to avoid the heavy lifting and likely aggravation of back pain, and rx including diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine. She did not FU in the office, but returned to work at SNF a week after I saw her for the back pain. She states she had improved enough to feel like she could go back to work but wasn&#39;t 100% without back pain yet. At no time was comp mentioned at the visit in December. She did tell her employer about the injury and was off of work for a week and was encouraged to seek comp. We were never notified.    Yesterday 1/12 she followed up in the office for the back pain and was found to have much more severe pain, now radicular to both LE (pain intensity worse on right), with new neurologic impairment including objective weakness bilateral LE (R&gt;L), sensation disturbance bilateral LE (R&gt;L). Xray of lumbar spine obtained in clinic, this was essentially unremarkable, non-acute.  Pt was sent for stat MRI of the lumbar spine. MRI last night revealed no findings to explain her severe symptoms - she has mild symmetric disc bulging at L5-S1  nd mild bilateral facet arthropathy with patent canal and foramina, and a mild nonspecific  &#34;STIR signal abnormality&#34; within the soft tissues abutting the left lateral aspect of the L5 spinous processes felt to be small and nonspecific. I did discuss the case and the imaging with the radiologist and he feels this is unlikely to be the source of her back pain/radicular symptoms. No obvious signs of apparent discitis or any signficant soft tissue abnormality.    Pt contacted last night with initial &#34;normal&#34; results of MRI as formal results were pending - hydrocodone was sent to her pharmacy for pain relief overnight. Pt received 60mg toradol in the office yesterday during her visit. Pt noted significant improvement in her back pain, bilateral leg pain about 30 minuts after that injection. She continued to have pain in the evening but went to sleep. She woke at 3am unable to roll over due to weakness and pain - her sister gave her a hydrocodone and she went back to sleep&#39; she woke this morning feeling much better; today, she has less severe low back pain, less severe right lower leg radicular pain, NO pain radiating into the left LE, lessening of the weakness in her right LE, lessening of paresthesia reported in the right LE (now isolated just to the heel), resolution of the weakness in the left LE, resolution of the tingling of the left knee. Other than the toradol and one dose of hydrocodone, no other medications were given, no other treatments given since presentation yesterday.   Upon further questioning, patient does reveal that she received the 1st of 2 COVID-19 vaccinations (pfizer) last week. She received the vaccination at work at nursing home on 1/7/21. She had some relatively quick onset nausea and dizziness within an hour of the injection, but that resolved. She recalls feeling like her low back pain, bilateral lower leg pain, leg weakness and paresthesias all intensified sometime either Wednesday 1/6/21 or 1/7/21, but more obviously worsened over the weekend 1/9 and 1/10. Along with the lower extremity symptoms, she does admit today that she experienced soreness in bilateral upper arms starting the day following the vaccine administration, with left arm/shoulder still feeling sore and tender to the touch now. She also developed some altered sensation of the right thumb and index fingers the day following vaccination (1/8/21) and this has been persistent/unchanged. She is right handed. No prior issues with right hand/fingers. Other than the altered sensation, she denies pain, swelling, or notable weakness. She is right handed, and really hasn&#39;t done much with her right hand over the past week since she hasn&#39;t been working. Patient denies having significant headache, fever, chills, diaphoresis, fatigue, rashes/injection site erythema since the covid vaccination. She was not told to sign up for or told about the V-safe program and hadn&#39;t thought to report her symptoms to work or think to be concerned regarding possible vaccine SE. Pt denies prior hx of low back pain, neurologic symptoms including weakness/paresthesias, previous allergy to or adverse reaction to vaccination or injectable medications. She has a history of latent TB(fully treated) but is otherwise in good health.  After gathering much further detailed information/history today from patient, review of chart including the MRI results and xray results from yesterday, my prior OV note, and discussion with radiologist today regarding her MRI - I Discussed with patient and her sister that I believe what is becoming more apparent to me now is that she is likely suffering from an adverse event associated with the COVID-19 vaccination she received on 1/7/21 through her workplace. I&#39;m unable to define this for certain, but I suspect that she developed the progressive worsening of low back pain, development of radicular pain and bilateral LE weakness and paresthesias about 1-2 days following the vaccination administration. She has had notable and rather surprising improvement in both subjective and objective findings  Today as compared to yesterday. Only intervention was toradol 60mg IM and one dose of hydrocodone, she had already been taking diclofenac or ibuprofen so I believe the only explanation for the improvement over the past 24 hours is the fact that she is gradually having resolution of the temporary paraparesis, neuralgia, paresthesia brought on by the recent COVID-19 vaccination. I believe she truly had injury to the low back in December, initial injury at home but had improvmenet and then significant worsening/exacerbation when transferring a resident at work. Her presentation following that was consistent with a strain/sprain of the lumbar spine. This was treated appropriately with rest, activity modification, stretching, NSAID, and muscle relaxers. She returned to work w/o restriction likely earlier than she should have but I believe the covid vaccination is likely what caused her condition to so significantly decline; Its also possible that her physically demanding job requiring lifting/transferring/standing for prolonged periods of time on top of an only partially resolved low back strain had aggravated her low back condition.    plan from OV dated 1/13/21 Given the improvement since yesterday, I recommended obtaining some labs looking for any sign of alternative explanation including infectious etiology or autoimmune/inflammatory condition, however will hold on further imaging as would be the plan, specifically EMG of the bilateral LEs. Explained to patient that I&#39;m hopeful with continued rest and time, her symptoms (weakness, tingling/numbness, radicular back pain) will completely resolve. She may need some eventual PT for the disc bulge in the lumbar spine and lumbar strain that is likely still lingering. Will contact pt with any change in care plan based on the laboratory findings. I would like to closely follow her, and make sure her symptoms continue to slowly improve /resolve. If at any point she develops worsening symptoms again or any new neurologic signs/symptoms (and we discussed what emergency signs/symptoms would be) then she needs to be in touch with me right away. I will work on reporting this suspected adverse covid vaccine reaction to VAERS / possibly also CDC and see if they have any additional input/suggestions for monitoring/treatment.    For pain control, pt may continue with the diclofenac OR ibuprofen, and the hydrococone/APAP as needed for breakthrough severe pain uncontrolled with the NSAID. I have advised pt to remain off of work at this time, resting at home avoiding lots of physical activity as she continues to heal. Suspect will have her follow up in clinic sometime next week for repeat evaluation/examination depending on VAERS/CDC recommendations and of course the lab results and any updated condition reports from the patient in the interim. Will want to make sure she has full resolution of the paresis and adequate resolution of her back pain/radicular pain prior to returning to work, even in a limited capacity. I am informed today that there is light duty available and will keep that in mind. Pt to be contacted regarding follow up. Encouraged to call with questions/concerns/updates. Pt was very thankful for the care.

                                                I received my second dose of the vaccine at 03:00pm on 1/12/21. I noticed around 06:00pm that I started feeling a little tired and some pain around the injection site. I had anticipated this as I felt similar symptoms from the first dose of the vaccine. I took a nap and woke up around 09:00pm feeling some of the worst body aches I had felt in a long time. My arm that I received my vaccine in was painful and warm to the touch. I felt dehydrated as well so I drank a pedialyte, took OTC Tylenol extra strength, and laid down again. Around 07:00am on 1/13/21, I still felt achy, sweaty, and felt pain in the arm that I recieved the vaccine in. I went into my bathroom, and noticed two small red and raised areas around the injection site. I took pictures of the site, and continued to closely monitor through out the day. I ended up calling in sick to work on 1/13/21. It is now around 12:00pm on 1/14/21, and I woke up with a pounding headache, muscle aches, dehydration, nausea, and low energy. I feel like I am hungover or have the flu, and am planning on calling in sick to work again. I reported my symptoms to my staffing department at my workplace on 1/13/21 and wanted to file a report here as well.

                                                First Dose-  I had a headache after the shot and tremors started that even and throughout the night. No fevor. Arm very sore, going into neck.   Second Dose-  Felt find the night. Woke up that morning at 1am and with tremors and in a night sweat. Checked temp and it was only 96, but felt hot and was sweating. Woke up the next morning and my entire body, muscles and joints ached. My knuckles, ached, kept getting sharp pains in my knuckles. My jaw ached, difficulty eating. My entire body, my muscle ached, difficulty moving. I didn&#39;t get a headache till that evening. I also had severe heart burn that night, not sure if it was related, but I have never had heart burn that bad. The next morning when I woke up (5am) (now two days after my shot), again my joints hurts, I couldn&#39;t even stand.  Its like my knees couldn&#39;t even support me and I had a massive headache.  I went back to bed and woke around 9am, no longer had a headache, muscles still hurt. Around 11am, all of a sudden, muscles and joints felt fine.   The only thing (day three) is my arm pit on my left side where i got the shot is bothering my extremely bad.  I was able to put an ultrasound probe on my axilla area, and I have swollen lymph nodes in my axilla in the area that is very painful. I also have a dull pain in my elbow.

I was also extremely fatigued and found it difficult to get out of bed or off of the couch. I had a severe headache that lasted the majority of the day. Thursday&#39;s are typically my day off therefore I did not have to call out of work sick, however I most likely would have if I had been scheduled that day.

On Jan. 21st, 2021, I woke up feeling feverish.  I went to use the bathroom, and after washing my hands I walked towards the bathroom door and felt light-headed and dizzy.  Suddenly, I passed out and hit my head and upper neck on the tile floor.  My parents heard the sound of my fall and luckily rushed to the bathroom.  They found me lying  unconscious on the floor with my eyes rolled up for what felt like more than a minute.  I regained consciousness on my own, and I drank water with a bit of sugar and salt mixed in.    I felt too weak to get up and walk, and the back of my head and upper neck were in pain.  I told my parents to call 911 as I wanted to make sure that there was no serious damage to my brain or neck area.  I went to the local hospital in an ambulance.  I was taken to the emergency room: Vitals were done and my temperature ranged from then was 99.5-101F and my heart rate was high- it stayed around 112 bpm for some time I was given 2 L of IV Saline Fluids EKG result: no clinical abnormalities CT head/neck/spine: negative 2 different types of COVID-19 tests: results were both negative Bloodwork: CBC/BMP/D-dimer: no clinical abnormalities Chest Xray: negative 2D- doppler ultrasound: negative Holter monitor: negative for irregular heart rhythm I was discharged the same day around 4:30pm

Side effects began 2 days after her 2nd COVID vaccine. Pt was transferred to hospital from another institution due to O2 sat in the 60s (room air), leukocytosis, and AKI. Patient was treated empirically for sepsis/pneumonia as well as lupus flare. She was also initiated on high dose steroids. Possible reaction to vaccine. Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and no signs of pulmonary embolism. Pt was transferred from hospital to another facility given progressive organ failure, most specifically liver failure.

Not much longer and the hives/itching spread down my back and chest. Face became swollen. Benadryl cream was initially attempted, but only briefly subsided the itching and reaction continued spreading. I took oral quick release Benadryl and was able to prevent the reaction from continuing. I had to take a secondary Benadryl dose a few hours later and extreme joint pain accompanied the allergic reaction.

Approximately 7-8 days after my vaccination, my left armpit started feeling sore. This has continued to today where I have left armpit swelling and what feels to be a swollen, hardened lymph node in my armpit. It feels like a hardened lump that is not fixed and is tender when I palpate it. On visual inspection, I can tell that my left armpit is more swollen than my right armpit (which is normal). It hurts to have my arm at my side and it hurts to lay on my left side at night when I am sleeping.

Two days ago, I stated to developing swelling in my hands with achy joints which has not gone away.

                                                When vaccine was administered, seemed high on my arm.  I had immediate soreness and shoulder discomfort, I was told this was normal.  It continued to progress and I eventually had decreased ROM, weakness and sharp shooting pain in my shoulder.  Working at OI, I consulted provider, xrays were obtained and I was evaluated.  He strongly suggested an MRI be obtained as well.  That was completed the same day as my evaluation on 12/31/2020 (1 week and 2 days after the vaccine was administered).  The provider informed me that they have had patients with similar situations that were evaluated for frozen shoulder after having a vaccine d/t administration site and vaccine going into subacromial space.  He does report that this was my case/situation, upon my exam, I had severe inflammation with this as well-he is now having me follow up for a surgical consultation for my shoulder to be repaired.  Today&#39;s date is 1/7/2021, I have these same ongoing symptoms that have continued since day of administration, without diminishing in severity.  He is unable to provide an injection d/t my upcoming second dose of the COVID vaccine this next week, 1/12/2021.  He strongly suggests that my 2nd vaccine be administered elsewhere-advised NOT be administered in the same shoulder OR in opposite to cause these symptoms to flare.  He advised in gluteus if possible to avoid any further issues if at all possible.

                                                About 12 hours of receiving my second dose I started to get really bad chills. Nothing could keep me warm and I had a fever of 102.  I had muscle aches  as if I just went through a rigorous workout. I had zero appetite but I?m not sure if that was due to side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. When I did finally eat something that evening I could barely taste it, I ate it but my taste buds were faintly picking up the flavors. Again I don?t know if it was because of the side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. The following day, Saturday 01/09/21 I only had chills which would come and go. I did not have fever and my appetite was back. Now today, 01/10/21 I feel my usual self.

It shortly progressed to a cold/numb sensation from my deltoid down to my finger tips. This persisted but seemed to transition from more numbness to moderate pain from my left scapula, neck and down to my fingers about 7 hours after the vaccine. I also developed intermittent fasiculations of my forearm muscles on the left arm. This morning I woke up with worsening pain, mild numbness but new weakness in the hand and arm. I have a weak grip and can?t fully grab objects. My wrist flexión and extension are also weak as well as shoulder abduction (I am a neurologist by the way so can?t localize it to any nerve distribution). I?m not weak anywhere else and I only have mild arthralgia and diarrhea systemically.

Massive headache coinciding. My arm felt like I had tennis elbow and overall joint pain. Nausea and vomiting through the night. Went to bed about 9:30. Woke up with a fever of 99. Off and on fever and chills through Friday, 72 hours after initial injection. Finally resolved late Friday night.

A 30-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), lot number: Ek4176, via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at 08:30 (at the age of 30 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination.  Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, gastritis, and hiatal hernia all from an unknown date. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included spironolactone, ethinylestradiol, norgestimate (SPRINTEC), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL XR), and &#39;dexylan&#39;, all for unknown indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination, but did receive the first dose of  BNT162B2, lot number: Eh9899 on 18Dec2020 at 10:00 AM in the right arm. The vaccine was given at a Public Health Clinic. On 09Jan2021 at 12:00AM, the patient experienced myalgia, overwhelming fatigue, injection site pain and swelling. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of myalgia, overwhelming fatigue, injection site pain and swelling was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Around 2100 the same night, rapidly progressing paresthesia of complete left face without obvious facial palsy yet (numbness happened over the course of about 30min to the point where I had no perception of touch in the left face).  At this point I took 60mg of prednisone and went to bed. When I woke up, the paresthesia/stiffness was less and progressively so since finishing a course of prednisone.   Concerned that this could have been a bells palsy reaction to the vaccine.

Got tested for COVID the next morning with the rapid results and the symptoms continued with the muscle aches and severe headache. Vision became blurry and I became very dizzy. Slept for 8 hours during the day on 1/7/2021 and then slept another 12 hours that night. The body aches and headaches continued until 1/8/2021 at which the symptoms finally subsided

A 31-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose in deltoid right for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on 03Jan2021 and within 15 minutes had a generalized headache. Later that night she had generalized muscle weakness and pain, but really didn&#39;t think too much about it. The next day at work (04Jan2021), she had numbness on the right upper side of her lip and a pins and needle feeling in the right upper quadrant of the face. Had a lot of pain in the area as well on the right upper side of the face as well as a dull aching pain that lasted for hours. Later that day when using the computer and she was trying to reach for her mouse she noticed her right hand wasn&#39;t able to feel anything and that lasted about 20-25 minutes. Kept slapping the mouse with her hand, but could not feel anything, her hand went numb. Yesterday (05Jan2021), she had the same pins and needle feeling in the same area of the face and that dull achy feeling and it occurred for hours and it was very kind of debilitating for her at work.  Later that night she had pain in her right leg and felt the same way, that very severe achiness, which was the pins and needles feeling up and down the leg and underneath the right foot. All these symptoms tend to be on her right side and it definitely lasted for hours. It started about 1 and didn&#39;t end until 6-7pm. It even hurts to move the right eye in one direction and hurts to speak, the pain was so bad. This morning (06Jan2021) she had to call out of work because at 3am the generalized headache, pain was unbearable. She was still experiencing the pain in right leg and bottom sole of right foot. She did not receive any vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. She had made an appointment with a neurologist and will have a MRI done on Friday, 08Jan2021. No further details provided. All events required a visit to physician office. All events were reported as serious per medically significant. The outcome of all events was not resolved. The reporter considered all events were related to the vaccine.   Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal relationship, causality between reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                On  12/25 I was driving home and my left arm got numb, tingly and weak to the the point where I thought I was suffering from a stroke.  I  rushed to my moms and had her to drive me to the hospital where they did a neuro check to include a CT scan which ruled out the stroke but the symptoms lasted about 4 days which came and went with the pain and intensity varying each time which ended around 12/29.  I suffered from body aches and night chills one night.  Around the 12/29 I began to have pressure around the back of my head which felt as if I was laying on bricks when I laid down.  It got to the point to where I couldnt sleep which caused me to go back to the ER on  1/1 where I was given  toradol, decadron and sudafed which allowed me to sleep. I was released from the ER with Motrin 800 and contined to take that and Tylenol until the headaches ceased  which was about 3 or 4 days later. The headache went away but the pressure still remained.  My lymph glands were swollen so I was also given a prescription for amoloxicillin.

Then, 1-14-21 starting around 8am, I developed GI symptoms, stomach cramping, nausea, and also light-headed and muscle aches. I left work and at home developed a headache and fever of 100.8 F which reduced to 100.2 F with ibuprofen. The fever went away over night so I came to work the next day 1/15/21 and continue to have stomach cramping and slight nausea and was concerned about the fever the day before so that is when I called employee health.

I?ve been taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours to combat high fever but it wasn?t going down. I had chills with the fever, so bad that my body was shaking. Fever stayed in the 101 range from Monday evening until Wednesday morning. Extreme shoulder pain radiating from left to right on Monday evening - lasted into the early morning on Tuesday. Chest tightness with R shoulder pain Tuesday afternoon from roughly 130p-315p. It subsided and so I did not seek medical attention. I?ve also had a severe migraine the entire time since getting my shot, but haven?t taken my Ubrelvy as I wasn?t sure how my body would react.

Around 7:00 that night began to have back pain, fever reached up to 102 around 2:00 am and took Tylenol. Felt very weak, headache, difficulty walking and decreased balance. On Jan 5, 2021 still had back ache and headache. On Jan 6, 2021 I felt better and began to have abdominal pain after eating dinner. I assumed it may be because of eating more then I had in past few days and did not attribute to much but the pain gradually increased to a strange burning/pressure across my upper abdomen that night. Very nauseous and ran low grade fever (99.45). Next morning I had less diffuse pain and could localize it to right lower quadrant.

I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

Medical history included neuropathy and migraine.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. Patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medications included cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) and acacia senegal, ascorbic acid, betacarotene, calcium carbonate, calcium pantothenate, calcium silicate, cellulose microcrystalline, colecalciferol, croscarmellose sodium, cyanocobalamin, dextrin, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, ferrous fumarate, folic acid, gelatin, glucose, hypromellose, lecithin, macrogol, magnesium oxide, magnesium stearate, nicotinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol acetate, riboflavin, silicon dioxide, starch, thiamine mononitrate, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide (ONE-A-DAY WOMEN&#39;S) on unspecified dates for unspecified indications. The patient has not had other vaccines in four weeks. On 10Jan2021, three hours after being vaccinated (at approximately 3:00 PM), the patient experienced complete numbness to her left leg (from her ankle to her hip/waist). Hours later, the patient noted numbness to her left arm. Her left knee was buckling, making walking very difficult. The patient reported to the ER, and after several hours of waiting to be seen by a doctor, her right side also became slightly numb, and was also tingling. 18 hours after symptom onset (at approximately 9:30am, the day following injection), the numbness on her right side resolved. It was also reported that the numbness on her left side did not completely resolve for more than 24 hours.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab test which was negative on 13Jan2021 . Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included anti-anxiety medication for calming. The outcome of the events left knee was buckling, making walking very difficult and tingling was recovered on unspecified date, while the rest of the events was recovering at the time of report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported complete numbness to her left leg (from her ankle to her hip/waist)/numbness to her left arm,  left knee was buckling,  walking very difficult, right side also became slightly numb and tingling, and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.

                                                About 14 hours  after receiving the vaccine, I developed chills and felt feverish (do not own a thermometer so was unable to check temp). Throughout the night, I had chills and moderate muscle/joint pain. The following day, I had chills, muscle aches, joint pain, and a headache. I took some Tylenol and the symptoms lessened significantly. The following day (48 hrs after receiving the vaccine), I felt completely back to normal.

A 31-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL3247, Expiry date 31May2021, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Jan2021 at 07:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization as frontline worker. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Hospital. The patient reported that she was fine all day Saturday (16Jan2021), she just had some very mild pain at the injection site started a couple hours after getting injection. She developed flu like symptoms on the following day (17Jan2021) at 18:00PM and threw up a couple times. On 18Jan2021 at noon she noticed that she could barely move her arm: anything above her elbow on her right arm was not moving; it was paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up. If someone were to pick it up and let go, she couldn&#39;t control it at all. She also stated that she had no pain at all in that arm; she couldn&#39;t feel anything at all; it was numb. When she woke up on 19Jan2021 the numbness had moved up her neck, instead of being localized to her arm. She stated that when she touched her neck, it hurt a little, but it was not super significant. She stated that it was debilitating at that point as she was maintaining numbness and &#34;no control of her arm&#34;. The nurse reported that this event had not required yet a visit to physician, but she has a feeling it will. She will probably have to go somewhere due to her paralyzed arm, but she had not yet. At the time of the report the event &#34;No control of her arm&#34;/can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; had not resolved yet; the event &#34;mild pain at the injection site&#34; resolved on 17Jan2021, the events &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; and &#34;Threw up a couple times&#34; were recovering and outcome of the events &#34;Numbness has moved up her neck&#34; and &#34;She touches her neck, it hurts a little&#34; was unknown.  The reporter assessed the events &#34;Pain injection site&#34; and &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; as non-serious and assessed the event &#34;Can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; as disabling. She assessed all the reported events as related to BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events numbness of upper extremity and arm paralysis with BNT162b2 use can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The night of the second dose of my Pfizer Covid vaccine, my face began to feel hot and tight. The next day, I began with the expected flu like symptoms of the vaccine, accompanied by a red, fine bumpy rash with some swelling on my face where it had felt hot and tight the evening prior. The flu like symptoms lasted about 24 hours. The facial rash persisted and I began oral antihistamines - diphenhydramine and famotidine. The rash continued for one full week, only improving after beginning to use topical hydrocortisone on my face at the suggestion of a friend who is a nurse practitioner. After improvement in the rash I stopped hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash reappeared about 5 days later, and continues to randomly reappear about once a week to every 10 days. Flares only last about 24-36 hours now and will go away without medication but it does clear faster with hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash only flares at night, and no triggers like heat, alcohol or certain foods seem to bring it out.  I have been consistently taking famotidine and cetirizine daily since the last flare of the rash, and have not experienced a flare again yet.

Lightheaded, fatigue, chills, mild nausea, stomach cramping, and muscle weakness all hit pretty hard at once. Notice slight arm soreness as well. Went back inside and essentially collapsed on the couch 5:30pm- Arm soreness is worse. Chills and lightheadedness only mild now. Fatigue has gone down to where I can resume daily activity  12/29 Wake up with moderate sore throat Stabbing arm soreness at injection site Moderate fatigue  and nausea persist. Mild chills. Tried to go for a walk outside and found a 30 minute very slow walk extremely tough  12/30-1/2 Moderate sore throat continues. Other symptoms gone 1/1-2 Arm/ injection site soreness slowly fades  1/2: exercise for the day= 70 min yoga and 7.5 miles of walking. Had a couple glasses of wine at dinner (possibly relevant if issues with vaccine are related to high histamine food issues)  1/3  Moderate headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Skin feels hot. Sore throat worse than the previous days. Mild runny nose. Severe nausea. Go to Urgent care for COVID test and Zofran Rx. COVID rapid test and PCR test both negative. No fever, higher than usual blood pressure  1/4-5 (current) Nausea lower but still moderate, requiring Zofran. Sore throat persists. Mild fatigue and muscle aches. Skin still feels warm.

                                                Recieved the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccination on Dec 26th 2020, and had no major adverse reaction to vaccine except for mild soreness and heat around injection site and intense fatigue for three days after. Symptoms went away after the 4th day. Two weeks later on Jan 5th 2021, i began to notice an intense itching, burning, and swelling at the injection site. Pain and soreness in arm made it difficult to do my job and seem to just get worse. Upon the next morning of Jan 6th 2021, pain remained but itching had gone down, but intense burning, soreness and massive redness around injection site remained and seemed to be getting worse. Pain remains and redness has not gone down, arm is very tender near site and lifting and moving arm is very stiff and sore. Feeling of lump or stiffness on injection site comes and goes and feeling of heavy and sore muscles move from upper left arm down to elbow and extend to hand; making movement and function slowed or slightly numb. Stiffness in arm and intense heat at injection site makes it uncomfortable to move or use arm. Cold tingling sensation on occasion and stiffness in elbow joint. Slight dizziness and fatigue follow with pain in arm. Was informed to see a physician on Jan 6th, 2021 who said to fill out vaccination adverse event report and to keep an eye on arm. If pain or symptoms become worse to return.

                                                Got menstrual cycle like almost two and a half weeks early; Abdominal pain radiating to upper and middle back; Abdominal pain radiating to upper and middle back; Stomach cramps; Nausea; Fatigue; Headache; Sinus infection; The initial case was missing the following minimum criteria: Unspecified AE. Upon receipt of follow-up information on (04Jan2021), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 32-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital.  Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome.  Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA), famotidine (PEPCID), ethinylestradiol, norgestimate (CILIQUE) for birth control and multivitamin. It was stated that the patient got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. On 17Dec2020, she developed severe abdominal pain radiating to her upper and her middle back with pretty bad nausea, fatigue and headache. It was also mentioned that the patient had stomach cramps. These continued all the way until like Christmas. And then on the 19Dec2020, she actually got her menstrual cycle though she was not due to start that till that week. So, it came like almost two and a half weeks early (which was super weird as for her). The patient took ondansetron (ZOFRAN) for the nausea; aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide (MAALOX); famotidine and hyoscyamine for like stomach cramping. She also took that as well, acetaminophen (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen (MOTRIN). It was mentioned that the symptoms stopped on 26Dec2020 then she sinus infection right after in Dec 2020. Outcome of the event of sinus infection was unknown while the remaining events recovered on 26Dec2020. The patient stated that the she don&#39;t think that sinus infection was correlated at all but all other symptoms were happening right after the vaccine (reported as related).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event sinus infection is likely intercurrent and is unrelated to suspect drug BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I work as an occupational therapist in acute care. On 12/28, I was helping a patient transfer from supine to sit. She required maximal assistance, and I was briefly in an awkward position with my trunk flexed and rotated towards the right during this transfer. I felt a pull in my left lower back. After this, I iced the area and took 400 mg ibuprofen and this relieved the mild pain I had.  The following two days, I made an effort to follow back precautions (avoid bending, lifting, twisting), avoided heavy lifting at work. On 12/29 in the morning, I felt only a mild soreness in my left lower back and was able to go on my workday without issue (avoiding heavy lifting) On 12/29 around 3 pm I received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. On 12/30 (day off work) from the time I woke up until around early afternoon I felt a mild weakness and heaviness in both of my legs. It was most notable when I was standing to cook for about  20-30 minutes that my legs felt shaky and I felt the need to sit. I was able to finish cooking without sitting, however, this sensation was abnormal for me as I normally am on my feet for most of the day with an active job without feeling shaky or weak.  Around 22:00 on 12/30 I had severe nausea for about an hour or so. I can&#39;t fully remember, but several days after 12/28 or 12/29 I started to feel a mild cold sensation in my lower back. I attributed this potentially to my mild back injury, but it was unclear.  The sensory change was intermittent and mild, and ongoing until recently. On 1/9 while at work, I started to feel a mild cold sensation below my belly button, in addition to the intermittent lumbar back cold sensation area. On 1/11 at work, the sensory changes to my lower abdomen and back were more apparent after assisting in a maximal assist transfer with a patient.  At this time, it was a combination of cold and burning sensations.

                                                Severe soreness in left upper arm at location of the shot about 5 hours after the shot, the pain extended into the armpit/lymph area of my left arm and the pain remained steadily severe until Friday 1/15- 3 days after the initial injection. At 1pm on day of shot (1/12/21) had feelings of chills, sweaty and whole body aches. This lasted until Thursday morning 1/14 around 7am. During that time, took Tylenol for the aches and feverish feelings.    Arm soreness finally subsided Friday. migraines started Thursday evening into Saturday morning. With little relief from Imitrex (prescription medication for chronic migraines). Went to the emergency room Saturday for a shot of Torodal for the migraine to subside.

On 1/10 developed left upper arm, axillary, chest wall, and clavicular soft tissue swelling with significant lymphadenopathy. Lymphadenopathy was tender, multiple nodes ~2cm. Started experiencing severe sharp shooting pain and burning in similar region. On 1/11 started developing weakness in L arm and hand, with numbness in left hand. Went to urgent care on 1/11. Exam demonstrated 4/5 strength of left arm and hand. Started prednisone 40mg on 1/11. Swelling, pain, and weakness persisted. Seen in ER 1/15, exam with persistent weakness and lymphadenopathy. MRI brachial plexus performed which showed multiple enlarged nodes adjacent to brachial plexus. No overt inflammation or compression of brachial plexus. Received IV dexamethasone, and PO prednisone course. Finished 10d of prednisone 40mg with improvement in soft tissue edema, but still with residual weakness and pain. EMG pending. Diagnosed with brachial plexopathy secondary to compressive adenopathy from COVID 19 vaccine.

This nurse reported information for both mother and baby. This is the maternal case.   A 32-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 08Jan2021 at 05:45 (at the age of 32-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, non-ongoing COVID-19 from Apr2020 to an unspecified date (1.5 weeks with symptoms at 28 weeks pregnant; recovered), and breastfeeding from an unspecified date and ongoing. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications, taken within two weeks of vaccination, included labetalol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and an unspecified postnatal vitamin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and a fever of 103 F on 08Jan2021 at 19:00. The events were reported as non-serious. The currently breastfeeding mother received the vaccine on 08Jan2021 at 05:45. The clinical course was reported as follows: Approximately 12 hours (as reported) after the vaccine, the patient developed chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and a fever and body temperature of 103 F on 08Jan2021 at 19:00. The patient was treated with an unspecified antipyretic and the fever and body temperature spiked to 103 F again during the night. The next day (24-48 hours post vaccine), the patient had a fever and body temperature of 100-101.7 F on 09Jan2021, intermittently while treating with ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The chills were not as bad as before, but body aches and fatigue were still present. On 10Jan2021, over 48 hours post-vaccine, the patient felt mostly fatigued with body temperature of 99 F. At 13:00 on 10Jan2021, the fever came back at body temperature of 101.6 F, which was treated with ibuprofen. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and a fever of 103 F as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and a fever of 103 F was recovering and of currently breastfeeding mother received the vaccine was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021022120 same reporter, different patient/event (baby case)

The acute, immediate pain in the joint and inability to move my shoulder were surprising. It took me a few minutes to realize this was likely a reaction to the shot. The joint pain migrated to my elbow, wrist, hand, and left side of my neck, and those joints were all cracking for about 2 days. My left shoulder is still experiencing discomfort and cracking frequently when I move that arm.

The fever improved this morning around 9 am, however I continued to have headache, myalgia, and fatigue all day.  I also have intermittent nausea and difficulty standing or walking around because of feeling like I will pass out.  I feel slightly improved tonight but still not normal.  I called the employee health this morning to inform them.

                                                At the same day I felt my neck hurting all the way to my elbow. As the days progressed the pain got worse and I started feeling a bump on my neck. My whole left side from my neck to my elbow I would feel tremendous pain.  Days passed and nothing would get better so I spoke with my supervisor and she recommended me to go to the ER where they did some labs (blood work).  About 2 weeks later the pain in my left side subsided but the swelling on my neck and the &#34;bump&#34; never went away, although not painful. I received the second dose on 01/04/2021 and the same pain returned from my neck down to my elbow and the neck is swollen again and in pain. I decided not to go to the ER for the second dose and did not obtain medical help so far.

She went to the observation area and was feeling faint and light headed. She was taken to a separate room and she became a little faint and was given some water and kept longer for observation.  After about an hour shes feeling much better and her color as returned and only feeling slightly light-headed.

                                                The morning after I received the shot in my right arm, I woke up and jumped out of bed to turn off my alarm. My right leg buckled and completely gave out. It felt like there was not a muscle or bone in the leg. I  melted down on top of my leg, twisting my ankle and my knee. I ended up with my knee twisted behind me as I hit the floor and my nightstand. I don&#39;t know if you would call it muscle fatigue or weakness, it felt like muscle paralysis, but it only lasted less than a minute before it was gone, however, the damage was already done. I hurt my knee very badly because I had no control over my leg muscles. I&#39;ve never had anything like that happen before.

                                                Approx 9 hours after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, I began having uncontrollable chills, could not get warm, spiked a fever of 100.4, severe body aches, barely could not move.  It was all I could do to finish my shift at work, drive home, get in the shower, and pass out in bed to sleep.  I slept a good solid 10 hours, woke up for work...fever was then gone and chills, but I had a severe headache, still had severe body aches/fatigue, but I also lost my sense of taste and smell.  I ate a waffle which tasted like cardboard, drank cranberry juice (my mouth puckered like it was tart, but I could not taste it at all).  I reported to work but was immediately sent home by my employee health nurse to be seen by a health care provider and to be tested for COVID-19.  I went home and slept an additional 5 hours, did not do anything at home but rest, and slept a solid 12 hours straight that night.  Still could not smell and taste.  The following day, I could smell things like Vicks vapor rub and I could taste things minimally like when I initially bit into them, or on the back end if that makes sense.  Still had body aches and fatigue, but nothing like that previous day or the night before that.  I was then told that evening my PCR test was negative, and I could report to work the following day.  1/14/2021, I felt almost completely back to normal, and I could smell and taste.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

                                                About 12 hours after the vaccine, I started developing chills and joint pain.  That night, I developed fevers that persisted for about 24h (spiked about 5 separate times - highest fever was 102). Then, on the third night after the vaccine (about 60 hours post vaccine), I had two separate episodes of night sweats (clothes were drenched, no fever). Later that night I had a bowel movement with bright red blood.  I then went to an urgent care where they drew labs, send a Covid swab, ordered stool studies, and ordered a CT abdomen.

                                                On Tuesday 12/28 I started to have severe leg pain in my right leg.  The next morning the pain was still in the right leg and had moved up through my right side in my joints to my knee, hip then went to the with shoulder down that arm.  My forearm became very painful on 12/30 and started to swell then radiated into my wrist joint and finger joints.  12/31 the pain continued in all those areas and had moved to my left side of my body starting with the left arm following the same course as the right side.  On 1/1 the pain has persisted and I am unable to perform any ADL&#39;s.  I saw an urgent care physician who told me to take ibuprofen.  I have been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol with no relief. Now all my joints are swelling in bilateral hands, wrist.  On 1/2 my bilateral ankle joints and feet started to have similar pain.  Know all my extremities are difficult to use and it is hard to walk due to the pain.  Because of the pain in my hands things feel heavier than what they should.  I am a medical provider and this almost seems like polyarthralgia rheumatica, I am going to go see a physician on Monday

Did not improve after trying to shake arm/move around , and took prednisone 40mg oral. Went to ER and had CT Cspine which did not show evidence of cervical pathology. Continued with corticosteroids, sought consultation with PMR and neurology specialists, and steroid dose increased to 60mg/day.   Some improvement in strength , but still have diminished sensation and strength in left hand/arm. Unable to perform full job tasks as I am left hand dominant.  Likely brachial neuritis / parsonage turner syndrome per both specialists seen. Continuing with corticosteroids at this time, pending bloodwork and OT evaluation

My injection site (Left deltoid) was swollen and sore, although not more than usual after receiving a vaccine. I had no headache at all. The major concern was the fever and the backaches. I could not get warm, and I was shaking badly because I was so cold. I had ZERO relief despite taking 700 Mg of Tylenol. Side effects finally subsided after about 5 hours.

It lasted until about 24 hours after the vaccine. Over the last week, I?ve had horrible insomnia, waking up multiple times throughout the night with difficulty falling back asleep. I didn?t think much of it other than it?s very unlike me until a handful of other coworkers vaccinated around the same have also been experiencing this.

Two days after my first dose I felt like I was underwater when talking to people, as their speech was distorted. I also felt pressure in my ear, as if it was filled with fluid, and was unable to &#34;pop&#34; my ears. I was evaluated by an ENT and there was no infection or fluid in my ear. It started to get better a little.  After my second dose, the symptoms worsen. My hearing loss was back worse than the original time and this time I had tinnitus constantly. I also had chills, fevers, myalgia, back pain, and headaches.

Her Lupus had been under control, but this was the worst flare-ups that she has had. She said she could not even move and her husband had to pick her up. She had head to toe joint pain and rated this a 10. She also had had headache and extreme fatigue. She saw a physician and she was tested for Covid, strep and influenza, which were all negative. She was prescribed emergency steroids.   She did not miss any work because she was on scheduled PTO time. Saw her Rheumatologist ion 1/6 and her hydroxy-chloroquine dose was doubled. Still having fatigue, headaches and joint pains, which she said are not her usual Lupus symptoms. She saw her Rheumatologist again yesterday and he is recommending that she not receive the second vaccine dose.

The dull or faint pain is not constant and I will randomly feel it since receiving the vaccine.

                                                At around 11:45pm tingling started in my left eyebrow. I thought there was something in my eyebrow and after time of wiping it a few times I went to look into the mirror and realized that nothing was there. about and hour later I got a drink and a snack to eat and I realized I had a numb sensation in the left corner of my lip.  As a nurse I went though the signs of a stroke with 2 other nurses I called. Everything was normal other than that sensation. Thinking I was just overly tired I went to bed. When I woke up the next day I felt okay until I went to drink some coffee and the numb sensation in my corner lip was still there. Now I was concerned and called employee health and was instructed to go to the ER to role out a stoke. I followed employee health&#39;s instructions and went to the ER. I was diagnosed with facial paresthesia and discharged with instructions to come back if symptoms got worse.  Symptoms persisted all day and around 7 I called my mom on video chat to show a visual facial twitch on the left side of my face. right after I got off the phone with her the left side of my face drooped and my fiance immediately drove me to the closest ER. I was seen immediately and they decided to admit me. The did labs and head CT. They admitted me to labor and delivery because there were no other rooms. The next day I was seen by a neurologist and many doctors.

Shortly after this I had moderate GI upset including diarrhea, cramping for about 24 hours.  Over the course of 48 hours after the vaccine I had swelling at the injection site, tenderness of the injection area to the point where I was not able to put pressure on the area or sleep on my left side and severe fatigue/malaise.    All symptoms resolved after 48 hours.  I am a person and wanted the reaction information to be part of the trial data.

This 34-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 at 08:00AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The first dose was received on 16Dec2020 at 7:40 AM at single dose. Vaccine location was in the left arm. The patient was vaccinated at hospital, age at vaccination was 34-years-old. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included ongoing fluticasone proprionate (FLONASE) for seasonal allergy taking for two years. On 17Dec2020, COVID-19 PCR test was negative.  On 04Jan2021 at night, she experienced myalgia, fever, chills, back pain and started with a constant ringing in her right ear and the hearing loss that worsened from before (started on 18Dec2020 after first dose, see AER # 2021012126). Start date of constant ringing in right ear was 05Jan2021. The events resulted in Physician Office visit. Hearing loss in right ear worsened and constant ringing in right ear were reported serious as medically significant while the other events were reported as non-serious. She went to see an ENT doctor and get a hearing test. The hearing test showed moderate hearing loss and speech clarity of 96% in her left ear compared to 52% in the right ear. They don&#39;t know if it is permanent. She is currently being treated with 80mg of Prednisone daily by mouth and getting dexamethasone injections to her middle eardrum. All of these effects have resolved except the hearing loss and ringing in her ear.   All the events were considered related to the vaccine per reporter.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Medical history included seasonal allergy.  Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate  for seasonal allergy. The day after vaccination she noticed soreness of the left arm. Then two days later she noticed hearing loss secondary to a feeling of fullness in her ear; it felt like fluid in her right ear which has improved and she states it was not serious after the first dose. Patient received the second dose of vaccine on 04Jan2021 at 08:00AM in the left arm. That night she experienced myalgia, fever, chills, back pain, and started with a constant ringing in her right ear and the hearing loss that worsened from before (reported under AER 2021012152.

Patient informed that on 17Dec2020 she was tested for COVID 19 with the PCR test due to an exposure at work. The result was negative. The patient recovered from soreness in the left arm on 19Dec2020. The patient had not yet recovered from deafness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events ear congestion and hearing loss unilateral cannot be excluded.

                                                Beginning 12 hours after my 2nd dose, I woke up with myalgias, chills, and drenching sweats on 1/9. Later that morning 6:30am, I developed severe fatigue, dizziness upon standing and walking,  a L sided headache, L sided arm pain extending from elbow to sternocleidomastoid muscles on the L side, and axillary lymphadenopathy in the same arm as the vaccine (left). I took 650mg of Tylenol and went to work. Walking at a normal pace, my heart rate was 145. At rest inside the hospital it was in the 110s (measured by watch). the headache lasted all day on 1/9 and 1/10 and my neck felt slightly stiff (it was difficult to turn my head to look at traffic behind while driving). I took additional doses of Tylenol on 1/9 and 1/10 and by the AM of 1/11, all of my symptoms had resolved except for the L axillary lymphadenopathy.

                                                After the vaccine was administered the patient sat in the waiting room for less than 5 minutes and then felt a fast HR, she felt hot and was worried that she was going to faint. She also felt shaking in her hands and her arms felt heavy.   She came back to the nurse that had administered her vaccine at 1:10pm where her oxygen level was monitored and she was given a cold cloth and water to drink. This lasted for about 20 minutes. Her oxygen level was monitored (~97%), her BP was checked at 1:45pm and it was 125/90. Her hotness, elevated HR, and shakes went away. At 2:00pm her BP was checked again and it was 139/96 and then again at 2:05pm where it was 132/90.   The patient stated that she felt fine and normal by now and also said that she had a BP cuff at work and at home and said that she would monitor it. All 3 of 3 follow up options discussed with patient: virtual care, the CDC, and/or 911 depending on her condition. The patient left at 2:15pm and patient was called 1 hour later for follow up.  On the follow-up call the patient stated that she was feeling fine and that her BP was 126/90. She said she would continue to monitor her BP and follow-up with virtual health if it wasn&#39;t back to normal by tomorrow.

                                                I started experiencing soreness to left arm about 1-2 hours after injection but nothing else. I went to bed around 11pm. Then I was woken up in the night around 3am violently shaking, teeth shattering and unable to even stand straight from shaking so bad. I felt like I was freezing but skin was hot to touch. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take temperature at that time because it was in another family member&#39;s room. I felt nauseated as well. I took 600mg ibuprofen and tried to lay back down. At 3:59am my aunt woke and brought the thermometer downstairs. I could tell the ibuprofen was working some and fever was less as the shaking had calmed. I was able to check my temperature and it was 100.8F (an hour after the ibuprofen). I still took 100mg tylenol at that time.  As of this morning (after 7am) I am sore all over, tired and have a headache, temp 99.2F.

By 9am I started to feel muscle aches and sharp joint pain, as expected. By 1200 noon, the pain intensity was increasing, coming in waves, lasting 10-15 minutes. The pain waves were 10/10, very severe, and was causing me to shake, cry, and be unable to function or sleep. I was also very disoriented, but I think due to the pain. It was mildly relieved with ibuprofen/Tylenol alternating every 3hrs, but continued until 6pm. It began to subside at 6pm.  I am an RN, and sought the advice of my employee health nurse, who advised me to seek medical care if it continued through the night. The pain began to subside, so I did not. However, if a  non-healthcare person experiences that, they will think they are dying.

A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular on 05Jan2021 at 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Mild ADHD/ADD. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving vaccination, she was standing in the observation room (where they had all of them stay for at least 15 minutes to ensure no severe reactions) and experienced a sudden onset of vertigo, tunnel vision and pre-syncope. Her hands became cold and numb and she was trying to talk to another staff member who was arranging/scheduling her second vaccination dose at the same time when this event occurred, but it subsided quickly and she started to feel normal again. All these events occurred at 12:45 on 05Jan2021. She reported this event right away and they had her stay in the room longer. She was stable at that point but experienced these symptoms again but very mildly twice more while she walked back to her car to go home. Other side effects on 05Jan2021 that started in the evening and for the following 2-3 days included fatigue, sore arm, leg/thigh aching, sniffles/sore throat, brief dry cough and slight headache/neck ache. Very mild and tolerable symptoms. All events were reported as non-serious by reporter. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and the patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of all events was resolved in Jan2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

We pulled into the waiting area and around five minutes after the injection the right side of my face went numb., the pain had left my arm and chest by the time.  The nurse reacted by calling the emergency room and sending me there.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

                                                About 15 min I felt numbness and tingling on my face. Gradually  felt it in my whole body by 8:30PM that night, next day I tried to go to work but I had to leave because of the intense numbness and tingling. I also developed left leg weakness and had to even pick up my leg to be able to walk. The NP at my neurologist office (talked over the phone) said it was a pseudo effect due to my MS. My symptoms are still intermittent up to my second dose.  It is all over the numbness and tingling, but as it is subsiding it is now flaring up my symptoms from 2 years ago and I feel it on my second side.

I can?t think straight and it takes me longer to process and do tasks. I woke up 2 hours ago and I can?t wait to sleep again.

On 24Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient experienced chills and had a feeling like a heavy weight on her body. On 24Jan2021 at 07:00, the patient had a fever and headache. On 24Jan2021, she also had back pain. The clinical course was as follows: On 23Jan2021, the patient took paracetamol before getting the vaccine as she heard one can feel sore after getting it. The patient received the second dose on 23Jan2021 at 15:20. The patient was okay after she got the vaccine. However, early the next morning (24Jan2021), she had shivering without any fever (later referred to as chills). The chills were something she never experienced in her life. It was like she was in the cold. She could not move, it was that bad. She felt a heavy weight on her whole body. She could not get out of bed.  A few hours later at 07:00, she checked her temperature and it was 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She took paracetamol. The headache started with the fever around 07:00. She stated she kept taking paracetamol. She did try to stop using paracetamol, but without it, the headache was still there. The back pain was also severe on 25Jan2021. The chills recovered on 25Jan2021 and the fever was recovered on 26Jan2021. The clinical outcomes of the headache and felt like a heavy weight on the body were unknown; while that of the back pain was not recovered. The events of chills, fever, headache, and back pain were reported as serious by the patient (nurse) for being medically significant. The patient (nurse) assessed the events of chills, fever, headache, back pain, and felt like a heavy weight on her body were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known BNT162B2 vaccine safety profile causality between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

                                                Vaccination was at 9:17am. Injection site arm pain and stiffness was noticeable by 12pm, and gradually worsened to incredibly painful by 8 pm, especially in muscles between left  shoulder blade and spine. Chills began around 9:30pm at which point I took one 500mg Tylenol and went to sleep. I woke up with severe chills around 1:45 am and pushed off taking more 500mg Tylenol until 2:45 am. Afterwards I began to feel heartburn and slight nausea but was able to fall back to sleep. I woke up around 3:45 am to vomit. Afterwards, the nausea subsided and I was able to go back to sleep until 6:45am. I woke up with a headache which got worse and I took one Aleve at 9 am. By late afternoon I was feeling much better.

Vomiting was for 3 days. I did seek medical attention; zofran and flexeril.  *urgent care **not taking 2nd vaccination. Personal preference. &#39;Not worth it to go thru that again&#39;.

                                                On Saturday morning I woke up with a headache and swollen lymph nodes in my neck/collarbone area. As the day progressed, I began to have pain in my joints and muscles. I felt very tired all day as well. I also experienced skin sensitivity which basically just made my skin hurt if anything/one touched me. Sunday my headache persisted, still had pain at injection site and felt warm to the touch. Swollen lymph nodes also still there and fatigue. Monday morning symptoms of headache, injection site pain and warmth and swollen lymph nodes still felt.  Taking Tylenol to help with headache, warm compresses to help swollen lymph nodes and ice pack for injection site pain.

Starting Tuesday morning, for three days, I got calf/feet cramps that were non-stop. I did call my doctor and got lab work done on 12-31. This lab work showed some kidney values that were off. Starting Sunday my legs and feet swelled up. I had a routine MS appointment on Monday and they stated since there is no data for folks with MS and the vaccine that they cannot rule out the vaccine is playing a role in some of this along with the IVIG.  I did follow up with my primary care doctor on Tuesday and they re did lab work as well as did a ultrasound to rule out blood clots. She did state she felt like it was the perfect storm between the COVID vaccine and then the Immunoglobins that I am on.  She suggested I download the app for CDC and report those items as well.  The doctors are still suggesting I get the 2nd shot just have to do some things prior to the second shot.

                                                1. Noticing a sharp headache for about 10 seconds either in the occipital lobe region or temporal lobe region on the right side of my head every now and then. It has happened about 8 times since vaccine administration. The first time being about 25-30 minutes after vaccination. 2. I have also noticed a sharp pain in the back of my right thigh/upper buttock region that feels either like a nerve or muscle pain. It usually is most noticeable when I first stand up from a sitting position or laying position. If I don&#39;t put as much pressure on the heel of my right foot, it isn&#39;t as bad and ibuprofen has helped the pain subside, but it has been constant. This was first noticed about 4-5 hours after vaccination received.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5703), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 15Dec2020 17:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Administration was done in the hospital. Medical history included seronegative rheumatoid arthritis and allergies to latex and actemra. Concomitant medication included tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ), and ibuprofen. Eight days after vaccination, on 23Dec2020 at 13:30, the patient came down with fever, chills, body aches, joint pain. The patient was initially tested negative for COVID (nasal swab) and influenza on 27Dec2020 but did test positive for COVID-19 on 29Dec2020 (nasal swab). The patient stated that she knew that the vaccine did not cause COVID however as she was on immunosuppressants (Xeljanz), she wanted to record this information. There was no treatment included for the events. The outcome of the events was recovering. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                About 40 minutes after my vaccine, I felt sudden onset progressive weakness of my entire left arm with spasms/fasciculations of my forearm and hand  (while driving from hospital where I work as a physician to where I live). I pulled over, felt a bit dazed and was unable to use my left hand purposefully to call 911 on my cell phone, but was able to call 911 on my Watch using my right (dominant) hand. While talking to the dispatcher, my symptoms resolved (total duration a few minutes)  so I requested that they not send an ambulance but instead felt well enough to drive to my hospital ED. I discussed my case with the triage RN and ED attending who felt my symptoms were related to the vaccine, with no further work up needed, given then my symptoms resolved. My vitals were stable in triage.  No chest pain or shortness of breath, with normal neurological function and sensation of my left arm.  Note: I was not officially checked in or seen as a patient.     Sudden onset weakness and spasms of left arm (side of vaccine administration) about 40 minutes after vaccine

This was approx 16 hours post dose. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and felt more able to do normal home activities but still tired with a sore arm. 4.5 hours post ibuprofen dose I again had muscle aches, headache, fatigue, and nausea. I also had chills and joint pain. I napped for an hour, took another 600mg ibuprofen, and then napped for another 2.5 hours. After that I felt better at 27 hours post dose but still achy and fatigued. These symptoms had mostly resolved by 31 hours post dose.

                                                I received my second vaccine on Friday 1/8. I felt fine until that evening and then experienced the typical side effects that I had read about. Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP and they said to call employee health.

                                                I received my second vaccine on Friday 1/8. I felt fine until that evening and then experienced the typical side effects that I had read about. Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Axillary lymph node is larger than a marble currently.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP with the above complaints who referred me to employee health.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site. The event swollen lymph nodes worsened. The outcome of &#34;injection site itched a little bit&#34; was unknown.   The reporter considered the events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were all related to the vaccine; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, chills, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, bone pain, headache, lymphadenopathy, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site pain, blood pressure decreased, tachycardia, grunting and vaccination site pruritus cannot be excluded.

Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the Bell&#39;s palsy and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  However, the Bell&#39;s palsy may possibly represent a concurrent medical condition.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including viral serologies, and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                12 hours post vaccine developed severe muscle and bone pain and a fever, took 1000 mg of Tylenol 17 hours post vaccine and the fever broke, but the pain persisted. Took Ibuprofen 20 hours post vaccine because I developed a severe headache in addition to nausea. Headache became less intense, but all other symptoms remained at the same intensity. I fell asleep and woke up with a 103F at 28 hours. Pain persisted as well. I went back to sleep and woke up at 7pm when the fever broke, I noticed all the other symptoms were gone except for some new neck pain. The neck pain could be related to how I slept though since it was new. I did not take any more medication and went back to bed later in the evening. I woke up at 4am, roughly 29 hours post vaccine, with a fever and didn&#39;t take my temperature, but did take 1000 mg Tylenol. It broke an hour later. I have had waves of symptoms of a low grade fever all day (slight chills), which then feels like it breaks on its own indicated by sweat and chills disappearing. I haven&#39;t had to medicate any further however and in comparison to yesterday I feel amazing!

A 35-year-old female patient (weight 55.79 kg, height 160 cm) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EK5730) intramuscularly, in the left deltoid, at single dose, on 23Dec2020 at 12:30, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were none. On 25Dec2020, the patient felt extremely tired (fatigue). On 28Dec2020, the patient had headache and minor cough noticed. On 29Dec2020, the patient experienced back pain and she said that it felt like sunburn soreness more than anything else. She said that she literally slept 3 days in a row (29Dec2020, 30Dec2020, and 31Dec2020).  On 31Dec2020, the patient lost her sense of smell and developed dizziness. On 01Jan2021, the patient experienced nausea and lost her sense of taste. COVID-19 virus test was found positive on 01Jan2021.The patient recovered from back pain, sunburn and sleepy on 31Dec2020, recovered from tiredness on 01Jan2021, recovered from nausea and dizziness on 06Jan2021. Clinical outcome of the events, smell loss, cough, headache, and loss of taste was recovering. Final clinical outcome of positive COVID-19 test with symptoms was unknown at time of this report. The case was assessed as serious (medically significant). She is scheduled to get 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) on 13Jan2021 and is wanting to know if she is supposed to get it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                Headache developed before 7pm. Chills soon after for the remainder of the night. Woke up the next morning feeling like hit by a bus with so many muscle aches. Also was warm/hot most of the day. Didn&#39;t feel good in general. Headache came and went most of the day. The next morning still felt &#39;off&#39;, but not horrible like the previous day.

She has numbness and loss of sensation in whole left side of body, limp and sluggish.  Went to ER 01/18/20 and they thought was overload of immune system.  They suggested her to report.  Symptoms did not subside until 01/22/21, gradually the feeling came back, with rest.  She was off work the last week to rest up.

Currently in inpatient acute rehab to re learn how to walk. Sharp painful neuropathy ongoing.

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

Aching has been ongoing and intermittent.  1/17/21 Developed left ear &#34;fullness&#34;.  On 1/20/21 went to GYN for exam, explained left underarm pain, told that my breast exam appeared normal, but she questioned if my left ear fullness and left under arm pain were related.  1/21/21 Left Ear &#34;fullness&#34; began to radiated causing left temporal pressure, spreading across forehead.  Pressure developed behind both eyes.  Sudden onset of dizziness occurred.  Went to urgent care where they said I had swollen lymph nodes and believed I was having a auto immune response to something.  Told I received the vaccine on 1/7/21, they said the symptoms could be related to the vaccine.  1/22/21 Notice I would occasionally feel like I had a &#34;lump or pressure&#34; to the side of my throat.   As of present I am continuing to have Left  Ear &#34;fullness&#34;, left underarm aching, and bilateral eye pressure has bee intermittent yet ongoing.

                                                I developed significant joint pain in my knees approximately 3 days after my second COVID19 vaccination. I have no history of joint pain and have no recent changes in my activity level or medical history. Even walking as a casual pace causes pain. It is not severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living, but it is certainly noticeable. I cannot think of any other potential cause of this pain. The it has been approximately 4 days since this pain began, and it has not improved.

When I went fir 2nd shot I asked pharmacist administering shot abs he said last time they may have hit a nerve I had no other side affects so I got second dose. Approximately 3/4 days after second dose on February right fingers became more numb and on  2/15 numbness started in left hand as well.

Later that evening my injection site was sore, itchy, and raised, like a hive.  On 2/23/21 I woke up at about 7:30AM and the injection site was the same as before, but I also had a sore/stiff neck and headache at the base of my skull.  The reactions have not warranted a trip to the doctor, but I remember hearing somewhere that the CDC was interested to know about any side effects that may be related to the vaccine.

A 35-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 14:30 (2:30 PM) at single dose on left deltoid for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type is hospital. No history of previous immunization and no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect, also reported as &#34;Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None&#34;. Medical history included ongoing Vitamin D deficiency for quite a few years.  Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) from Oct2020 and ongoing at 50000 IU gel cap, once weekly for Vitamin D deficiency. Patient is scheduled to receive the second dose of Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021 but reported side effects from her first shot including bruising near the injection site, shortness of breath, muscle tenderness and elevated heart rate (main concern). Upon contacting her HCP, she mentioned that this may be a side effect of her anxiety medications and asked &#34;Should she take the second dose?&#34;. Approximately 22hours (13Jan2021) after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. COVID-19 vaccine injection site became red, warm, and itchy, also experienced blood pressure increased, shortness of breath and Clammy, all on 13Jan2021. The patient was pale on 13Dec2020. Patient noticed on Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Friday morning (15Jan2021) that the lymph nodes in her left axillary (or armpit area) were swollen, and super tender (onset reported as &#34;Jan2021&#34;). Patient became sweaty on 14Jan2021. It was further reported that patient received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021 2:30PM . She said after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine, she has had multiple symptoms. Patient is now due for her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose today 02Feb2021. Patient did not know if she should get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and if her side effects were from the first COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient works in a doctor&#39;s office where there is a medical doctor, nurse practitioner, and several other registered medical assistants. Approximately 12 hours later after vaccine, at 2:30AM (13Jan2021), her left arm was extremely sore. She said she went to work on Wednesday, 13Jan2021, and her left arm was still really sore, but she was fine, otherwise. She said approximately 22 hours after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection site. She said her COVID-19 Vaccine was given a lot higher than she thinks the vaccine should have been given. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site became red, warm, and itchy. Her heart rate and blood pressure shot up, and she had pretty bad shortness of breath. Patient said that the medical doctor and nurse practitioner (where she works) told her she gave herself a panic attack. She said that the medical doctor, who she works for, told her to go home, and to contact her primary care doctor if she doesn&#39;t feel better. Patient left work and went home. Patient clarified her heart rate was in the 120s, and she usually has a heart rate in the 80s. She said she was pale and clammy, too. Patient stated that she went to bed when she got home from work on 13Jan2021, and woke up the next morning (Thursday, 14Jan2021), and got ready for work. She said as she was getting dressed for work, she felt her pulse rate go up, and she became sweaty, and clammy. She said she called her work, and her boss (medical doctor) told her to take some Tylenol and rest, and to call her primary care doctor if she was not feeling better. Patient said that her primary care doctor said she was having anxiety, and started her on medicine. She said the medicine helped, but her heart rate was still 112-115. She said she noticed on Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Friday morning (15Jan2021) the lymph nodes in her left axillary (or armpit area) were swollen, and super tender. She said all the muscles in her left arm were tender, as well. She said her left arm muscles were still aching. She said she had bruising on her left arm, and noticed she had bruising (more than usual) throughout the rest of her body. She said she has no idea if the bruising is a coincidence, or if the bruising is related to receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient mentioned that her left axillary lymph nodes were swollen for a good week and a half, but the swelling improved and was gone now. She said her heart rate was still elevated at 106-110 when she last checked her heart rate an hour and half ago. She said her heart rate was elevated, even though she was sitting down doing tele-work, and she has been taking anxiety medicine. She said she was still having breathing discomfort, clarifying she could not take a big enough breath. Patient will take a big breath, and will be good for a while, but then she needs to take another big breath. She said her doctor has checked her lungs, and her lungs were clear. She said she has to take multiple, deep breaths throughout the day. Patient&#39;s last blood work was in Oct2020. She said everything was good with her blood work. She said her hormones were good, but she had a Vitamin D deficiency. For treatment, patient stated that her primary care doctor prescribed Buspar 7.5mg, twice a day. She said the Buspar 7.5mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle and did not have the NCD, Lot, and Expiration Date. She said it will be 3 weeks from tomorrow (03Feb2021) she has been taking the Buspar 7.5mg and reported everyone seems to think she has anxiety, or she was crazy. Events did not require emergency room visit but patient visited physician office. There were no relevant tests. Outcome of muscles in her left arm were tender/aching, was not recovered, for axillary lymph nodes swelling and tender was recovered in 2021, for heart rate was elevated, Shortness of breath/breathing discomfort was recovering while for other events was unknown.

Flushing of hands; Dizziness; Fatigue; Legs became heavy; Joint stiffness of hands; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ 1685), intramuscular on the left arm on 23Dec2020 at 06:30 AM in a hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies of seasonal allergies, cats, and metals; migraines, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and angioedema. The patient was not pregnant and did not have any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination and did not test positive to COVID post vaccination (also reported as not been tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination). Concomitant medication included propranolol, cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), and sertraline (reported as other medications in two weeks). On 23Dec2020 at 06:45 AM, the patient experienced immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands; flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands. She was monitored by colleagues for an hour, prescription for Epi pen refilled, and available angioedema and fatigue persisted for three days. It was reported that the patient was not treated for the adverse events but it was also reported that the AE treatment also included X-ray and antibiotic. Outcome of the events was recovered in Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands, flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

It quickly went down hill with a fever, chills, worsening joint and muscle pain everywhere, nausea, severe fatigue, worsening sore throat, tingling and numbness in all extremities at random locations. It is now 3pm, about 21 hours since vaccination-fever has broken once (I took ibuprofen at 2pm) but returned but not as high, and severe headache with light sensitivity. The joint pain and numbness has faded but I am left with severe muscle soreness, like I was in a car accident. Oh and I lost taste sometime today. Also I had injection site pain for both doses, starting the morning after.

Felt like it spread through my body,  I felt a weird feeling in my chest, throat, my legs felt weak, I was light headed and my heart started to beat hard and fast. It then started to subside over several minutes. The nurse kept me for 30 minutes and then I felt ok to walk out. I had a bit of a headache and didn?t feel right the rest of the night.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EJ1685) intramuscular at arm left, on 19Dec2020 06:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing acne. Patient had no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medication included isotretinoin (ACCUTANE). On 19Dec2020 11:30, approximate 5 hours after vaccine, the patient experienced pain, joint pain and tenderness at injection site, progressively loss of strength and eventually inability to move arm. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EL1284, expiry date not provided) on 23Dec2020 09:15 intramuscularly in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as preventive). There was no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The nurse (patient) received her first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at the hospital that she worked at. She was kept there for 15 min for monitoring and she felt fine. About 30 minutes post vaccination she got a hot flash, a flush over her face, she does not know if she was red but she felt flush. Her tongue felt strange, nothing swelled that she could tell, it felt hard to swallow, to make the motion to swallow it felt kind of sluggish. She felt weird swallowing which lasted for only a few minutes. She never struggled to breathe. She went back to park in the hospital parking lot since she was not sure if she was experiencing a anaphylactic reaction and then after a few minutes it went away. Her arm was sore and heavy feeling for that day. She had drowsiness for a couple of hours and pain and redness at the injection site for a couple of days that was not bothersome, it was mild. No relevant test. She wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine due to the symptoms she had after the first dose. The pain and redness at injection site was resolved on an unspecified date in Dec2020, while the other events were resolved on 23Dec2020.  The reporting nurse considered the events hot flash, flush all over her face, arm was sore and heavy, drowsiness, pain and redness at injection site were non-serious, while the events &#34;tongue felt strange, it was sluggish to swallow&#34; were serious that she drove back to the hospital (no emergency room/phycian office visit). She considered the events were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162Bw on the reported events cannot be excluded.

                                                Inital onset of arm tenderness then heaviness in left arm. This was followed by increased weakness and tingling in entire left side. I found it difficult to ambulate and lift my arm at all. This was followed by malaise, weakness, and fatigue. The decreased strength and sensation on the left side of my body lasted for several hours, gradually fading around 4am. The weakness of the left side of the body improved over time and I was just left with fatigue and malaise.

                                                Patient experienced a syncopal episode post vaccination, accompanied by feeling hot and tachycardic. Prior to the syncope, she reported hyperventilating. She remained unresponsive for about 10 minutes and was brought to the ED. There she became responsive, and reported chest pain and had sinus tachycardia episodes. She also had lower extremity weakness. This has improved per the latest neurology notes. She also had a negative EEG. Unsure if this is an allergic reaction or if the syncope was due to hyperventilation.  Patient is currently on day 3 of hospitalization.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

                                                My first dose of COVID vaccine I didn&#39;t have any symptoms (1st dose: 12/23/20). Received 2nd dose at 0800 on 1/12/21. First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

                                                got the covid 19 vaccine on 21Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 24Dec2020; got the covid 19 vaccine on 21Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 24Dec2020; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient) from a Pfizer-sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EK5730), via intramuscular in left deltoid  on 21Dec2020 10:00 at 0.3 ml, single for precaution as front line healthcare worker in hospital which is not a military facility.  Medical history included nonsmoker. She did not provide causality but stated that she probably already had COVID when she got the vaccine. It was unknown if the patient had SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis as she had never been tested. Other history was none. The patient did not have a history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease, cancer, immunosuppressive disorder, obesity. There was not any pre-existing diseases worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection. The patient hadn&#39;t been treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. Concomitant medication included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN SR), sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL). Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were none. AE following prior vaccinations were none. There was no additional vaccines administered on Same Date (21Dec2020) of the Pfizer bnt162b2. The patient got the covid 19 vaccine on 21Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 24Dec2020. The patient wanted guidance on receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine. The reporter considered event was non-serious. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 21Dec2020, and after that on 24Dec2020, she tested positive for COVID . She was supposed to be revaccinated on 07Jan2021. She would like to know if she should she get this or does she need to be revaccinated. There is no prescriber. She received it through her work. She received the first dose on 21Dec2020, and assumed she was positive when she got it. She just had cough and muscle aches and a headache. Her dad was hospitalized. Hers was not that serious. She had not completely recovered yet. Her smell had not come back yet and she was just tired still. She said the headache was prior to getting vaccine. She did not provide causality but stated that she probably already had COVID when she got the vaccine. The cough occurred on 25Dec2020, muscle aches on 22Dec2020 at 08:00. There was no emergency room of or physician&#39;s office required for the events. The patient was not hospitalized or admitted to an ICU. Nasal swab test done. Imaging for COVID-Pneumonia, other radiological investigations, hematology, clinical chemistry, inflammatory markers, urinalysis, evidence of hypoxemia, other relevant test were none. The patient did not display clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow or ECMO) or receive mechanical ventilation. The patient did not receive any additional therapies for COVID-19. The event did not require the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure.  She did start taking extra vitamins on her own. The patient was recovered with some lasting effects such as not being able to smell and is tired still.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported COVID with symptoms and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, bnt162b2.  However, as the reporter claimed &#34;she probably already had COVID when she got the vaccine&#34;, this may provide  an alternative explanation.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 14Jan2021 18:25 at 0.3 mL, single for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Bactrim and experienced allergy. The patient reported she did develop some side effects, but the hospital she received the vaccine at didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. She reported that a minute or two minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (14Jan2021), her heart rate became very fast, it went into like the 150&#39;s. She started feeling jittery, lightheaded, and she had some weakness of her lower extremities. She also felt nauseated. She didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath; she thinks she was okay there. She clarified that she had her mask on and they told her to remove her mask and to breathe, breathe, breathe. She had a pulse oximeter on, and her levels were always at 98, 96. She was told to sit still, and she was given water. Her heart rate went down to 76. She was fine and then after 5 minutes, she had the same reaction again. Her heart rate this time was in the 120&#39;s. She was lightheaded, cold, jittery. She did the same thing again and waited another 5- 10 minute. She felt better but was still nauseated, lightheaded, and really, really cold. She was kept there for 45 minutes. After that, she still did not feel 100%. Currently, she still does not feel 100% well. She was okay, she thinks she was okay. She explains they wanted to send her to the ER (emergency room) but she declined. Her heart rate had improved, she wasn&#39;t feeling like she was going to pass out. She wasn&#39;t experiencing shortness of breath, she wasn&#39;t throwing up, she didn&#39;t have a rash, her throat wasn&#39;t closing up, so she went back to work. She further stated that she came back home. Her heart rate was a little faster, but it wasn&#39;t as high as it had been. She still felt a little bit of weakness. At night (14Jan2021), she probably had a fever, she doesn&#39;t know. She was really thirsty and very hot. Because she was not feeling well, she didn&#39;t get up and drink anything. This morning (15Jan2021), she feels a little better. If she is doing her normal activities, she does get tired. She feels like she is running and is like &#34;okay I feel tired&#34;. She has a little bit of weakness in her lower extremities. She was given information for reporting side effects, but because she wasn&#39;t feeling well, she didn&#39;t do any of it. She checked her heart rate today (15Jan2021) and it&#39;s at 76. She added that when she moves a lot, she feels tired and she doesn&#39;t know why. She&#39;s normally a very active person. She is no longer jittery, but still feels lightheaded. She has a little bit of nausea. She felt hungry so she made a shake and it&#39;s not like she is going to throw up, but she is still feeling yucky. She still has a little weakness of her lower extremities. They feel light, she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it. She is just a little bit concerned because this is a new vaccine. The outcome of event heart rate increased was recovering; outcome of event feeling jittery was recovered on an unspecified date; while the outcome of other events was unknown. The patient confirmed he doesn&#39;t believe it to be life threatening. She doesn&#39;t know if this is a severe allergic reaction. She was reading on the side effects the COVID-19 vaccine can cause. Per reporter all events were related to suspect product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the contribution of suspect BNT162b2 to the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She screamed.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done. She also thought if she ever wanted to travel that she might need it. She thought in the long run she might benefit from having the vaccine. She felt peer pressured honestly to get it because she was sketched out to get it at all. She wants to know the rate of people testing positive for COVID after getting the vaccine. The outcome of the events sore arm, chest burning, joint and bone pain, skin even hurt to touch and sensitive was recovered on 15Jan2021, the outcome of the events screamed and couldn&#39;t walk was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovering.

                                                15 hours after injection I experienced severe joint pain all over my body. This continued until 32 hours post vaccine. Motrin and Tylenol helped but didn?t completely take all pain away. Injection arm was slightly sore. I was lethargic until 36 hours post vaccine. All symptoms subsided the next morning.

It was non painful at first, but now it is tender. It is roughly the size of an egg/golf ball. I also have tenderness on my chest  above my right breast but on the pectoralis muscle. Nothing in the right armpit. I also had aggressive itching at the injection site and a hard area and red welt.

Very weak - if that was a 10th of what COVID felt like, I didn&#39;t want it! Those symptoms lasted about three to five days. By the5th day - I was mostly back to myself. I took Motrin - which helped slightly for headache.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot I suddenly felt like I was having an anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and a tingling adrenaline feeling started in my head and spread down through my body.  My throat felt strange, but I could still breathe.  It started to subside after a couple of minutes but didn?t resolve completely for another hour or so.  I also had a headache almost immediately.  In the days following the vaccine I had such sore muscles it was hard to get out of chair or go upstairs.  That lasted 3 days.   About one week after the shot I started noticing my brain felt glitchy.  At night I have not slept well since about one week after the vaccination  and  I frequently awaken feeling confused, stressed, and disoriented.  This is not normal for me.    Additionally, about 3 weeks after the vaccine I had another mild panic attack.  I have not been troubled by panic attacks before getting the vaccine.  As of today I am starting to feel less glitchy in my thinking. I am still not sleeping soundly and waking often, sometimes accompanied with confusion.

This increased to chills, a temp of 101f (baseline 97.8), and myalgias/fatigue so severe Going to the restroom felt like running a marathon (which I have done). I had to fully lay down and couldn?t carry my 15lb son. I also had marked breast tenderness greater on the side of the injection. My son seemed to have trouble staying latched (?due to tiredness from my direct warmth), and had increased fussiness.  I have never had more than a mild local injection reaction w tenderness with any other vaccine

These spread to my upper extremities and became consistent. Occasionally will appear in lips and trunk. These are associated with sensation of numbness and some discomfort in my extremities. I&#39;m also experiencing significant brain fog, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Headaches are occurring about every other day.  Symptoms are present currently and have remained relatively consistent in severity.  Was evaluated by urgent care on December 28 and encouraged to observe. Was evaluated in the ER by neurology on January 4. There leading hypothesis is vaccine related immune response. Neurologic exam was largely normal, being evaluated by a specialist in the coming days.

At 0845, she came to me and reported that her shoulder was achy and the pain rated 4/10 was radiating to her back. I checked the injection site and arm and it was not red, raised, or warm. Pt did not have any other symptoms, just the achy shoulder. Pt also reported a brief burning sensation in her shoulder that subsided within 1 minute. She later felt that same sensation in her forearm and it also subsided. It was recommended that she go to the ED for monitoring since the pain was radiating further from her shoulder. ED RN took her in at 0905 and I left.

                                                At 2000 on 1/13/21, I started to experience intense ache at the injection site, which by 2200 progressed to myalgias in my back, especially lower back, neck, and right arm. At 2300,  I started to have fever/chills, up to 39 C orally. This only partially responded to Tylenol. I was not able to sleep.  At 2:30 am I noticed an unusual headache, 8/10, as well as bilateral eye pain on Moving eyes side to side as well as sensitivity to light. Headache was mostly frontal, which came and went every few minutes  until exactly 11:38 am on 1/14/2021, when the fever and myalgias very suddenly got significantly better. Almost exactly 24 hrs to the minute after injection. On 1/15/2021, I still have significant pain in my left arm, swelling, redness and, now, itching at the injection site. My lower back still hurts.

A 37-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The healthy female patient complained about a unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy (self-examined) on the left side (the same side as the 2nd vaccine shot on Friday 08Jan2021), yesterday evening (Sunday, 10Jan2021). It seemed to start developing within 24-48 hours after the shot, more noticeable at 72 hours with the pain (Jan2021) already improving. She also developed myalgia, headache and chills 12-18 (Jan2021) after the shot. All the other symptoms were somewhat anticipated, but the lymphadenopathy was not. She doesn&#39;t have any other conditions. The outcome of lymph node pain was recovering, while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about batch/ lot number cannot be obtained.

Following this, I experienced pain at the injection site until 1-12-21 when the pain spread to my left axilla. I also experienced notable swelling to the left axilla and numbness and tingling that radiates down my left arm and into my left pinky and ring fingers. My first dose was also administered to my left arm with only soreness at the injection site experienced. I have not previously experienced any reactions to vaccines in the past.

A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number: EL3249, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 13Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic fatigue syndrome from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no known allergies. Patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12), Iron, and Vitamin D (VITAMIN D NOS); patient received these medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 14Jan2021 04:00 AM, the patient experienced severe cramping, followed by episode of diarrhea. During the cramping, she lost consciousness for an unknown amount of time. No therapeutic measures were taken in response to the events. Outcome of the events at the time of last observation was recovering. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of lost consciousness cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 37-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot # EJ1685) at single dose at left arm on 02Jan2021 11:45 for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety. No allergies to medications, food, or other products. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient has received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 03Jan2021 the patient has been tested for COVID-19 with rapid nasal swab test resulted positive. It was unknown if treatment was received. The outcome of events was unknown. Later the patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot # EL0140) at single dose at left arm on 23Jan2021 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at Pharmacy or drug store. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications in 2 weeks of this vaccination included: Lamictal, Klonopin, multivitamins, D, C, B, Zinc. On 24Jan2021 12:00 AM the patient experienced extreme tiredness, chills, fever, muscle aches, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, pale skin, malaise, night sweats. No treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag. Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use. Further information like confirmative COVID 19 nucleic acid/ PCR test together with any associated symptoms are needed for full medical assessment.

                                                I felt weak and with muscle fatigue the day after the shot. Also had a headache and neck muscle tension and mid back muscle tension. Joint pains as well. These subsided after 48 hours except for the neck and upper back muscle fatigue and mild soreness. This gave me a low grade headaches almost daily since the vaccine. I took ibuprofen a few times which helped. On the 6th I awoke at night and felt weak all over. I felt like I was falling in my bed. Mild dizziness.  I went to work and felt extremely fatigued with muscle weakness but no neuro deficits. I feared some terrible autoimmune illness and took Decadron that day- 4mg tab BID. This helped my muscle weakness but left me with insomnia. The decadron is now wearing off after 4 days and I still have muscle weakness/fatigue. It takes considerable effort walking up the stairs. Yesterday my masseter muscles became fatigued with little chewing. My arms feel heavy when I lift them. The strange thing is that at night when I lie down I feel like my sympathetic nervous system is being triggered. I will get palpitations and feel just strange- I can&#39;t describe it.  I took valium to sleep last night -5 mg tablets that my doctor gave me Saturday as there seems to be an anxiety panic component going on. I have no history of diagnosed anxiety or panic attacks- I have never felt this way before. Today I feel a little better but still have considerable muscle fatigue and neck and upper back muscle soreness and overall muscle tightness in my arms and legs- feels good to stretch kind of feeling. I have mild dizziness when standing up and turning too abruptly. But no considerable focal neuro deficits.

                                                7 days after my first Pfizer COVID vaccine, I developed mastitis. It began in the morning with mild generalized muscle and joint pain and progressed to moderate to severe joint pain, a fever of 102 degrees, and localized redness and swelling of the left breast over the course of 12 hours. Treatment with Cephalexin 500 mg PO QID for 14 days was initiated within 12 hours of onset. The systemic symptoms resolved within 24 hours of treatment onset and the breast redness and swelling resolved within 72 hours.   While I am aware that an infectious mastitis is likely unrelated to the vaccine, I opted to report this incident because I have breastfed 3 children and have never had mastitis prior to this event  and because of the limited information available on this vaccine in lactating women.

I had a temperature of 99.1. I went to an urgent care and my BP was elevated (very unusual for me) 140/100 and HR 110 and temp still 99.1.  They did a rapid swab on me that was negative. I continued to feel awful the rest of the day. On Sunday the next morning I awoke because I had a very swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit. I took tylenol and did warm compresses. I had continued fatigue on Sunday and slept the whole day. I also continued with a high heart rate 110-130 with activity. My Bp was 117/70I had a pulse oximeter at home. My temp stayed 99.  Monday morning I woke up feeling better. My HR was in the 80 and temp 98.3 and fatigue is gone. I still have mild soreness in my left arm but the redness is fine and warmth is gone. My left armpit is still sore

I was diagnosed with pleurisy by my MD ~6 weeks after the original illness, and it slowly resolved over time. This current chest pain is similar. It is not limiting my activity, but is a little annoying.

I called my primary care physician to see if there was anything I could take to help, they advised me to take Ibuprofen and Tylenol. I started to feel better a few hours after taking Ibuprofen.  The next day I just had a headache and am feeling tired.  I would say the most extreme symptoms lasted about 10 hours and started to slowly feel better after that.

By 0600 I was feeling better- more relaxed. Muscle aches and sore joints are still present today. Also have a slight increase in temp 99.6 and injection site pain.

Palpable lymph node along left clavicle with similar fluid filled swelling. Took motrin throughout the day and 50 mg of benadryl at bedtime. 1/13: Left arm pit still swollen. more tender with movement. While at work i put hot compress in my arm pit to help with the pain and shortly after i noticed my left arm had bright red streaks from my arm pit to my wrist. It also was very mottled looking. My arm felt tight/heavy  or kind of like a pinched nerve feeling.. I took motrin throughout the day for soreness and took benadryl at bedtime. I place ice pack under my arm during the evening as well.  1/14: Swelling remains in the armpit. Tenderness is getting better. Similar swelling around clavicle . Still taking motrin for inflammation and using ice pack under my arm.

                                                Approximately 28 hours after injection I started experiencing intermittent numbness and tingling in the right hand. At 33 hours post injection developed a deep dull aching pain throughout entire right arm. This worsened, and after 2 more hours intermittent sharp shooting pain down the arm. Pain rated 6 out of 10 intermittently with a constant 3 out of 10 full ache.  Difficulty falling asleep due to discomfort and at one point the pain woke me up from sleep. It was resolving by early the next morning, and disappeared by hour 48 post injection. These pains were not inclusive of the soreness and tenderness of the injection site or the muscle pain when lifting the arm. Those symptoms are still present to a minimal extent 54 hours after injection, at the time I am writing this report.

                                                When I got up at 0530 yesterday (1/19) my right arm was so sore I couldn&#39;t lift it. I got to work at 0700 and felt really drained and tired. I fell asleep without realizing it at some point and a coworker saw me and woke me up at 0930. I attended a lecture at 1000 and started feeling chills, aches, and was sweating. I tried to take notes but couldn&#39;t remember how to spell a lot of basic words and couldn&#39;t get my brain to focus.  My boss sent me home at 1145. I was driving home and when I got off the interstate I couldn&#39;t remember which way to turn at the light off the exit. I had to pull up a navigation app on my phone to remember how to get home.  When I got home I took my temperature and it was 98.5F. I slept for 3 hours, picked my kids up from school, and then slept for another 2 hours. I took my temperature at 1900 and it was 98.5F still. My chills and aches had lessened but not disappeared by the time I went to bed at 2100, but by the time my alarm went off at 0530 this morning I felt completely back to normal.

Friday I became dizzy, and had 2 near fainting spells (this included dizziness, weak muscles, and slight loss of sight). I became achy (back and shoulders) and my headache continued.  These dizzy spells and headaches have continued for 6 days.  The dizziness is starting to subside, however the headache and fatigue remains.

A 38-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 14Jan2021 15:30 to 14Jan2021 15:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing pernicious anaemia, a B12 deficiency diagnosed 2-3 years ago (she gave herself B12 shots and she cannot convert B12 through her food), and myomectomy (15 cm uterine fibroid, removed this past summer). Concomitant medication included ongoing cyanocobalamin (B12) for pernicious anemia. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 28Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and a flu shot (the MA gave it in the back of her arm, it was pretty significant). The patient was a nurse and informed that she received the second COVID vaccine the day before report (14Jan2021). She woke up on the day of report on 15Jan2021 03:00 with a nasty headache, she felt hot, had the creepy crawly shivers, was achy and when she talked, she felt like she had to close her eyes because of pressure, and she was nauseous. She figured this was probably normal but she couldn&#39;t get a hold of her doctor and the hospital she worked at did not know what to tell her. She was wondering if she can take Tylenol or ibuprofen and has even thought about drinking caffeine, that it might help her headache. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor as she got it at work. The first round of the vaccine she only had a super mild sore arm and a slight headache. She received the second vaccine at 3:30pm and then went to bed when she got home. She woke herself up at 3 am because her arm was hurting really bad. She started feeling like she couldn&#39;t keep her legs still. She felt hot, achy, and was shivering. She hasn&#39;t taken her temperature. When she woke up at 3 am she got on her phone, and her eyesight felt like she couldn&#39;t quite focus. It wasn&#39;t bad, but she felt like she was straining. Then her head started hurting at 5-7 am. She was very sensitive to light. She woke up and couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She had cold sweats, and was shivering. Every time she stood up, she was chattering. She felt achy almost like growing pains. She woke up with the arm pain, and then 10-15 minutes later, she started feeling that creepy crawly feeling. She got up and the cool fan hit her, and she realized how bad she was shivering. The shivering intensified at times but hasn&#39;t gotten worse. She had just called employee health and realized that when her eyes were open when she was talking was when she felt nauseated. She has noticed the nausea in the past half hour. She did not know if it was related to the headache or what. She had to cover her eyes, her eyeballs felt sore. When she talked with her eyes open, she felt a little queasy. She was just straining to see. Her vision was not blurry but she can tell she was straining. She did not know if it was because of the headache and nausea. When she got out of bed, the cold fan did not feel cold but it made her shiver. She was a nurse was trying to be socially responsible as she did not want to get COVID. She was a little suspicious because of the headache after the first one. She hasn&#39;t been around anyone in a couple of weeks and had been working from home. She has not been exposed to people. She kept feeling like she needed to stretch because she was sore. The patient was tested for COVID pre-surgery (myomectomy) and was negative. She was also tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any. She was vaccinated at a hospital facility. Patient received no other vaccines on that day. The adverse events did not require any visit to the emergency room or physician office. Patient did not receive prior vaccines in the previous 4 weeks. Outcome of the events cold sweat and &#34;tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any&#34; was unknown, nasty headache was reported as worsened (not recovered), and the remaining events was not recovered. The reporter considered the events serious due to medically significant events and related to the suspect drug.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine in the development of the events cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                tunnel vision; Muscle fatigue; joint pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP) communicated to a Pfizer colleague. A 38-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received her first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on right arm on 04Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was None.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  On 04Jan2021 the patient experienced tunnel vision, muscle fatigue, joint pain. No treatment was received for the events.  The outcome of the events was not resolved.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of tunnel vision cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I started to have a very mild headache. It felt like a pressure headache. I took Motrin. About 6 hours later that was gone. That night, about 8 hours after vaccine, I began to have muscle aches - whole body. I was very sore. I went to bed. Next day, I had severe joint and muscle aches and pains. The Motrin did not help that. Ice did not help, heat did not help and rest did not help. No headache. I wasn&#39;t red in face etc. Over the next week, I the muscle aches and joint aches were varying between moderate to severe. Some days it did restrict my activity completely. It started to get better week two - but still moderate to severe. I had some abdominal pain on upper left side and my right side (upper, as well) The upper right side pain would go away with ice but the upper left side wasn&#39;t helped with that. The only thing in those two weeks that helped was Celebrex (Motrin stopped helping). After two weeks - around 2/5/2021, I saw my Dr - a virtual visit. He told me to double up on the dose of Celebrex to help with muscle aches, joint aches and right side abdominal pain. Heart palpitations - irregular heartbeat. On 2/7/2021, I took a test for COVID and it was negative.  The joint and muscle aches were moderate to mild the third week. There was no more abdominal pain in third week. Week 4 - mild joint and muscle aches - only a few days that week and that was it. Last week was the first week where I had a few days that were fine. And this week, I have been completely fine. Had general malaise for three weeks solid. And now it&#39;s gone.

I took a dose of oral Benadryl it didn&#39;t go away. It felt like a sunburn.  I had a headache starting at the back of my head. 1st and second day, I had pain in my joints. Not muscular pain. It came and went the joint pain - behind my left knee was hurting really bad and then it went away. Then my right wrist would start hurting and then it would go away, etc. The second day, the headache was more mild - like a mild pressure in my head. The redness was still there - the red face and red arms. My left arm at the site was cherry red and about the size of two inch circle and somewhat raised. The third day, my headache was worse. It was not like a normal headache but an overall pressure in head. Pink and a bit larger but didn&#39;t  hurt as  bad on arm- the redness continued for six days on my face. The headache lasted 14 days straight - Motrin, ice, heat and extra sleep was tried for treatment. On 15th day it started to let up. On 16th day, it was very mild headache. On the 17th day, it was a full blown headache again. Day 18 it was gone. On the second week, I had mild pain in my stomach and then that went away. On day 3, I had about an hour - twice that day - where I was short of breath and then it went away - it was just that day - about noon and at night. I took Benadryl and when I woke up that didn&#39;t  happen again. Doctor called on day 12 - when my headaches weren&#39;t going away. He took some labs. My labs were normal except thyroid (and I already have a condition for my thyroid). Dr. gave me a medication for headache but I didn&#39;t take it - it had a possibility of making me tired and I didn&#39;t want to take it.

Still dry next morning and a couple hrs later it switched to increased salivation.  The evening after injection I had a headache and  just felt general malaise and fatigue, &#34;run down&#34;. Difficulty sleeping that night due to body aches. HEadache, neck and lower back pain. Skin sensitivity when touched, bed sheets kinda hurt my skin. The bodyaches and malaise persisted through out day 2. Tylenol seemed to help.  I slept better that night but woke up with night sweats, completely drenched.  Arm pain at injection site on day 2 that resolved by mid day.  Now 1 week later I have extreme fatigue yesterday and today. I do have hypersomnia but not even my adderall is helping. Not sure if this is related or not.

Thirty hours post vaccination, she had pain and swelling and could barely move. Dr. needed to take valium and Celebrex though for those 48 hours, and would have gone to the ER if they had not helped (the pain was that debilitating)

                                                I received the COVID vaccine on Monday Dec. 21, 2020 at 14:30.  By 17:00 I was not feeling well.  I was tired, had a headache, muscle aches, nausea and a fever of 101 F.   The headache, low grade fever and significant malaise continued through Tues Dec 22 and Wed Dec 23.   On Thursday morning Dec 24 at 2:30 AM, I woke from sleep with the urge to use the bathroom.   I suddenly felt light-headed and dizzy and had a diaphoresis that soaked my hair and PJs.   Fortunately my husband who is a nurse anesthetist helped me through the episode safely and was able to get me back to bed.   I am not sure if that event was related to the vaccine or if I happened to be a little dehydrated and had a vaso-vagal event.  I did not take any medications because I was allowing my body to have a natural response to the vaccine.

Pain is in anterior shoulder and radiates down right arm. Pain is constant but worse with movement. Pain started the night that vaccine was given 1/2/2021 and has been persistent since then making it difficult to work. Pain not relieved with tylenol or ibuprofen. Pain is more severe that what would be expected from needle trauma. Of note, vaccine was given particularly high near subdeltoid bursa.

A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (COVID-19 vaccine) lot no: EL0140, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 18Dec2020 15:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux and known allergies to PCN, both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient was not pregnant at the time of report. Concomitant medication included omeprazole (PROTONIX), ibuprofen (MOTRIN). No other vaccines were administered in four weeks. On 19Dec2020 at 14:30, the patient experienced fever 102.9 &#34;normal for vaccines i know&#34;, tingling in lower legs neuropathy like, severe cramping in hands and feet, and severe bone pain. The patient recovered from the events in Dec2020. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient didn&#39;t have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of bnt162b2 and the onset of neuropathy like cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL3246/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX). The patient experienced arm pain and headache 4 hours post injection requiring Excedrin. At bedtime, neck stiffness began and worsened. She was treated with lidocaine patches and Aleve. She developed diarrhea 33 hours post injection. She went ER because she was dehydrated. She developed UTI very quickly by hour 35 post injection. She had puffy face and eyes, and burning inside her digestive tract. She was treated with Benedryl at home for allergic reaction, Toradol for pain, IV fluids for dehydration and Keflex for infection. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dehydration cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

Called PCP on the 15th as symptoms were getting worse not better. Patient advised me to go to ED. Went to ED here last Friday and was released. The weakness in legs got much worse and early the following week she started getting the numbness and weakness in arms. She went for the follow up post ED visit with NP at PCP office on 1/20 and due to the continued weakness, after consulting with one of the MDs, decision was made to send her back to ED for further work up to check for GBS including the LP in ED, labs and MRI of head, spine, lumbar and thoracic. Patient was release on Saturday 1/23 and diagnosis was a severe immune response to the vaccine.  Patient still has unsteady gait and weakness.

My boss came to help walk me outside because I didn?t even feel like it was me walking. I don?t remember walking out of work.  I was there but ?not there?. I was not myself. I didn?t feel like i was in my body. I had to have my husband come get me from work, I slept most the rest of the day and night. Now I?m on day 2 and my joints still ache, my head hurts so bad, I am so tired I either am asleep on the couch or in bed. I have no energy. It takes everything I have to move just to go to the bathroom.

                                                10 hrs after I received 1st dose of Pfizer I started feeling my heart beating rapidly and hard.  I was short of breath and had nausea and a headache.  This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

In Sunday through the following Wednesday, joint pain continued to worsen and settle in additional joints including first 2 metacarpal bones of both hands almost like arthritic pain. Fingers and joints red and swollen. Pain and swelling next settled in toes of both feet, right side elbow, shoulder and knee. On Monday following vaccine I called employee health and they advised me to come and take covid test. I described symptoms and was told they were side effects of the vaccine and to follow up with a doctor if it continues.  My covid test was negative. On the following Thursday I went to urgent care and described my persisting symptoms.  I was prescribed a methylprednisolone pack and hydroxyzine. I was told to use naproxen as needed. Yesterday  the urgent care sent a check up message. I am still experiencing joint pain although the intensity has decreased but it is still significant pain that is disabling my grip and strengrh overall. The joint pain is mostly just in my upper extremities, hands, fingers  and shoulders now consistently. The np prescribed a 10 day pack of meloxicam to try and help minimize the pain.

Then on 2/14/2021 I started feeling burning  pain all over my neck and chest. It was slightly red that night. The next morning my chest, neck, and upper back had a red rash . My chest was the worst of it. Felt like a chemical burn . I went to the Doctor on 2/17/2021 and was told it was a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine. I continued to take Benadryl, Zyrtec  and was given Kenalog. On Sunday 2/21/2021 the pain was so pain and the rash was only getting worse and now on my face so I went to urgent care. There I was given a steroid ( prednisone) , derma smoothe and Pepcid. It has been 10 days and no improvement yet.

A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number and Expiration date was unknown), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date, second dose via intramuscularly in right arm on 16Jan2021 15:30; both at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in workplace clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history included depression, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), latex allergy. Concomitant medications included venlafaxine, L-methylfolate; the patient received both the drugs within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took fluoxetine, citalopram and experienced known allergies for both the drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient experienced debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension on 25Jan2021 06:00. On 01Feb2021, the patient underwent lab test and procedure included nasal swab/ COVID-19 by PCR: Negative. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with IV Dexamethazone, Diphenhydramine, ketorolac, promethazine for all the events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: On the basis of the available information, the reported events debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension would seem most likely related to intercurrent and/or underlying medical condition and concomitant medication, which is not related to bnt162b2.
