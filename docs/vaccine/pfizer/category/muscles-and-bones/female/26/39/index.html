                                                On 01/07/2021 I woke up  at 0300am with chills, headache, body aches, joint pain, fever of 101.2 and swollen left axillary lymph nodes. I took Tylenol and Benadryl and it relieved the fever/headache/body aches/joint pain, however the lymph nodes in my left axillary remained swollen. I continue to take Tylenol for the fever/body aches/pains without relief for the swollen and painful axillary lymph nodes. Warm  compresses do help to relieve the pain temporarily but they remain painfully swollen. On 01/08/21 I called my doctors office to ask if it was normal to experience such painfully swollen axillary lymph nodes to which they stated ?we don?t know, it is too soon for us to tell what?s normal and what isn?t normal right now.? They did not offer any suggestions to relieve the pain or swelling. The morning of 01/09/2021 , I called Employee Health at my hospital (my place of work and also where I received the vaccine) and they also stated they didn?t know if this was a normal reaction due to the newness of the vaccine. A couple hours later, employee health emailed me a link to the VAERS reporting website and asked me to file a report.

Described as a nerve and muscle ache/throb, or &#34;growing pains&#34;/RLS symptoms. Put on compression socks which helped, but still too uncomfortable to sleep. Was able to sleep after taking ibuprofen 800mg and drinking water. 6 hours after the ibuprofen was administered, pain returned in lower legs as well as neck/ears  with body temperature swings (cold, teeth chattering to sweating uncontrollably in a few minutes). After 1 hour of trying to sleep but failing, put compression socks back on. Temperature rose to 100-100.2 F, chills causing whole body to shake under multiple blankets. Tingling/muscle pains extremely uncomfortable and unable to rest, took another ibuprofen 800mg and water and was able to sleep. Tingling and muscle pains have continued as soon as ibuprofen wears off and come back more intense each time, most notably in the lower legs and near ears/neck and elbow of arm administered in (similar to &#34;tennis elbow,&#34; assumed to be provoked by inflammation, happened with first dose).

This persisted throughout the night and I did not sleep. Took 1000 mg of Acetaminophen at 5:30 and slept until 7 AM. By 8 AM, my temperature was back down to 98 F. Took 500 mg of Acetaminophen at 10 AM with food. Headache, muscle pain, and joint pain persisted. Moderate to severe chest pain began 15 mins after eating at 4 PM. Waited 30 mins to see if it resolved; it did not. Went to the urgent care. Chest x-ray and EKG was performed, no issues found. Was diagnosed with costochondritis and was given a steroid shot and ibuprofen,  which reduced the pain significantly within 30 mins later.

A 26-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ 1686, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 08Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ 1685, unknown expiration) via intramuscular in right arm on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as needed and unspecified birth control. The patient has no known allergies.

The patient also experienced significant body aches, especially pronounced in lower back region occurred. Headache also present at this time (09Jan2021). She began having sweats and possible fever (didn&#39;t have thermometer to accurately verify this though). The patient&#39;s average HR is usually 70s. For about 36 hours (09Jan2021), it ran 100-130s. Vomiting episodes continued and for all of 09Jan2021, the patient did absolutely nothing. The patient described her body ached like it had been beaten by a baseball bat. On 10Jan2021, her HR at rest back in 70s, but with minimal exertion, will go to 110-120s. She had to call out of work from 11Jan2021 and 12Jan2021 due to continued nausea, dehydration and excessive fatigue. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient&#39;s symptoms still persisting at the time she is reporting this event. The patient did not receive treatment for the events.

As far as what happened, I received my 2nd dose of Pfizer on Jan. 13th @ 05:15 at hospital and started feeling symptoms roughly six hours later, symptoms being nausea, chills, splitting headaches, muscle fatigue, feeling tired and joint pain. I had understood that these side effects were common and not to worry, however, the next day on Jan. 14th around 11:00am, I blacked out at home. Luckily, my partner had caught me before I feel to the ground, but he stated that my eyes had glazed over, my breathing was shallow, and I hardly had a pulse. He was getting ready to do chest compressions, but I had come out of whatever fog that had knocked me down and became responsive. Around 12:00 pm I had arrived at the ED where they had given me a bag on NS, Zofran for the nausea and Toradol for some inflammation management. I believe I discharged from the ED around 15:20.

                                                The vaccine was inadequately administered, too deep and too high, into the shoulder bursa. The patient developed sharp pain soon after which persisted for two days. Soon after she started with neurological symptoms including increased sweating in the affected arm, pain in the branchial plexus region, including arm and forearm, paresthesias in arm, forearm, and fingers, sensation of scapula being dislocated, and tightening sensation in the lateral aspect of the chest. Symptoms are worsening every day. There is a high suspicion that she is developing Parsonage-Turner syndrome.

Reports the rest of the day felt tachycardiac for a few hours (HR 120-140) and dizzy. Started getting muscle aches/joint aches. Denies any recent COVID exposure. Tested positive for COVID In 8/2020. Reports hips/knees are throbbing today; Heart rate WNL.   ///    Presenting today due to intermittent presyncope and palpitations. Also notes generalized weakness. Patient evaluate 2 L of fluid given her Mirena IUD D-dimer was sent which was negative patient with no pleuritic symptoms or dyspnea to suggest pulmonary embolism. Otherwise hemodynamically stable on exam ambulates with no difficulty no focal neurologic deficits. Patient did describe on her initial presentation that she noted some weakness of her bilateral legs. Given her possible viral reaction and description of weakness it is possible the patient is developing an early autoimmune reaction however she has no evidence of GuillainBarré or transverse myelitis on my exam. We will plan to discharge with neurology follow-up as outpatient.

                                                Beginning January 2nd, 11 days after my covid vaccine I developed right sided back pain. Two days later I had an area of papules on my anterior thigh the size of a half dollar. The right sided back pain then began to radiate around to my hip and the rash began to be painful. My right thigh eventually began to tingle and and the pain increased in severity. On Jan 7th I presented to the acute care clinic at the Clinic and was diagnosed with shingles.

About 24 hours after the 2nd dose, I noticed the area around my left collar bone was swollen . The area is painful to touch and contains a lump about the size of a dime.  Pain is experienced when I attempt to cross my left arm over my body. Lump and pain still remains 51 hours after vaccination.

                                                Got 1st shot at 1430 1/4/21. Was sent back to my unit (OR). At 1455 got full body flush followed by tingling lips, tight throat, trouble swallowing and SOB. No obvious signs of swelling of the lips. Used inhaler for SOB which helped marginally. After 1.5 hrs tingling in lips and flushed skin went away. Throat tightness and SOB still remained but weren&#39;t progressing so went home after my shift. Later that night around 2100 took 1 25mg  Benadryl. Tightness in throat and SOB improved. The next morning 1/5/21, I reported to work for my shift. Tightness and SOB was manageable at this point. At 0800 the tightness in my throat, trouble swallowing and SOB got significantly worse. I was scrubbed into a surgery and had to call for a replacement so I could take Benadryl. I took 1 25mg tablet and 2 puffs of my inhaler and went back to my case. After the Benadryl and inhaler, the tightness in my throat and SOB became slightly more manageable. At 1240 the symptoms came back and I took another Benadryl and 2 puffs of my inhaler with slight relief of symptoms. Stayed the rest of my shift continuing my inhaler as needed and a Benadryl every 4 hrs. At 1600 I developed a headache at the front of my head above my eyes like a weight was sitting there. The next day when I woke up 1/6/21, the tightness in my throat, SOB and headache were worse so I had to call into work. The headache that morning had progressed to 7 out of 10 pain and the pain then included my neck where it attaches to the skull. At 0830 I called employee health and they advised my to go to an urgent care. I was checked over by a PA and was prescribed prednisone 40 mg for 5 days along with Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler as needed. I was also nasal swabbed for Covid. After taking the steroid, the headache and neck pain, tightness in throat went away. The SOB also improved. Currently taking the steroid, Benadryl (every 4 hrs) and inhaler 2 puffs as needed. Symptoms are mostly controlled. 1/7/21 tried to cut back the Benadryl to every 6 hrs. Noticed a huge difference in my breathing and had an increase in SOB so went back to every 4 hrs. 1/8/21 still taking steroid and Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler. SOB is worse today even with taking Benadryl. Have an appointment with my PCP to talk about getting the 2nd shot.

Seems like a swollen lymph node. Today (2 days later), the area is more tender and a little larger upon palpation.

Finally fell asleep and woke up at 8am very sore but much better. Around 3:30pm I started again with the same severe chills, fever, body aches and now nausea. Woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat.  The following morning I woke up around 8am again with horrible mid/lower bilateral back pain.  This lasted till about 1pm. It?s not 9pm and all symptoms have subsided. I feel hopeful, thanks for all you do!

                                                Fine for ~6-9 hours post injection. But then immediate fever (103F), body ache, extreme joint pain and a feeling of something eating away in my bones, chills, bruised/swollen/pain in left arm (injection spot), fever, fatigue, headache, light cough for 5 straight days. Not able to do normal activities. Took Tylenol and ice pack to alleviate fever. The day after injection, body fell so weak that my body acquired another viral infection (very unusual). No shortness of breath. Eating/drinking/appetite fine. No loss of taste/smell.  I am exactly 1 week from the injection. No fever, just light headache. Able to resume normal activities but gets fatigued fairly quickly (after 3 hours). I am very active and work out 2 hours every day, but may not be able to do strenuous activity/exercise for some time...  I was symptomatic covid last year in April 2019. This was very similar experience but an extremely debilitating, more intense version of the covid that I had.  ***I am unsure if I should proceed with the second dose due to a very severe reaction to the first dose***

I felt really dizzy and nauseated, I felt like I could not walk. I felt like I hit by a bus. The next day I had heavy flu symptoms, high fever, continuous chest pain and high HR, at the ER they gave me a high dose of Benadryl, steroids and fluids. I took Benadryl for about 7 days and I still felt light headed palpitations and fever for almost 2 weeks. I also was tested for COVID and it was negative. I was advised to not take the second vaccine. I still have a really bad fatigue. It is the symptom that is still on and off.

                                                When I went to get the shot, I had a  firm bump with what looked like a white head on my left arm from the first shot. When she injected the 2nd dose, the bump was painful and grew twice in size on my arm and started bleeding. The technician rubbed the area for a fews minutes and the swelling went down. The bump went down, but the whole day, I felt a little sick. At around 7pm, I felt feverish, with muscle aches and chills. My skin was sensitive to touch, I felt nauseous, and I could barely walk. The bottom of my left eyelid also became a little swollen. The symptoms resolved the next morning.

                                                First started off with a cold feeling around injection site. Around 11:30 at night I felt muscle aches in my calves. 30 minutes later my legs were having severe muscle aches and joint pain in my ankles. I was having cold chills and aches the whole night along with sweating. On 1/20/2021 (the next day) the muscle aches, chills, and joint pain continued through the whole day. I was nauseous at times and did not have an appetite. Around 5 o clock I felt some relief with my leg pain but it started again around 9 o clock. I continued switching Tylenol extra strength and ibuprofen. I went to bed on 1/20 at midnight with little leg pain but major neck and back aches. I did not have cold chills through the night or sweating. Today (1/21/2021) leg pain is near gone, but joint pain is still there in my left ankle and knee. My legs feel heavy and strange and is causing me to walk slowly because I feel like my legs are very fatigued and off balance. I have had neck and back aches all day. I have not had chills today

                                                I was asymptomatic for about 6.5 hours after the vaccine was given. At about 6pm on the day I received the vaccine I noticed some injection site tenderness, minimal swelling; has been present since. Symptoms are very mild. I started having chills and hot flashes intermittently, more hot flashes than chills, have been present since 6pm yesterday. About 9pm I had a headache, muscle aches, joint pain as well. I felt feverish but temperature was 98.6F. I also noticed some axial lymph node swelling as well on the Left side where I received the vaccine. Tender to touch, not too painful though. Since received the vaccine I have had intermittent dizzy spells as well all throughout the day.  I decided to go to sleep at 10:30pm and all night I tossed and turned with a headache and hot flashes. I woke up at 7:30am and was so stiff I could barely get out of bed. I called into work as I could not stand up without have dizziness. All day so far I have had dizziness upon standing, headache, myalgia, arthralgias, hot flashes/felt feverish, swollen axial lymph nodes and all I have wanted to do today is sleep. I took a nap and when I woke up I had been sleeping for 6 hours. I finally was able to get up and drink a 32ounce cup of water and take some ibuprofen. Ate some cereal. I still have a headache and dizziness upon standing that limit my ability to do normal daily functions.

A 27-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL8982, expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 07:30 AM at 0.3 mL, single (0.3 mL of the undiluted vaccine) on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization (reported as &#34;frontline worker&#34;).

Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (LO LOESTRIN FE). Vaccine facility type is hospital. No other vaccine in 4 weeks. The patient reported &#34;Miss dosed, I reportedly received 0.3 mL of the UNDILUTED vaccine&#34;, she given an undiluted dose of 0.3 on 20Jan2021. The patient had been experiencing some expected symptoms such as fevers, chills, myalgias, fatigue, headache. No treatment was received for the events. It was further reported that one of the nurses gave an undiluted dose of Pfizer 0.3 to an employee (patient). He has filled out the VAERS. The patient was fine. She has experienced normal post vaccination symptoms. She has had chills, body aches on 21Jan2021 and was feverish in Jan2021. They asked &#34;what to do from here? Does she need the second dose?&#34; Patient was told to take Advil, hydrate and rest. The reporter also asked &#34;Have their been any other issues like this? Has this happened before?&#34;. Patient did not have a prescribing doctor. It was just an employee vaccination. The nurse who administered it, thought it was already diluted. It was a fresh vial just opened and undiluted, but she thought it was just the last dose in a vial. So she drew up 0.3. It was a miscommunication. Patient got the vaccine at 7:30 am yesterday (20Jan2021). They found this out later because the inventory did not add up. There was an extra vial, but less people were vaccinated. The nurse thought it was diluted already. They called the patient late in the afternoon yesterday around 5:30 or 6 o&#39;clock. She said she was fine. Then, this morning she relayed to her supervisor that she was experiencing normal vaccination side effects. He was looking for more information before he called her again today to check on her. The patient is was a Physician assistant, so she was aware of what to do. She was told yesterday to take NSAID or Ibuprofen. The reporter does not know the seriousness of the events until he gets more information. He does feel like the side effects she was having were normal. Compared to what others have reported. Patient is a front line health care worker. She did work in the ICU during the beginning of the pandemic. She has no listed allergies. She was fully vaccinated because she was a healthcare worker. She has her HepB and MMR vaccines. Outcome of the events chills, body aches and feverish was not recovered (reported as ongoing), for &#34;Miss dosed, I reportedly received 0.3 mL of the UNDILUTED vaccine&#34; was unknown while for other events was recovering. Patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021064350 Pfizer

                                                I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 9:15 am on 2/23/21. Initially, my only symptoms were injection site soreness and minor swelling. Gradually throughout the day, my entire left arm become more and more sore. By 5:00pm, I felt exhausted and dizzy and was having chills. My temperature was 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. I took a dose of Extra Strength Tylenol, but felt no change. My joints and muscles began to ache around 6:00pm on 2/23/21 and did not stop aching until around 9:00pm on 2/24/21. During the evening of 2/23/21, my dizziness increased and I felt as if I would pass out any time I sat up or stood. My temperature had returned to 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit by 10:00pm on 2/23/21. I then took a dose of Motrin to help with my soreness. On 2/24/21 from morning until 8:30pm, I had no fever or chills, but still felt exhausted and had minor muscle/joint achiness. I took 3 doses of Motrin on 2/24/21 to help with the soreness. Throughout the day, I had some difficulty breathing (felt like a mild asthma attack) and used my emergency inhaler once. At 8:30pm on 2/24/21, my temperature was 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit. I took another dose of Motrin and went to sleep. Around 3:00am on 2/25/21, I woke up drenched in sweat, but feeling better. My temperature was normal then. When I woke up at 7:00am on 2/25/21, I no longer felt achy, dizzy, or tired. I still feel (now at 1:30pm on 2/25/21)as though my asthma is aggravated, but am not having difficulty breathing.

A 27-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 27-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Bell&#39;s Palsy (motor nerves involved) from 2017 to 2017. Concomitant medications included unspecified birth control. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced Bell&#39;s Palsy, severe muscle pain, itching in the left arm, rash in the left arm, cold sensation, like it was freezing, and severe allergic reaction on an unspecified date. It was reported that the Bell&#39;s Palsy lasted 8 days and was considered a modified Bell&#39;s Palsy because it only sensorial nerves were involved. It was reported that the patient did not receive any treatment for Bell&#39;s Palsy. The clinical outcome of Bell&#39;s Palsy, severe muscle pain, itching in the left arm, rash in the left arm, cold sensation, like it was freezing, and severe allergic reaction was recovered on an unspecified date.

At 1815 I developed blurred vision. The dizziness and blurred vision prevented me from standing. I was able to walk with assistance at 1915. The blurred vision lasted until 1915. The dizziness lasted until 2230.  At 2000 I had muscle aches and joint pain and could not get comfortable. Muscle aches and joint pain lasted until 1-1-21 at 1930. I did not seek medical treatment. (I working in the ER and did not feel it was severe enough to check in because the shortness of breath was mild and went away shortly after the dizziness began at 1815). I took Benadryl 50 mg at 1930 and 1000mg of Tylenol.

The muscle aches lasted about 24 hours. The injection site was my left arm and I now have swelling in my left axilla which started the evening of 1/6/21 and is still currently swollen. I am an ultrasound technologist and was able to scan myself this morning when I came back to work. It appears I have a cluster of reactive lymph nodes in the area of swelling within my left axilla, the largest measuring 3.0 cm. It is very tender in the area of swelling and the pain radiates down my left arm. I had a lot of pain at the injection site that lasted for about 24 hours, it is now subsiding. However, for the last 24 hours it has been very painful to bend my arm. Any time I tried to bend my arm it sent a throbbing pain down to my left hand, it is still occurring today.

A 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EJ1685), intramuscularly in the left arm on 17Dec2020 at 11:00 (at the age of 28-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included famotidine and fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA), both for unknown indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously took and had an allergy to amoxicillin. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 23Dec2020 at 13:00, the patient developed pain in her left axilla (6 days after vaccination). The patient was able to palpate a swollen lymph node in her left axilla. It continued to become more painful requiring ibuprofen and hot compresses. By 31Dec2020, her symptoms had largely resolved. She saw her physician who also felt the lymphadenopathy and had no other explanation than possible vaccine side effect. The clinical outcome of pain in her left axilla, swollen lymph node in her left axilla/lymphadenopathy, able to palpate a swollen lymph node in her left axilla was recovered on 31Dec2020. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after the vaccine administration, I started getting symptoms that started mild and became severe including: headache, dry cough with chest pressure, dizziness/lightheaded,  joint pain, body aches, fatigue, and chills. At 5:30 pm I started getting a fever, that started at 100.5 then increased to 103.3 by 8:30 pm. I was also nauseous and vomited once.  I was tested the next morning for influenza and COVID and was negative. My fever came back down to 98.8 around 12 pm the next day. Overall, symptoms lasted approximately 30 hours after the vaccine was administered.  I was out of work the following day after the vaccine. Now, 2 days after the vaccine I am just mildly fatigued with a dry cough left.

Called off work from my job as a flight nurse at midnight. Tried to sleep it off until about 0430 when the body aches became unbearable. Ate a few bites of yogurt and took 400mg of ibuprofen. No change in symptoms until 0530 when I took a hot shower which helped relieve some muscle pain. Took 400mg ibuprofen again at 1030 with a small snack with no change in pain or fevers. Took hot shower again which helped briefly. Nausea subsided around 1630, enough that I had a small meal of bland food and another 400mg of ibuprofen. By 1700 more tolerable myalgias and fever came down some. 2230 another 400mg dose of ibuprofen, fitful night of sleep waking again at 4am with shooting lower back pain and fever. Took another dose of 400mg ibuprofen and a hot shower. Woke up at 1000am sweaty with mild myalgias and low grade fever. Took another dose of ibuprofen 400mg, 30 minutes later profusely sweaty but afebrile. Fatigued all day and poor appetite until late evening. Woke up next day after better night of sleep at 0730. Mild fatigue and bad heartburn all day and night. Left arm still sore to touch. This morning (1/11) feeling mild heartburn but better.

Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the COVID Vaccine and the day after, was exposed to the virus, got sick right away and tested positive for the virus. The patient stated that she got vaccinated around 4pm, 17Dec2020. She was exposed to the virus by the same coworker twice on 18Dec2020 and then the next week, she believed, on 22Dec2020, the coworker tested positive for COVID.

My chills became violent and coarse rigors, severe enough to contract the spine into hyperextension if I kept my body in a neutral position. I could still activate each muscle group to keep in a fetal prostration pose. I was knowledgeable of the event, did not loose any bowel, bladder, or smooth muscle function, and the intensity of the rigors was focused on the most developed skeletal muscles (thighs, calves, upper arms, forearms, paraspinal muscles, hands, respectively).  Jaw and muscles of the head/face seemed unaffected. Fingers and toes not distinctly affected. I was not sweating at this time and there were NO other symptoms to report; I remained lucid and able to self-reflect the entire time. Home temperature is kept to consistent 66F, no malfunctions to thermostat. No recent changes to bedding (sheet and quit on top of mattress); it is even optimized for me as I tend to overheat as I sleep.   At 50 minutes, I felt &#34;less frozen&#34; and confident enough to stand/ambulate for 220mg naproxen &#43; 500mg APAP , cautiously and successfully swallowed. Robe was donned over existing pajamas and thick comforter was pulled from hallway closet. Rigors continued, but it appeared that intentional activation of the muscle groups could still overpower the rigors for safe (but shaky) ambulation. Greatest risk was coarsely shaking hands a bringing cup to mouth to swallow pills.   Above activity was completed in 5 minutes. I then sat upright in bed under layers above. I could feel the muscles calm and relax, with episode completely ending in 5 minutes. Total time of event: 60 minutes.   Post-event details: There was a mild sensation of muscle tension in the posterior cervical spine akin to whiplash, but no residual symptoms. I debriefed with my husband shortly thereafter (he has been in another room the whole time) and fell asleep by 23:30. Awoke to alarm at 05:00 and able to stretch, accomplish 30 min run, vacuum/mop the floors, and present to work by 08:00am without deficit.  Time of documentation: 11:22 am 1/15/2021

                                                Several hours after receiving the vaccination, I became fatigued and sore with muscle aches in the arm of the vaccine site. That night I woke up with moderate body aches and chills and a dull headache, no fever. The next morning, I awoke feeling very fatigued, severe muscle/body aches, headache and chills, still no fever. I slept most of the day. Extra strength Tylenol helped tremendously with the body aches. I was symptom free the morning of 1/15/2021. I was scheduled to work the day after my vaccination and was unable to due to the symptoms described.  I had no adverse reactions with my first dose.  I am a nursing mother and for the first and second doses, I noticed no side effects or any concerns with my child or milk supply.

This follows Sunday morning with muscle aches, joint pain, headache and nausea. Continuous nausea occurs until vomiting starts sunday mid afternoon. This all continues until Tuesday morning when a Phenergan shot IM is able to be administered at urgent care where I return home and sleep for 24 hours. Tiredness and weakness continue until the morning of Saturday 16th where I wake up feeling &#34;normal&#34; in a sense.

                                                At approximately 9pm the night of the vaccine 2nd dose, I developed a fever. As the night progressed, I also developed severe R arm pain, joint pain, muscle aches in my back, chills, a headache, and fatigue. The fever was as high as 103.1 and improved with tylenol, but lasted for 2 days. Since onset of the back pain, it has persisted and gradually worsened over the past 2 weeks since the injection. I contact my physician, received a prescription for a muscle relaxant, and a referral for physical therapy.

This 28-year-old female nurse (patient) reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3246) at single dose at left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation on 11Jan2021 at 4:30 pm. Relevant history included contraception. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was none. Concomitant drug included ongoing ethinylestradiol, etonogestrel (NUVARING) for contraception for years. The patient experienced a headache, back ache, nausea and was almost passing out. She had the first dose of the vaccine on the 11Jan2021 at 4:30 PM and was in bed around 10:00 that night.  She woke up at 5:00 AM on 12Jan2021 and didn&#39;t feel great, her arm was killing her more than a normal vaccine and she was nauseated at 5:30, which was not that horrible. She took some Tylenol. Then she got to work and around 9:00 she felt like she was going to get sick. She had horrendous nausea, chills, weakness, eye pain, headache/ head pain, and back pain. Her clothes hurt because the body aches were so bad. She felt like she was going to pass out, like a vasovagal. She went to urgent care because her manager didn&#39;t think it was side effect. She went and got swabbed (result unknown), whatever. She had a fever then. They told her it was a reaction to the vaccine. Her temperature was 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit when she went to Urgent care. She would say the fever started at 12:30PM on 12Jan2021. She did not know if fever would be ongoing because she was taking fever reducer and it was working. The events weakness, eye pain, head pain, and back pain were reported as serious since medically significant. The nausea was better around 2:00PM. The outcome of event nausea, Chills was and Weakness was resolved on 12Jan2021.  The outcome of events eye pain, head pain, and back pain was resolving.

I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient herself). A 28-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK4176, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing ulcerative colitis from 2009 and exposure to a positive COVID patient on 08Jan2021. The patient also had a sinus drainage down the back of her throat. It went away but started back up on 09Jan2021. It is the same since last night but had improved from over the weekend. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EH9899, expiry date not reported) on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had her second COVID19 Vaccine dose last Saturday and reported having a &#34;weird reaction&#34;. She had already gone to urgent care and was told to call. She experienced rash from Monday evening in the knees and elbows which spread to face and joint areas (knees, ankles, toe, hip, wrist), which occurred as splotches of red; some were raised bumps with symptoms relieved with Benadryl. Patient said that she was not sure if she was having a reaction or not to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She was just in urgent care that morning and was going to primary care that afternoon. Urgent care thought she was having a reaction. She got her second dose of the vaccine on Saturday morning, 09Jan2021. That night she had the typical immune response.  She had chills, sore muscles, sore throat, fatigue, and facial pain from sinus pressure, which lasted through Sunday. She took Sudafed PE and Monday when she woke up, she felt normal. She experienced rash from Monday evening in the knees and elbows which spread to face and joint areas (knees, ankles, toe, hip, wrist, fingers, feet, face, upper arms), rash which occurred as splotches of red; some were raised bumps with symptoms relieved with Benadryl. Benadryl helped it get better, but after it wears off the rash comes back and it gets worse. It had spread to different areas. Sometimes, it will be really bad on her knees, then other times really bad on her elbows or hips. Her hips were bad last night. Now it is on the bottom of her feet and on her knees again. She asked if these were something that have been previously reported. All of these symptoms, besides the rash, she felt like she had the flu. It knocked her on her ass it was pretty terrible. But it went away and she felt better. It was a typical immune response so she would say it was not serious. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 13Jan2021. Clinical outcome of events chills, sore muscles, sore throat, fatigue, and facial pain from sinus pressure was recovered on 11Jan2021, while for the other events was not recovered.

                                                Walking around house doing chores after working from 9-6 with 90 minute lunch break as a dental hygienist.  Could feel left foot start to go numb and tingling and feel very cold. Took thin sock off foot, pinky toe was purple. Took pictures. Could not get foot to warm up with warm/hot compresses. Started having slight discomfort in lower back/butt with pain going down leg to toe within the hour. I believe this could be coincidence and have sciatic pain, but thought I should report just in case there are few other reported cases on this.   Purple discoloration was gone when woke in morning on 2/23/2021 It is now 2/24/2021 and I am still having sciatic pain and numb pinky toe.

From what I heard this is pretty normal so I had no concerns. Over the next couple days the injection site pain was gone along with the neck pain but the wrist/hand pain persisted. It?s now been a week since the pain started and my wrist/hand/forearm are still really sore/achy. I?ve been icing it multiple times a day but the pain persists. It?s especially bad when typing or doing any repetitive motions with my hand. &#34;

                                                Next morning, I woke up with severe positional headache (headache with standing or sitting up, resolved completely with ibuprofen and tylenol within 20 minutes). The next morning I also had a sore left deltoid, and soreness extending into my left chest and shoulder, which diminished throughout the day after ibuprofen and tylenol. I also had a left swollen armpit, which I interpreted as swollen lymph nodes. My left armpit was sore and was visibly swollen compared to the right. The left lymph node is still visibly swollen as I report this (approximatley 36 hours after vaccine administration), and is sore but less sore than initially.   Of note, when I received the first vaccine in this series, my left deltoid was more sore than with the second administration, but soreness was limited to the deltoid and resolved within 3 days.

                                                Intense pain upon injection not felt with any other form of vaccine. Pain in arm continued to get worse throughout the day. Unable to lift my arm very far without pain. Worse than any other injection recieved in the past. Pain throught the night-causing lack of sleep. Severe pain for about 24 hours or so then completely gone. My muscle in my arm then felt tight as if there was inflammation of some sort or an injury to the muscle. Upon lifting my arm it felt as if my arm was pulling back. No pain during this action but more of a weakness. No relief from anti inflammatory medicaiton or ice. Sensation in arm noted to be gone on 01/09/2021.

                                                Several hours after vaccination, I developed left arm soreness, which persisted for about 36 hours.  Arm soreness was quite severe on 1/8, as it was painful to even lift the left arm for much of the day.  I also noted, about 5 hours after vaccination, that my jaw felt slightly tense, bilaterally.  On Friday, 1/8, I also experienced headache for the entire day, and I was fatigued for much of the day.   I noted clavicular lymph nodes as well.  About 18-20 hours after vaccination, I developed soreness in my back, and about 24 hours after vaccination, I noted some myalgia in the left leg.  These symptoms were responsive to acetaminophen.  The headache, clavicular lymph nodes, arm soreness, and myalgias were resolved by the time I woke up on 1/9.  Finally, I noted development of an axillary lymph node during the evening of 1/8, about 28 hours after vaccination.  This axillary node persisted until Monday, 1/11.

A 29-year-old female patient (pregnant: No) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot/Batch Number and Expiration Date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 12:00 PM (Left arm) at single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 09:00 PM (Arm Right) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The concomitant drug was reported as Escitalopram. The patient experienced pain in the injection site began within a few minutes (05Jan2021 12:15 PM) and gradually increased reaching it&#39;s maximum around 8 hours after the dose. Neck pain was also significant (05Jan2021 12:15 PM). Fatigue, malaise and mild headache started around 10 hours (05Jan2021 22:00) following vaccine administration. Almost 24 hours following administration (06Jan2021 12:00) a fever of 38 C started and persisted for about 6-8 hours. It subsided but severe fatigue and malaise (that prevent me to do daily activities) are still persisting greater than 48 hours following administration. The outcome of severe fatigue and malaise was not recovered. The outcome of Headache, Pain in the injection site, Neck pain, fever of 38 C, was recovering. No treatment received for the adverse event. No COVID prior vaccination and no COVID tested post vaccination.  Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                1 week history of significantly worsened (previously present &#34;low back strain&#34; lower back pain that had become radicular to both LE and associated with progressively worsening bilateral LE weakness, paresthesias since COVID vaccination last week. see continuation for HPI and assessment/plan from office note 1/13/21  HPI from OV dated 1/13/21  She had presented initially in December 2020 for her annual physical, and we evaluated some low back pain that that time, felt to be a sprain/strain resulting from a fall in the shower earlier December which was aggravated significantly by lifting/transferring a patient at the SNF she works for as a nurse. Presentation at that time was rather benign, no imaging obtained, pt was placed on leave from work for 1 week to avoid the heavy lifting and likely aggravation of back pain, and rx including diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine. She did not FU in the office, but returned to work at SNF a week after I saw her for the back pain. She states she had improved enough to feel like she could go back to work but wasn&#39;t 100% without back pain yet. At no time was comp mentioned at the visit in December. She did tell her employer about the injury and was off of work for a week and was encouraged to seek comp. We were never notified.    Yesterday 1/12 she followed up in the office for the back pain and was found to have much more severe pain, now radicular to both LE (pain intensity worse on right), with new neurologic impairment including objective weakness bilateral LE (R&gt;L), sensation disturbance bilateral LE (R&gt;L). Xray of lumbar spine obtained in clinic, this was essentially unremarkable, non-acute.  Pt was sent for stat MRI of the lumbar spine. MRI last night revealed no findings to explain her severe symptoms - she has mild symmetric disc bulging at L5-S1  nd mild bilateral facet arthropathy with patent canal and foramina, and a mild nonspecific  &#34;STIR signal abnormality&#34; within the soft tissues abutting the left lateral aspect of the L5 spinous processes felt to be small and nonspecific. I did discuss the case and the imaging with the radiologist and he feels this is unlikely to be the source of her back pain/radicular symptoms. No obvious signs of apparent discitis or any signficant soft tissue abnormality.    Pt contacted last night with initial &#34;normal&#34; results of MRI as formal results were pending - hydrocodone was sent to her pharmacy for pain relief overnight. Pt received 60mg toradol in the office yesterday during her visit. Pt noted significant improvement in her back pain, bilateral leg pain about 30 minuts after that injection. She continued to have pain in the evening but went to sleep. She woke at 3am unable to roll over due to weakness and pain - her sister gave her a hydrocodone and she went back to sleep&#39; she woke this morning feeling much better; today, she has less severe low back pain, less severe right lower leg radicular pain, NO pain radiating into the left LE, lessening of the weakness in her right LE, lessening of paresthesia reported in the right LE (now isolated just to the heel), resolution of the weakness in the left LE, resolution of the tingling of the left knee. Other than the toradol and one dose of hydrocodone, no other medications were given, no other treatments given since presentation yesterday.   Upon further questioning, patient does reveal that she received the 1st of 2 COVID-19 vaccinations (pfizer) last week. She received the vaccination at work at nursing home on 1/7/21. She had some relatively quick onset nausea and dizziness within an hour of the injection, but that resolved. She recalls feeling like her low back pain, bilateral lower leg pain, leg weakness and paresthesias all intensified sometime either Wednesday 1/6/21 or 1/7/21, but more obviously worsened over the weekend 1/9 and 1/10. Along with the lower extremity symptoms, she does admit today that she experienced soreness in bilateral upper arms starting the day following the vaccine administration, with left arm/shoulder still feeling sore and tender to the touch now. She also developed some altered sensation of the right thumb and index fingers the day following vaccination (1/8/21) and this has been persistent/unchanged. She is right handed. No prior issues with right hand/fingers. Other than the altered sensation, she denies pain, swelling, or notable weakness. She is right handed, and really hasn&#39;t done much with her right hand over the past week since she hasn&#39;t been working. Patient denies having significant headache, fever, chills, diaphoresis, fatigue, rashes/injection site erythema since the covid vaccination. She was not told to sign up for or told about the V-safe program and hadn&#39;t thought to report her symptoms to work or think to be concerned regarding possible vaccine SE. Pt denies prior hx of low back pain, neurologic symptoms including weakness/paresthesias, previous allergy to or adverse reaction to vaccination or injectable medications. She has a history of latent TB(fully treated) but is otherwise in good health.  After gathering much further detailed information/history today from patient, review of chart including the MRI results and xray results from yesterday, my prior OV note, and discussion with radiologist today regarding her MRI - I Discussed with patient and her sister that I believe what is becoming more apparent to me now is that she is likely suffering from an adverse event associated with the COVID-19 vaccination she received on 1/7/21 through her workplace. I&#39;m unable to define this for certain, but I suspect that she developed the progressive worsening of low back pain, development of radicular pain and bilateral LE weakness and paresthesias about 1-2 days following the vaccination administration. She has had notable and rather surprising improvement in both subjective and objective findings  Today as compared to yesterday. Only intervention was toradol 60mg IM and one dose of hydrocodone, she had already been taking diclofenac or ibuprofen so I believe the only explanation for the improvement over the past 24 hours is the fact that she is gradually having resolution of the temporary paraparesis, neuralgia, paresthesia brought on by the recent COVID-19 vaccination. I believe she truly had injury to the low back in December, initial injury at home but had improvmenet and then significant worsening/exacerbation when transferring a resident at work. Her presentation following that was consistent with a strain/sprain of the lumbar spine. This was treated appropriately with rest, activity modification, stretching, NSAID, and muscle relaxers. She returned to work w/o restriction likely earlier than she should have but I believe the covid vaccination is likely what caused her condition to so significantly decline; Its also possible that her physically demanding job requiring lifting/transferring/standing for prolonged periods of time on top of an only partially resolved low back strain had aggravated her low back condition.    plan from OV dated 1/13/21 Given the improvement since yesterday, I recommended obtaining some labs looking for any sign of alternative explanation including infectious etiology or autoimmune/inflammatory condition, however will hold on further imaging as would be the plan, specifically EMG of the bilateral LEs. Explained to patient that I&#39;m hopeful with continued rest and time, her symptoms (weakness, tingling/numbness, radicular back pain) will completely resolve. She may need some eventual PT for the disc bulge in the lumbar spine and lumbar strain that is likely still lingering. Will contact pt with any change in care plan based on the laboratory findings. I would like to closely follow her, and make sure her symptoms continue to slowly improve /resolve. If at any point she develops worsening symptoms again or any new neurologic signs/symptoms (and we discussed what emergency signs/symptoms would be) then she needs to be in touch with me right away. I will work on reporting this suspected adverse covid vaccine reaction to VAERS / possibly also CDC and see if they have any additional input/suggestions for monitoring/treatment.    For pain control, pt may continue with the diclofenac OR ibuprofen, and the hydrococone/APAP as needed for breakthrough severe pain uncontrolled with the NSAID. I have advised pt to remain off of work at this time, resting at home avoiding lots of physical activity as she continues to heal. Suspect will have her follow up in clinic sometime next week for repeat evaluation/examination depending on VAERS/CDC recommendations and of course the lab results and any updated condition reports from the patient in the interim. Will want to make sure she has full resolution of the paresis and adequate resolution of her back pain/radicular pain prior to returning to work, even in a limited capacity. I am informed today that there is light duty available and will keep that in mind. Pt to be contacted regarding follow up. Encouraged to call with questions/concerns/updates. Pt was very thankful for the care.

                                                I received my second dose of the vaccine at 03:00pm on 1/12/21. I noticed around 06:00pm that I started feeling a little tired and some pain around the injection site. I had anticipated this as I felt similar symptoms from the first dose of the vaccine. I took a nap and woke up around 09:00pm feeling some of the worst body aches I had felt in a long time. My arm that I received my vaccine in was painful and warm to the touch. I felt dehydrated as well so I drank a pedialyte, took OTC Tylenol extra strength, and laid down again. Around 07:00am on 1/13/21, I still felt achy, sweaty, and felt pain in the arm that I recieved the vaccine in. I went into my bathroom, and noticed two small red and raised areas around the injection site. I took pictures of the site, and continued to closely monitor through out the day. I ended up calling in sick to work on 1/13/21. It is now around 12:00pm on 1/14/21, and I woke up with a pounding headache, muscle aches, dehydration, nausea, and low energy. I feel like I am hungover or have the flu, and am planning on calling in sick to work again. I reported my symptoms to my staffing department at my workplace on 1/13/21 and wanted to file a report here as well.

Outcome of event fever was recovered, of others was not recovered.

Around midnight I woke up with chills, and severe arthralgias in all joints down to the toes and fingers, and deep, boring pain in my long bones and neck. My skin and fingertips felt like they were burning. I was nauseated but didn?t vomit. I was up all night because I couldn?t find a position I wasn?t in pain in. Tmax 100.3 F. Took a gram of Tylenol with improvement of symptoms. Felt better in AM but when Tylenol wore off around 9 am, had another wave of the same pain all over. Tylenol improved. Felt almost completely normal by 4 pm with the exception of some lingering low back pain (central not muscular).

                                                Second dose of COVID vaccine (Pfzier/BioNTech) received Friday morning around 8:00, I left work about an hour early that day due to rising nausea, migraine and fatigue. By the time I got to my car in the parking garage I had thrown up and was so dizzy that I called my boyfriend to come pick me up. When I got home I immediately laid down to take a nap. 3 hours later I woke up very sore and achy and still had a migraine. I remained in bed and later that night I spiked a fever as high as 101.8 fahrenheit. I had severe chills and the aches were so bad that my bones hurt all over and it felt like someone was stabbing me with a metal broom handle. Pain spiked to 8 on the pain scale and with the length of time I had this pain, it was one of the worst experiences of my life. The dizziness and fatigue caused me to need help to get out of bed to use the restroom. I took ibuprofen frequently and Nyquil at night to help relieve the effects without it doing little more than taking the edge off. Saturday night was the same as Friday night with no relief of symptoms. Fever remained around 100.9. Sunday night it dropped to 99.8 with chills, dizziness and fatigue still remaining but aches slightly lessening. Monday night I was still dizzy and weak but not nearly as in much pain and fever had subsided. Tuesday I started to feel more normal by the end of the night, just easily out of breath and off and on again headache.

I a had an intolerable headache on the entire bottom of my head that made my neck start to hurt.   I felt nausea that did not improve until four days later. My joints were hurting sharply  two days after the immunization and lasted two days.    Most of my symptoms improved on the 13th of January, but were still lingering.  About 5 days after the shot my symptoms resolved completely.

                                                First Dose-  I had a headache after the shot and tremors started that even and throughout the night. No fevor. Arm very sore, going into neck.   Second Dose-  Felt find the night. Woke up that morning at 1am and with tremors and in a night sweat. Checked temp and it was only 96, but felt hot and was sweating. Woke up the next morning and my entire body, muscles and joints ached. My knuckles, ached, kept getting sharp pains in my knuckles. My jaw ached, difficulty eating. My entire body, my muscle ached, difficulty moving. I didn&#39;t get a headache till that evening. I also had severe heart burn that night, not sure if it was related, but I have never had heart burn that bad. The next morning when I woke up (5am) (now two days after my shot), again my joints hurts, I couldn&#39;t even stand.  Its like my knees couldn&#39;t even support me and I had a massive headache.  I went back to bed and woke around 9am, no longer had a headache, muscles still hurt. Around 11am, all of a sudden, muscles and joints felt fine.   The only thing (day three) is my arm pit on my left side where i got the shot is bothering my extremely bad.  I was able to put an ultrasound probe on my axilla area, and I have swollen lymph nodes in my axilla in the area that is very painful. I also have a dull pain in my elbow.

By that point I was in bed almost all day with muscle pain in my torso (back, ribs, abdominal). I also had a severe migrane and a fever that at it&#39;s worst was 102.3. It was brought down quickly with ice to 100.7 within an hour. After about 8 hours it subsided for about 20 minutes before the torso pain and migrane came back. The fever stayed around 100.3 when I last checked. I went back to sleep for the rest of the night and felt fine in the morning with no fever.

                                                &#34;Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34; I received my 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Jan. 20th, 2021.  On Jan. 21st, 2021, I woke up feeling feverish.  I went to use the bathroom, and after washing my hands I walked towards the bathroom door and felt light-headed and dizzy.  Suddenly, I passed out and hit my head and upper neck on the tile floor.  My parents heard the sound of my fall and luckily rushed to the bathroom.  They found me lying  unconscious on the floor with my eyes rolled up for what felt like more than a minute.  I regained consciousness on my own, and I drank water with a bit of sugar and salt mixed in.    I felt too weak to get up and walk, and the back of my head and upper neck were in pain.  I told my parents to call 911 as I wanted to make sure that there was no serious damage to my brain or neck area.  I went to the local hospital in an ambulance.  I was taken to the emergency room: Vitals were done and my temperature ranged from then was 99.5-101F and my heart rate was high- it stayed around 112 bpm for some time I was given 2 L of IV Saline Fluids EKG result: no clinical abnormalities CT head/neck/spine: negative 2 different types of COVID-19 tests: results were both negative Bloodwork: CBC/BMP/D-dimer: no clinical abnormalities Chest Xray: negative 2D- doppler ultrasound: negative Holter monitor: negative for irregular heart rhythm I was discharged the same day around 4:30pm

                                                After the vaccine was administered, 5-10 minutes later I began to feel a rapid heart rate. One of the nurses came to check on me, I described to her my symptoms, and she let me know if they get worse to inform her. In the next 5 minutes, my head began to hurt, as well as, some chest pain. She checked on me again, and said to let her know if things got worse. Within the next 5-10 minutes after, I had difficulty swallowing and speaking. I raised my hand, and the nurse came over, then proceeded to get help. They then took my blood pressure and heart rate. My blood pressure was 185/103 and I believe my pulse was 156 bpm. I was still having a hard time swallowing and speaking. They proceeded to get an epi pen and the doctor on site, as well as suggested to send me over the ER/ call 911. The doctor checked my lungs, and they noticed my blood pressure and heart rate was not decreasing to a normal level. I was then put in a wheel chair and transferred to the ER. At the ER, my blood pressure and heart rate was still elevated, as well as difficulty swallowing. The doctor ordered Benadryl via IV, steroids, and the epi pen. After having a reaction to the Benadryl, the epi pen was put on hold. After about 15 minutes, I began to feel better. I was put on IV fluids and observation. I was able to leave the ER around 12 pm 2/05/21. At this time,  7:22 pm, I am feeling better with mild muscle aches, and fatigue.

The first dose of bnt162b2 was taken on 17Dec2020. The patient&#39;s medical history included bipolar disorder. Concomitant medications included quetiapine (QUETIAPINE). The patient experienced some kind of back pain, behind her heart, heart pain and pretty strong chest pain on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered. In addition experienced &#34;fatigue caused by the vaccine was so profound that was advised to not take her bipolar medication, quetiapine&#34; on an unspecified date with outcome of recovered. It was reported that &#34;It took 36 hours for the extreme fatigue to stop. This was very frightening because being without the medication could cause auditory hallucinations to return after 36 hours. There should be a warning for people who must take sedative medication regularly so that they can make an informed decision about whether or not to receive the vaccine&#34;.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was reported as no. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccine. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes omeprazole, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (MARLISSA), venlafaxine and gabapentin from unspecified dates, received within 2 weeks of vaccination, for unspecified indication. Patient historically took first dose of Pfizer BNT162B2 (Lot number: EN6204) on 13Mar2021 at 11:00 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient previously took hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN) on an unspecified date and indication and had allergy. On 02Apr2021, around 10pm, patient began having chills and extreme muscle pain and spasms, and the lymph nodes in her left armpit swelled up so much that she couldn&#39;t put her arm down without extreme pain.  By midnight (03Apr2021 00:00), patient had a fever and was unable to stand unassisted. She was writhing in pain and arching uncontrollably off the bed.  She believed in hindsight that this was a seizure as she went in and out of consciousness and her tongue swelled up, making it hard to breathe and impossible to speak. She was sweating profusely, and had to drink water constantly.  Her husband had to help her get to the bathroom because she couldn&#39;t support her own body without tipping over.  The chills and fever alternated all night, and she finally passed out from exhaustion at 03Apr2021 at 7am. The next 2 days, she was in a cycle of fever and chills again, and the fever got so bad that she seized twice more on Saturday (03Apr2021).  She had to take the day off work on Monday (05Apr2021) as she was still in so much pain that she could barely leave bed except to use the bathroom. Events were reported as life-threatening, immediate risk of death from the events. Patient was not hospitalized. Treatment for the adverse events were cool baths, naproxen (ALEVE) for fever and pain, and PEDIALYTE. COVID-19 was not tested post vaccination. Vaccination facility type was at a hospital. The outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 29-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 30Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The reporter is not related to a study or program. Concomitant medications included unspecified medication (She does take other medications but does not know the significance). On 30Mar2021, the physician stated that, the patient developed immediate right-side neck pressure, skin and jaw tingling, and swollen lymph nodes. She did not have any trouble breathing and did not have any hives. These events were considered as medically significant. The pharmacist gave her 2 Benadryl and she stayed there for an hour. She said she does not think the Benadryl did anything for her. The physician stated that the patient went home and slept off the immediate reaction she experienced and had fatigue for 3 days. The patient had fatigue for 3 days and no other problems. The physician inquired on advisable information for the second dose. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported serious events cannot be completely ruled out given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association.

Since then, I lost feeling in my hands and feet, numbness and tingling.  I&#39;ve improved however, during my recovery suffered with spinal pain, shortness of breath, very winded, muscle pain and loss of appetite to especially meat.

Not much longer and the hives/itching spread down my back and chest. Face became swollen. Benadryl cream was initially attempted, but only briefly subsided the itching and reaction continued spreading. I took oral quick release Benadryl and was able to prevent the reaction from continuing. I had to take a secondary Benadryl dose a few hours later and extreme joint pain accompanied the allergic reaction.

Approximately 7-8 days after my vaccination, my left armpit started feeling sore. This has continued to today where I have left armpit swelling and what feels to be a swollen, hardened lymph node in my armpit. It feels like a hardened lump that is not fixed and is tender when I palpate it. On visual inspection, I can tell that my left armpit is more swollen than my right armpit (which is normal). It hurts to have my arm at my side and it hurts to lay on my left side at night when I am sleeping.

At that point, I started to get very dizzy and lightheaded. Every time I opened my eyes, everything was spinning. This lasted four about 3-4 hours. I kept breaking out into sweats. I had a horrible headache for about 4 days straight. I am still continuing to having headaches. I am still having hot flashes and dizziness episodes at times that go away after about a few minutes. Two days ago, I stated to developing swelling in my hands with achy joints which has not gone away.

                                                When vaccine was administered, seemed high on my arm.  I had immediate soreness and shoulder discomfort, I was told this was normal.  It continued to progress and I eventually had decreased ROM, weakness and sharp shooting pain in my shoulder.  Working at OI, I consulted provider, xrays were obtained and I was evaluated.  He strongly suggested an MRI be obtained as well.  That was completed the same day as my evaluation on 12/31/2020 (1 week and 2 days after the vaccine was administered).  The provider informed me that they have had patients with similar situations that were evaluated for frozen shoulder after having a vaccine d/t administration site and vaccine going into subacromial space.  He does report that this was my case/situation, upon my exam, I had severe inflammation with this as well-he is now having me follow up for a surgical consultation for my shoulder to be repaired.  Today&#39;s date is 1/7/2021, I have these same ongoing symptoms that have continued since day of administration, without diminishing in severity.  He is unable to provide an injection d/t my upcoming second dose of the COVID vaccine this next week, 1/12/2021.  He strongly suggests that my 2nd vaccine be administered elsewhere-advised NOT be administered in the same shoulder OR in opposite to cause these symptoms to flare.  He advised in gluteus if possible to avoid any further issues if at all possible.

The next morning I had a fever and my joints, muscles, head and even my skin was hurting. My fever never came down to normal even with advil and I was extremely tired all day.  The arm that had the injection is extremely sore with splotches of red (which is expected.) Today, 01/08, I woke up in a pool of sweat. My head is still hurting and I still have a fever. My arm is still sore but my skin and joint pain has improved. I am still very cold. Have been wearing my winter coat in my house even with the heat and the fire place on. I had to take the last two days off work.

                                                About 12 hours of receiving my second dose I started to get really bad chills. Nothing could keep me warm and I had a fever of 102.  I had muscle aches  as if I just went through a rigorous workout. I had zero appetite but I?m not sure if that was due to side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. When I did finally eat something that evening I could barely taste it, I ate it but my taste buds were faintly picking up the flavors. Again I don?t know if it was because of the side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. The following day, Saturday 01/09/21 I only had chills which would come and go. I did not have fever and my appetite was back. Now today, 01/10/21 I feel my usual self.

I went home and slept after working night shift. I woke up at 11 am, 17 hours post vaccine, and had a 102.4 F fever, chills, body aches and headache. At 3pm I still had 102-103F fever and called employee health and in which was directed to take Tylenol or Advil. I took 600mg Advil, and my fever broke at 8 pm, 26 hours post vaccine. That night my fever returned 102-103 F, I continued to take Advil. I took Advil around the clock, but let it lapse in dose Saturday evening 50 hours after receiving my vaccine. I then had a 101.5 F temp, I waited and it continued to rise, at midnight tonight, 30 mins ago, I took 600 mg Advil

                                                I developed mild injection site pain about 5 minutes after the second dose which didn?t happen the first time so quickly. It shortly progressed to a cold/numb sensation from my deltoid down to my finger tips. This persisted but seemed to transition from more numbness to moderate pain from my left scapula, neck and down to my fingers about 7 hours after the vaccine. I also developed intermittent fasiculations of my forearm muscles on the left arm. This morning I woke up with worsening pain, mild numbness but new weakness in the hand and arm. I have a weak grip and can?t fully grab objects. My wrist flexión and extension are also weak as well as shoulder abduction (I am a neurologist by the way so can?t localize it to any nerve distribution). I?m not weak anywhere else and I only have mild arthralgia and diarrhea systemically.

Around 2100 the same night, rapidly progressing paresthesia of complete left face without obvious facial palsy yet (numbness happened over the course of about 30min to the point where I had no perception of touch in the left face).  At this point I took 60mg of prednisone and went to bed. When I woke up, the paresthesia/stiffness was less and progressively so since finishing a course of prednisone.   Concerned that this could have been a bells palsy reaction to the vaccine.

A 30-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number Ej1685) at a single dose at 09:45 AM 07Jan2021 at left arm for Covid-19 immunization in a hospital. The patient had her first dose of Pifzer Covid-19 vaccine on 21Dec2020 at 12:00 PM at left arm, and experienced very mild reactions which included mild pain at injection site and runny nose/sneezing day after vaccine. The paitent had a medical hisotry of rash to penicillin as a child. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to her first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. In the evening of second vaccine (around 17:00), pain and stiffness radiated from injection site all the way down arm, into breast, and middle of back. She started having chills. Around 10 hours after dose chills became somewhat violent despite being under 4 blankets. Severe headache also started. In the middle of the night to go to bathroom, she collapsed on the way back and was unable to get up for about 20 minutes. She also suffered from tachycardia overnight. her baseline heart rate runs in 60s- 70s, but was in 110s-120s (based on Apple Watch monitoring). Day after vaccine, she was extremely fatigue entire day and spent all but a few hours in bed. Arm pain mostly gone. Headache was very strong and persistent through the day. On second night chills not as bad but still occurred overnight. HR still elevated in 80s overnight. Morning of day 2 still had headache and fatigue. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The outcome of collapse and unable to get up for 20minutes, pain and stiffness radiating from injection site all the way down arm,into breast, and middle of back was resolved, chills and tachycardia was resolving, headache, fatigue was not resolved. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                On the evening and day following receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chills, body muscle aches, headache, and fever (99.7-100.2 degrees). I was unable to get out of bed or go to work. I took ibuprofen at first, for my muscle pain but was told I should instead take Tylenol to reduce my fever and address my pain. My fever and chills recurred last night at about 8pm and I took more Tylenol.   Today, I am still experiencing some pain in my arm (injection site) and some chills/dizziness, but am taking Tylenol and have not experienced any recurring fever since last night. I am continuing to drink a lot of fluid and take a low dose of Tylenol at regular intervals.

                                                On Monday, January 25, 2021, at 11:40am I received the second dose of a series for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Over the course of the rest of that day, I began to develop a headache and mild neck soreness. That night, I slept poorly. When I awoke just before 5:00am the next day, Tuesday, January 26, I did not feel well. I was experiencing headache, malaise, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia, and low-grade fever. I called my supervisor around 5:30am that day and we decided it was best that I stay home to recuperate. Throughout the day, I mostly rested and slept, took Tylenol, and began to feel better in the mid-afternoon. I did call and leave a voicemail for hospital Employee Health around 1:30pm on Tuesday the 26th, but did not hear back. Today, Wednesday, January 27, I am feeling much better, and well enough to come to work.

About 6 hrs after vaccine, I felt soreness at the injection site, very similar to the flu vaccine. About 12Hours post vaccine, my arm was so sore I could not lift it. That night I took two Tylenol and had to wrap my arm in a heating pad. I woke up around 3am that following morning with a fever of 104 F. I was so dizzy from the high fever. I felt extremely nauseated. My body ached mostly in my legs and lower back. It hurt to sit on the toilet, to put on clothes. My Fevers happened at night time ranging from 102-104F for 4 days. My injection site soreness lasted for 7 days. Body aches lasted around 2-3 days. Dizziness subsided after my fever broke, but was replaced with a severe headache lasting 2 days.

The symptoms were relieved by taking extra strength tylenol every 4 hours. The symptoms were lessened, but still present until 9:30 AM on Wednesday.  I was still suffering from a minor headache all day Thursday. I also had soreness in the injection site, there was no swelling or redness that I noticed; the soreness was mostly gone by Thursday. I have had a left eyelid twitch in the past (randomly), it returned after the vaccine and was very bothersome. Today is Thursday and the eyelid twitch is still bothering me.

A 30-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 11Feb2021 15:30 at a single dose (at the age of 30-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included &gt;13 years ago: diagnosed TB with no symptom, completed TB treatment 1 year-plan and has issue no since then; &gt;16 years ago: Hepatitis-b positive but received treatment and cleared out on diagnostics afterward. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient has no known allergies. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) on 21Jan2021 at 13:15 on the left arm at a single dose (at the age of 30-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. After about 4.5h post-vaccination (20:00), her left arm felt sore and within the next 3h, she felt sleepy and experienced random light drowsiness. She woke up around 06:30 the next day (12Feb2021) only felt continued sore arm. However, at 08:30 to 09:30, her whole body felt sore and exhausted, especially back pain, as if she having a bad cold/flu. She also felt a little chest pain, had a minor fever and went sleeping from 12:00, woke up around 18:00-19:00. The whole body ache was almost gone but her back was still in pain and her blood pressure dropped with random dizziness when she was walking or standing up. The next morning (13Feb2021), the back pain was gone and she felt it back to normal except for a little random dizziness in movement. She did not take any medication to alleviate the adverse effects during the timeline. The patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The patient recovered from back pain in 13Feb2021, the patient recovered from the remaining events in Feb2021.

                                                Night after vaccine severe chills, muscle aches. When waking in morning, had neck pain and muscle spasms. Was in severe pain in neck with difficulty swallowing.  Went to urgent care and was given muscle relaxers. Pain continued for 3 weeks after, severe still. Began chiropractor visits, no improvement. Had MRI completed, showed golf ball sized lymph node swelling in neck on side of severe pain. Went to ENT for course of steroids with mild improvement. Still having mild to moderate neck pain everyday and it has been 2 months since vaccine. Would never get this type of vaccine again, and I am a medical professional who usually trusts them.

This was controlled 3 hours later by tylenol. For the next 36 hours post symptom onset my sinuses were still affected, my muscles felt very weak and the glands in my neck felt swollen. Everything has resolved except the swollen glands in my neck and my sinsuses being dry and painful.

By 2030 I had severe full body chills and could not stop shaking. I had a severe headache/migraine. Every muscle in my body hurt. This continued on for the entire night. Got tested for COVID the next morning with the rapid results and the symptoms continued with the muscle aches and severe headache. Vision became blurry and I became very dizzy. Slept for 8 hours during the day on 1/7/2021 and then slept another 12 hours that night. The body aches and headaches continued until 1/8/2021 at which the symptoms finally subsided

A 31-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose in deltoid right for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on 03Jan2021 and within 15 minutes had a generalized headache. Later that night she had generalized muscle weakness and pain, but really didn&#39;t think too much about it. The next day at work (04Jan2021), she had numbness on the right upper side of her lip and a pins and needle feeling in the right upper quadrant of the face. Had a lot of pain in the area as well on the right upper side of the face as well as a dull aching pain that lasted for hours. Later that day when using the computer and she was trying to reach for her mouse she noticed her right hand wasn&#39;t able to feel anything and that lasted about 20-25 minutes. Kept slapping the mouse with her hand, but could not feel anything, her hand went numb. Yesterday (05Jan2021), she had the same pins and needle feeling in the same area of the face and that dull achy feeling and it occurred for hours and it was very kind of debilitating for her at work.  Later that night she had pain in her right leg and felt the same way, that very severe achiness, which was the pins and needles feeling up and down the leg and underneath the right foot. All these symptoms tend to be on her right side and it definitely lasted for hours. It started about 1 and didn&#39;t end until 6-7pm. It even hurts to move the right eye in one direction and hurts to speak, the pain was so bad. This morning (06Jan2021) she had to call out of work because at 3am the generalized headache, pain was unbearable. She was still experiencing the pain in right leg and bottom sole of right foot. She did not receive any vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. She had made an appointment with a neurologist and will have a MRI done on Friday, 08Jan2021. No further details provided. All events required a visit to physician office. All events were reported as serious per medically significant. The outcome of all events was not resolved.

                                                On  12/25 I was driving home and my left arm got numb, tingly and weak to the the point where I thought I was suffering from a stroke.  I  rushed to my moms and had her to drive me to the hospital where they did a neuro check to include a CT scan which ruled out the stroke but the symptoms lasted about 4 days which came and went with the pain and intensity varying each time which ended around 12/29.  I suffered from body aches and night chills one night.  Around the 12/29 I began to have pressure around the back of my head which felt as if I was laying on bricks when I laid down.  It got to the point to where I couldnt sleep which caused me to go back to the ER on  1/1 where I was given  toradol, decadron and sudafed which allowed me to sleep. I was released from the ER with Motrin 800 and contined to take that and Tylenol until the headaches ceased  which was about 3 or 4 days later. The headache went away but the pressure still remained.  My lymph glands were swollen so I was also given a prescription for amoloxicillin.

                                                Patient started to have a local injection site reaction on 1/10/21 at around 9:10am. The injection site had some redness and swelling. By the afternoon on 1/10/21 the red and swelling increased and by 1/12/21 the redness was the size of a half dollar and swelling just beyond the redness. The area is warm to touch. Pt also had symptoms of nausea, fatigue, and muscle pain. Pt was instructed to take Zyrtec BID &amp; pepcid. When I talked to the patient on 1/13/2021, the injection site remains the same and still feels nauseated.

I took Tylenol 500mg and used Bengay cream on my neck with no relief. I saw my doctor at 0945 that morning. He prescribed Norco, flexeril, and diclofenac. By 1/13/2021 I was able to turn my head ¾ of the way to the left but still have pain. By today, 01/14/2021, I am able to almost completely turn my head but there is still pain, however it is improving and I have increased range of motion.

Then, 1-14-21 starting around 8am, I developed GI symptoms, stomach cramping, nausea, and also light-headed and muscle aches. I left work and at home developed a headache and fever of 100.8 F which reduced to 100.2 F with ibuprofen. The fever went away over night so I came to work the next day 1/15/21 and continue to have stomach cramping and slight nausea and was concerned about the fever the day before so that is when I called employee health.

                                                High fever 101.9 began the evening when I got my shot and as of an hour ago just came under the 100 mark. I?ve been taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours to combat high fever but it wasn?t going down. I had chills with the fever, so bad that my body was shaking. Fever stayed in the 101 range from Monday evening until Wednesday morning. Extreme shoulder pain radiating from left to right on Monday evening - lasted into the early morning on Tuesday. Chest tightness with R shoulder pain Tuesday afternoon from roughly 130p-315p. It subsided and so I did not seek medical attention. I?ve also had a severe migraine the entire time since getting my shot, but haven?t taken my Ubrelvy as I wasn?t sure how my body would react.

Around 7:00 that night began to have back pain, fever reached up to 102 around 2:00 am and took Tylenol. Felt very weak, headache, difficulty walking and decreased balance. On Jan 5, 2021 still had back ache and headache. On Jan 6, 2021 I felt better and began to have abdominal pain after eating dinner. I assumed it may be because of eating more then I had in past few days and did not attribute to much but the pain gradually increased to a strange burning/pressure across my upper abdomen that night. Very nauseous and ran low grade fever (99.45). Next morning I had less diffuse pain and could localize it to right lower quadrant.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

On 01/20/21 I also started developing stiffness and pain on may arms, hands and feet on both sides. I reported symptoms to Urgent Care. Since then the pain has increased and is now worse on my right hand side-arms, feet; leg-up the glutes and face. I was seen on Urgent Care on 01/22/21 and was told to take OTC ibuprofen. Since symptoms worsened I went to ED on 01/24/21 and was told to keep taking ibuprofen and follow-up with my PCP. I saw my PCP on 01/25/21 and was told to continue monitoring symptoms, continue ibuprofen and f/u in week. I was also prescribed an Hydroxyzine to help with anxiety.

                                                8 days after my  first vaccine shot, on Jan 19th night, I suddenly started having  pain in the chest. The pain was located in the left side of the lower end of the sternum, in the epigastric region. Pain lasted for 3-4 hours. Initially it was severe, pulsating, acute pain as if nerve pressing against chest. Unbearable pain. I was unable to lie down, turn on sides. Pain would aggravate on movements and if I would touch the specific spot in my chest. . Deep breaths reduced the pain to some extent. Pain severity decreased after 4 hours after which I started getting pain in my left arm, radiating to my pinky finger.  The pain also  radiates to left upper back on movements and exerting left arm for long time, especially typing computer keyboard, doing daily chores cooking, washing dirty dishes, sleeping on the side. ,I am unable to sleep on the left side, if I sleep on left side, I start getting tingling and numbness in my left arm. I did not take any pain medications until Jan 26th as the pain did not disappear. Once at night the pain also radiated to my left leg , I felt  numbness when I tried to sleep on my left side. Occasionally, I feel pain in my right arm and right back. The pain near the sternum area reduced significantly when I took two doses of Ibuprofen 600 on Jan 26th in the afternoon and night. The pain in left arm radiating towards left pinky still persists, with numbness and tingling  if I do daily task for longer duration. Ibuprofen helps to relieve pain temporarily.  Mild pain in right arm, neck and upper arm. I will continue to closely monitor my symptoms.

                                                I am reporting my symptoms through this avenue because the VAERS wouldn&#39;t let me complete my daily report on that day (no submit button found).  I had malaise a few hours after the shot. 12 hours after the shot, this turned into a fever that would peak at 103 within the next 12 hours. Fever was accompanied by severe chills, moderate headache, moderate muscle aches, mild joint aches, and mild nausea. I also had a swollen lymph node under my armpit ipsilateral to the injection, the diameter of a baseball. Discomfort from the lymph node was mild. The fever and chills were so bad that I couldn&#39;t do any daily activities and stayed in bed all day. I called a nurses line to ask them if I could take something for the discomfort and they advised Tylenol, so I took 1000 mg. Tylenol did bring down the fever to 101 and the fever rose back to 103, 9 hours after Tylenol. All the aforementioned symptoms lasted for 3 days, and the severe symptoms decreased in severity to &#34;moderate&#34; after about 36 hours.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: ELO140, expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Jan2021 at 11:45 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included neuropathy and migraine.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. Patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medications included cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) and acacia senegal, ascorbic acid, betacarotene, calcium carbonate, calcium pantothenate, calcium silicate, cellulose microcrystalline, colecalciferol, croscarmellose sodium, cyanocobalamin, dextrin, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, ferrous fumarate, folic acid, gelatin, glucose, hypromellose, lecithin, macrogol, magnesium oxide, magnesium stearate, nicotinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol acetate, riboflavin, silicon dioxide, starch, thiamine mononitrate, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide (ONE-A-DAY WOMEN&#39;S) on unspecified dates for unspecified indications. The patient has not had other vaccines in four weeks. On 10Jan2021, three hours after being vaccinated (at approximately 3:00 PM), the patient experienced complete numbness to her left leg (from her ankle to her hip/waist). Hours later, the patient noted numbness to her left arm. Her left knee was buckling, making walking very difficult. The patient reported to the ER, and after several hours of waiting to be seen by a doctor, her right side also became slightly numb, and was also tingling. 18 hours after symptom onset (at approximately 9:30am, the day following injection), the numbness on her right side resolved. It was also reported that the numbness on her left side did not completely resolve for more than 24 hours.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab test which was negative on 13Jan2021 . Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included anti-anxiety medication for calming. The outcome of the events left knee was buckling, making walking very difficult and tingling was recovered on unspecified date, while the rest of the events was recovering at the time of report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported complete numbness to her left leg (from her ankle to her hip/waist)/numbness to her left arm,  left knee was buckling,  walking very difficult, right side also became slightly numb and tingling, and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

A 31-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL3247, Expiry date 31May2021, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Jan2021 at 07:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization as frontline worker. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Hospital. The patient reported that she was fine all day Saturday (16Jan2021), she just had some very mild pain at the injection site started a couple hours after getting injection. She developed flu like symptoms on the following day (17Jan2021) at 18:00PM and threw up a couple times. On 18Jan2021 at noon she noticed that she could barely move her arm: anything above her elbow on her right arm was not moving; it was paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up. If someone were to pick it up and let go, she couldn&#39;t control it at all. She also stated that she had no pain at all in that arm; she couldn&#39;t feel anything at all; it was numb. When she woke up on 19Jan2021 the numbness had moved up her neck, instead of being localized to her arm. She stated that when she touched her neck, it hurt a little, but it was not super significant. She stated that it was debilitating at that point as she was maintaining numbness and &#34;no control of her arm&#34;. The nurse reported that this event had not required yet a visit to physician, but she has a feeling it will. She will probably have to go somewhere due to her paralyzed arm, but she had not yet. At the time of the report the event &#34;No control of her arm&#34;/can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; had not resolved yet; the event &#34;mild pain at the injection site&#34; resolved on 17Jan2021, the events &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; and &#34;Threw up a couple times&#34; were recovering and outcome of the events &#34;Numbness has moved up her neck&#34; and &#34;She touches her neck, it hurts a little&#34; was unknown.

                                                The night of the second dose of my Pfizer Covid vaccine, my face began to feel hot and tight. The next day, I began with the expected flu like symptoms of the vaccine, accompanied by a red, fine bumpy rash with some swelling on my face where it had felt hot and tight the evening prior. The flu like symptoms lasted about 24 hours. The facial rash persisted and I began oral antihistamines - diphenhydramine and famotidine. The rash continued for one full week, only improving after beginning to use topical hydrocortisone on my face at the suggestion of a friend who is a nurse practitioner. After improvement in the rash I stopped hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash reappeared about 5 days later, and continues to randomly reappear about once a week to every 10 days. Flares only last about 24-36 hours now and will go away without medication but it does clear faster with hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash only flares at night, and no triggers like heat, alcohol or certain foods seem to bring it out.  I have been consistently taking famotidine and cetirizine daily since the last flare of the rash, and have not experienced a flare again yet.

Patient reports she has been told she has a high resting heart rate on prior healthcare encounters, especially when she has been seen here in our facility for asthma exacerbations.  She states because of this she has worn a Holter monitor with no evidence of arrhythmia.  Over the past year or so she has had a few episodes of heart palpitations described as a flip-flopping or fluttering or irregularity of her heartbeat.  She had a few hours worth of palpitations after receiving her first Covid vaccination a few weeks ago.  She received second Covid vaccination yesterday and has had off-and-on palpitations both last night and throughout the day today.  Beginning this morning she developed a sharp constant pleuritic discomfort in the left upper back near the shoulder blade, which is worse with deep breath.  No fever, cough or dyspnea.  No anterior chest pain whatsoever.  No leg swelling.  No history of DVT or PE.

Other symptoms gone 1/1-2 Arm/ injection site soreness slowly fades  1/2: exercise for the day= 70 min yoga and 7.5 miles of walking. Had a couple glasses of wine at dinner (possibly relevant if issues with vaccine are related to high histamine food issues)  1/3  Moderate headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Skin feels hot. Sore throat worse than the previous days. Mild runny nose. Severe nausea. Go to Urgent care for COVID test and Zofran Rx. COVID rapid test and PCR test both negative.

                                                Recieved the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccination on Dec 26th 2020, and had no major adverse reaction to vaccine except for mild soreness and heat around injection site and intense fatigue for three days after. Symptoms went away after the 4th day. Two weeks later on Jan 5th 2021, i began to notice an intense itching, burning, and swelling at the injection site. Pain and soreness in arm made it difficult to do my job and seem to just get worse. Upon the next morning of Jan 6th 2021, pain remained but itching had gone down, but intense burning, soreness and massive redness around injection site remained and seemed to be getting worse. Pain remains and redness has not gone down, arm is very tender near site and lifting and moving arm is very stiff and sore. Feeling of lump or stiffness on injection site comes and goes and feeling of heavy and sore muscles move from upper left arm down to elbow and extend to hand; making movement and function slowed or slightly numb. Stiffness in arm and intense heat at injection site makes it uncomfortable to move or use arm. Cold tingling sensation on occasion and stiffness in elbow joint. Slight dizziness and fatigue follow with pain in arm. Was informed to see a physician on Jan 6th, 2021 who said to fill out vaccination adverse event report and to keep an eye on arm. If pain or symptoms become worse to return.

                                                Got menstrual cycle like almost two and a half weeks early; Abdominal pain radiating to upper and middle back; Abdominal pain radiating to upper and middle back; Stomach cramps; Nausea; Fatigue; Headache; Sinus infection; The initial case was missing the following minimum criteria: Unspecified AE. Upon receipt of follow-up information on (04Jan2021), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 32-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital.  Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome.  Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA), famotidine (PEPCID), ethinylestradiol, norgestimate (CILIQUE) for birth control and multivitamin. It was stated that the patient got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. On 17Dec2020, she developed severe abdominal pain radiating to her upper and her middle back with pretty bad nausea, fatigue and headache. It was also mentioned that the patient had stomach cramps. These continued all the way until like Christmas. And then on the 19Dec2020, she actually got her menstrual cycle though she was not due to start that till that week. So, it came like almost two and a half weeks early (which was super weird as for her). The patient took ondansetron (ZOFRAN) for the nausea; aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide (MAALOX); famotidine and hyoscyamine for like stomach cramping. She also took that as well, acetaminophen (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen (MOTRIN). It was mentioned that the symptoms stopped on 26Dec2020 then she sinus infection right after in Dec 2020. Outcome of the event of sinus infection was unknown while the remaining events recovered on 26Dec2020. The patient stated that the she don&#39;t think that sinus infection was correlated at all but all other symptoms were happening right after the vaccine (reported as related).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event sinus infection is likely intercurrent and is unrelated to suspect drug BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I work as an occupational therapist in acute care. On 12/28, I was helping a patient transfer from supine to sit. She required maximal assistance, and I was briefly in an awkward position with my trunk flexed and rotated towards the right during this transfer. I felt a pull in my left lower back. After this, I iced the area and took 400 mg ibuprofen and this relieved the mild pain I had.  The following two days, I made an effort to follow back precautions (avoid bending, lifting, twisting), avoided heavy lifting at work. On 12/29 in the morning, I felt only a mild soreness in my left lower back and was able to go on my workday without issue (avoiding heavy lifting) On 12/29 around 3 pm I received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. On 12/30 (day off work) from the time I woke up until around early afternoon I felt a mild weakness and heaviness in both of my legs. It was most notable when I was standing to cook for about  20-30 minutes that my legs felt shaky and I felt the need to sit. I was able to finish cooking without sitting, however, this sensation was abnormal for me as I normally am on my feet for most of the day with an active job without feeling shaky or weak.  Around 22:00 on 12/30 I had severe nausea for about an hour or so. I can&#39;t fully remember, but several days after 12/28 or 12/29 I started to feel a mild cold sensation in my lower back. I attributed this potentially to my mild back injury, but it was unclear.  The sensory change was intermittent and mild, and ongoing until recently. On 1/9 while at work, I started to feel a mild cold sensation below my belly button, in addition to the intermittent lumbar back cold sensation area. On 1/11 at work, the sensory changes to my lower abdomen and back were more apparent after assisting in a maximal assist transfer with a patient.  At this time, it was a combination of cold and burning sensations.

With little relief from Imitrex (prescription medication for chronic migraines). Went to the emergency room Saturday for a shot of Torodal for the migraine to subside.

I just rested and felt better afterwards and it went away.

Around 2230 that night, I started having intermitted sharp pain in my leg arm pit. 0430 January 20th I woke up with sharp pains still in my left arm pit. By 1030 the pain was now constant and extreme.  I called my doctor and he told me to come into the office to see him. NP saw me and explained that the lymph nodes in my left arm were swollen.

                                                I received the first dose of vaccine on 12/17/20 with no symptoms initially other than soreness at injection site.  4-5 days post vaccine I began to have mild sinus drainage, headaches,  and backaches that I attributed to allergies, stress, and sinus issues.  On the evening of 12/23/20, I had lost my sense of smell completely and had diminished taste.  I was tested for COVID-19 around 0830 the next morning on 12/24/20 and was positive for the virus.  That day and the 7-8 days that followed I was extremely fatigued with muscle aches.  I continued to participate in the V-safe surveys and made note that I was having these symptoms likely because I was positive for COVID-19 (as of 12/24/20).  The CDC called and I relayed this information to them and it was decided that a report was not necessary.  After my second dose of vaccine on 01/07/21, I received another call from the CDC and it was recommended that I do file a report so data could be collected on those who have tested positive for COVID-19 after the initial vaccine.  I had no significant symptoms after my second vaccine and have presumably fully recovered from the virus to date.

No temperature. My body all around ached. My stomach was extremely upset. I had loose stools multiple times through out the day. When I tried to drink anything my stomach felt like it was also ?on fire? it was just not happy with anything being in there. Thursday same way. Headache, muscle aches, I am so tired. I feel drained of energy. My stomach is extremely upset. I have not ate anything since Tuesday afternoon. I have drank a lot of water. My body still ?aches? I have had loose stools.

It took hours just to get out of bed this morning, I felt so unwell.  I took 1000 mg of tylenol before bed on the day I received the vaccine (1/19), but I still woke up with fever. I continued to take 1000 mg throughout the day every 6 hours, which did help. Most symptoms resolved by 1/21 but I continue with fatigue and painful left axillary lymphadenopathy. The node is still really swollen and tender.

                                                4 hours after receiving vaccine, I was replacing a door handle, and thought I had moved my arm in such a way that it had subluxed at the GH joint. The acute, immediate pain in the joint and inability to move my shoulder were surprising. It took me a few minutes to realize this was likely a reaction to the shot. The joint pain migrated to my elbow, wrist, hand, and left side of my neck, and those joints were all cracking for about 2 days. My left shoulder is still experiencing discomfort and cracking frequently when I move that arm.

I lost my appetite  but wasn&#39;t vomiting or having nausea. I had a migraine and fever and body aches and chills (I was either freezing or hot) - couldn&#39;t get warm enough - these symptoms I noticed about midnight - it woke me up after a couple hours of sleep and then I couldn&#39;t sleep. These symptoms lasted through to Monday. Tuesday, I wasn&#39;t feeling fantastic but I went back to work. Fever broke on Sunday morning. Migraine lasted five days. I took Tylenol for fever and ibuprofen for other symptoms. I had a virtual Dr appt on Friday, the 8th. I took migraine medicine but it wasn&#39;t really helping. I met again with Dr on 11th - virtual. I chose to go back work even though I wasn&#39;t better - felt fatigue and the headache on and off for a couple of weeks. Just since the beginning of February do I feel like fatigue has gone away.  When I work out, I do still notice that I get tired faster.

                                                On Sunday, 2/21 both forearms, wrists, and thumbs began swelling and experiencing stiffness, tension, and pain (6/10) that was both burning/nerve pain and achy muscle pain. Previously, my DeQuervein&#39;s had been steadily improving through occupational therapy, home exercise, reduced tech use (scrolling/typing), and splinting.  By Tuesday, 2/23, range of motion on the Left hand, wrist, and thumb was reduced to almost 0 and the pain reached an steady 9/10 on both arms. As of writing this, the stiffness, swelling, nerve pain, and tension remain at a level higher than the initial level that drove me to seek out occupational therapy back in January.  Basically, I went from being close to being discharged to worse than I started. Overall the left side was worse than the right but both sides were impacted.  Occupational therapy (ultrasound, fascial release, and assisted stretching) splinting, stretches, and ice were used as treatments. NSAIDs are contraindicated due to Crohn&#39;s disease.   As of writing this at 16:04 on Thursday, 2/25 none of this has resolved. Pain is a 7/10 on both sides. Range of motion and ability to complete daily care tasks (e.g. dressing, showering, cooking and eating) is nonexistent to minimal.

                                                At the same day I felt my neck hurting all the way to my elbow. As the days progressed the pain got worse and I started feeling a bump on my neck. My whole left side from my neck to my elbow I would feel tremendous pain.  Days passed and nothing would get better so I spoke with my supervisor and she recommended me to go to the ER where they did some labs (blood work).  About 2 weeks later the pain in my left side subsided but the swelling on my neck and the &#34;bump&#34; never went away, although not painful. I received the second dose on 01/04/2021 and the same pain returned from my neck down to my elbow and the neck is swollen again and in pain. I decided not to go to the ER for the second dose and did not obtain medical help so far.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

                                                On Sun 12/27 around 12pm I had left arm tenderness and I was fatigued and then at 5pm I had a fever starting at 99.5 and by 11pm 103.5 I had body aches chills, rigers, fever did not break with tylenol or advil . I had the fever until Monday afternoon and it broke for a few hours and came back and did not budge from 101. I called occupational health and asked questions about my fever, monday night at 8pm I had a bad dry cough and SOB and chest tightness and sinus congestion, no sneezing or runny nose, still with a fever. I called occupational health again and they said to come in to get covid tested and results were positive Tuesday 29th AM. On Thursday I started taking medicine: 5 day course of singulair, slow vent albuterol prn teflex antibiotic and calcium, Zinc and  Vitamin D. The fever started to break around Monday the1st to the 4th around 99 to 100 . The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

Could not sleep because of chills. Next morning, developed severe legs pains and deep muscle pain - both legs - both calves, both sides. Resulted in me having to miss that day of work. I called my Dr&#39;s office and they advised to go to ER for severe leg pain. I didn&#39;t because I had a pharmacist that I work with who had advised me that I could wait. Similar symptoms to when I got COVID (on Dec 28th). Did have the same moderate arm pain in location of vaccine. Fever stayed above 100 for 48 hours. And the chills went away after 12 hours.  Around the clock Tylenol that stated when I got the vaccine - 1000 mg every six hours scheduled. Fever resolved after 2 days. Chills after 12 hours. Leg pain from severe on 15th - to moderate pain next day and on 18th the pain is more mild. Pain in legs haven&#39;t resolved entirely but much better.

                                                Starting several hours after getting the second vaccination I started to experience systemic myalgias, arthrias, and chills.  It got to the point where it was difficult to type.  I left work early that day.  The following morning, 01/14/21, I woke around 06:30 with searing, shooting pains systemically.  There were severe nausea, chills, and fatigue.  I was unable to get out of bed for the better half of the day and took a sick day.  I was able to go into work, 01/15/21, but continued to experience extreme fatigue, cognitive blunting, chills, arthralgias, and myalgias.  Over that weekend I slept 12&#43; hours each day and into MLK day, 01/18/21.  I went into work on 01/19/20 and continued to experience ongoing fatigue (difficult to walk from my office to the bathroom down the hall), chills, the nausea appeared to return, and intermittent chills/arthralgias/myalgias.  I spoke with the physician at the hospital and he directed me to get tested for COVID.  Details below.  This was on 01/19/21.  I continues to experience these symptoms throughout this week: 01/20-01/22/12.  The interval between the chills/arthralgias/myalgias is increasing but the nausea appears to be lingering.  Chills have basically resolved.

My temperature  was 102, then  my fever rose to 104.5 for most of the night. I did not sleep because my body was shaking and shivering. My body ached all over, especially my lower back. It felt like a very bad flu. My fever continued onto the next day and stayed around 103.7. I slept most of the day- had to call out of work. Tuesday morning my fever was gone and I went to work then went home because my fever spiked again to 101 about mid day. I slept all day and took Tylenol. By Wednesday my Fever was gone but I was still very lethargic. Thursday I felt fine.

I went to urgent care and told it was just muscle tension, but the pain was intense enough where I couldn?t go to work.  This was about 2 days after the first dose and lasted a few days before going away.   With the second dose I just received, it looks like my skin was scraped slightly. It burns.

This got progressively worse and peaked around 22-24 hrs after the vaccine where I had a 101.7 fever, headache, and higher degree of muscle achiness/weakness and fatigue. I took a ibuprofen and about an hour after that, the symptoms improved significantly. Aside from mild fatigue, the symptoms resolved fully by ~29 hours after I received the dose.

The next morning (1/21/21) noted quarter-sized red rash at injection site along with fatigue, whole body aches, that later progressed into headache, nausea and overall feeling unwell. That evening experienced chills. The following morning (1/22/21) injection site redness/rash was roughly 3in in diameter and warm to touch. Right front shoulder pain began and still continues 12 days post vaccine administration.

Very abnormal because I have the Nexplanon implanted in my arm and may have 2-3 periods per year. Normally the periods I do have are heavier and last 3-5days.  One week later I had about 3 days of left ovarian pain. Dose # 2- One day (which is today) after receiving my second vaccine I started with scant/ light vaginal bleeding and lower back pain. No ovarian pain yet.

After approx. 30 minutes of receiving my shot my left side of my face felt numb including the left side of my tounge as well as muscle pain and soreness on the left side on the back of my neck. Today is 3/5/2021, my face is slowly becoming less numb over time and rest. I also experienced fatigue and injection site soreness. I am particularly concerned about my face becoming numb shortly after receiving my vaccine and I am wondering if I should get a second dose when I need to?

After second dose of Pfizer, the swelling and pain in the neck escallated and three nodules were discovered in my neck at ER visit due to pain from neck and radiating in ears and head. Extremely fatigued and headache was unbearable. ER MD discovered nodules, high white blood count, etc. Sent to follow up with Endo. Endo could not explain. Thyroid labs are all normal but the symptoms and nodules makes this suspicious. ANother ER visit with 3 days hospitalization due to pain and now elevated pulse (even while sitting in ER bed at 135-140 pulse). Low grade fever, nausea, vomiting, lethargic, elevated labs, etc.  Now on propranolol for heart regulation and prednisone to monitor. Multiple CT scans and Ultrasound confirmed the nodules.

                                                I ultimately suffered from Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis and was hospitalized for 5 days due to brain and spine inflammation.  I had numbness in my feet 2 days after my vaccine, then suffered from dizziness and nausea 3 days after my vaccine, and had face paralysis 4 days after my vaccine. I went to the ER 4 days after the vaccine and was told I have Bell&#39;s Palsy and Vertigo. I was prescribed oral steroids and anti-nausea medicine. In the following weeks, I had more tingleness/numbness of the legs, brain fog and confusion, blurred vision, unsteady gait, loss of balance, blurred vision and leg muscle weakness, increased anxiety, hearing sensitivity, lethargy, sleeplessness, 6th cranial nerve palsy, tingles in the face, and headaches. I finally got an MRI and when doctor?s saw the MRI results 3 days later, I was told to go to the ER immediately because I had brain and spine inflammation that needed treatment, and was diagnosed with ADEM. I then spent 5 days in the hospital to receive intravenous steroids and monitoring. During this stay, I had more MRIs and a lumbar puncture. I was released on oral steroids for 25 days, as well as follow up appointments and monitoring progress in recovery. Inflammation has decreased. I continue to have tingleness in lower extremities, headaches, pain in legs, and sensitive hearing.

That night, I developed fevers that persisted for about 24h (spiked about 5 separate times - highest fever was 102). Then, on the third night after the vaccine (about 60 hours post vaccine), I had two separate episodes of night sweats (clothes were drenched, no fever). Later that night I had a bowel movement with bright red blood.  I then went to an urgent care where they drew labs, send a Covid swab, ordered stool studies, and ordered a CT abdomen.

                                                On Tuesday 12/28 I started to have severe leg pain in my right leg.  The next morning the pain was still in the right leg and had moved up through my right side in my joints to my knee, hip then went to the with shoulder down that arm.  My forearm became very painful on 12/30 and started to swell then radiated into my wrist joint and finger joints.  12/31 the pain continued in all those areas and had moved to my left side of my body starting with the left arm following the same course as the right side.  On 1/1 the pain has persisted and I am unable to perform any ADL&#39;s.  I saw an urgent care physician who told me to take ibuprofen.  I have been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol with no relief. Now all my joints are swelling in bilateral hands, wrist.  On 1/2 my bilateral ankle joints and feet started to have similar pain.  Know all my extremities are difficult to use and it is hard to walk due to the pain.  Because of the pain in my hands things feel heavier than what they should.  I am a medical provider and this almost seems like polyarthralgia rheumatica, I am going to go see a physician on Monday

My injection site (Left deltoid) was swollen and sore, although not more than usual after receiving a vaccine. I had no headache at all. The major concern was the fever and the backaches. I could not get warm, and I was shaking badly because I was so cold. I had ZERO relief despite taking 700 Mg of Tylenol. Side effects finally subsided after about 5 hours.

It lasted until about 24 hours after the vaccine. Over the last week, I?ve had horrible insomnia, waking up multiple times throughout the night with difficulty falling back asleep. I didn?t think much of it other than it?s very unlike me until a handful of other coworkers vaccinated around the same have also been experiencing this.

                                                Since the vaccine I have been having right sided hearing loss. Two days after my first dose I felt like I was underwater when talking to people, as their speech was distorted. I also felt pressure in my ear, as if it was filled with fluid, and was unable to &#34;pop&#34; my ears. I was evaluated by an ENT and there was no infection or fluid in my ear. It started to get better a little.  After my second dose, the symptoms worsen. My hearing loss was back worse than the original time and this time I had tinnitus constantly. I also had chills, fevers, myalgia, back pain, and headaches.

She had head to toe joint pain and rated this a 10. She also had had headache and extreme fatigue. She saw a physician and she was tested for Covid, strep and influenza, which were all negative. She was prescribed emergency steroids.   She did not miss any work because she was on scheduled PTO time. Saw her Rheumatologist ion 1/6 and her hydroxy-chloroquine dose was doubled. Still having fatigue, headaches and joint pains, which she said are not her usual Lupus symptoms. She saw her Rheumatologist again yesterday and he is recommending that she not receive the second vaccine dose.

This 34-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 at 08:00AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The first dose was received on 16Dec2020 at 7:40 AM at single dose. Vaccine location was in the left arm. The patient was vaccinated at hospital, age at vaccination was 34-years-old. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included ongoing fluticasone proprionate (FLONASE) for seasonal allergy taking for two years. On 17Dec2020, COVID-19 PCR test was negative.  On 04Jan2021 at night, she experienced myalgia, fever, chills, back pain and started with a constant ringing in her right ear and the hearing loss that worsened from before (started on 18Dec2020 after first dose, see AER # 2021012126). Start date of constant ringing in right ear was 05Jan2021. The events resulted in Physician Office visit. Hearing loss in right ear worsened and constant ringing in right ear were reported serious as medically significant while the other events were reported as non-serious. She went to see an ENT doctor and get a hearing test. The hearing test showed moderate hearing loss and speech clarity of 96% in her left ear compared to 52% in the right ear. They don&#39;t know if it is permanent. She is currently being treated with 80mg of Prednisone daily by mouth and getting dexamethasone injections to her middle eardrum. All of these effects have resolved except the hearing loss and ringing in her ear.   All the events were considered related to the vaccine per reporter.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 34-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number # EH9899) 16Dec2020 at 07:40AM in the left arm at single dose via intramuscular for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergy.  Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate  for seasonal allergy. The day after vaccination she noticed soreness of the left arm. Then two days later she noticed hearing loss secondary to a feeling of fullness in her ear; it felt like fluid in her right ear which has improved and she states it was not serious after the first dose. Patient received the second dose of vaccine on 04Jan2021 at 08:00AM in the left arm. That night she experienced myalgia, fever, chills, back pain, and started with a constant ringing in her right ear and the hearing loss that worsened from before (reported under AER 2021012152.

                                                After the vaccine was administered the patient sat in the waiting room for less than 5 minutes and then felt a fast HR, she felt hot and was worried that she was going to faint. She also felt shaking in her hands and her arms felt heavy.   She came back to the nurse that had administered her vaccine at 1:10pm where her oxygen level was monitored and she was given a cold cloth and water to drink. This lasted for about 20 minutes. Her oxygen level was monitored (~97%), her BP was checked at 1:45pm and it was 125/90. Her hotness, elevated HR, and shakes went away. At 2:00pm her BP was checked again and it was 139/96 and then again at 2:05pm where it was 132/90.   The patient stated that she felt fine and normal by now and also said that she had a BP cuff at work and at home and said that she would monitor it. All 3 of 3 follow up options discussed with patient: virtual care, the CDC, and/or 911 depending on her condition. The patient left at 2:15pm and patient was called 1 hour later for follow up.  On the follow-up call the patient stated that she was feeling fine and that her BP was 126/90. She said she would continue to monitor her BP and follow-up with virtual health if it wasn&#39;t back to normal by tomorrow.

By 9am I started to feel muscle aches and sharp joint pain, as expected. By 1200 noon, the pain intensity was increasing, coming in waves, lasting 10-15 minutes. The pain waves were 10/10, very severe, and was causing me to shake, cry, and be unable to function or sleep. I was also very disoriented, but I think due to the pain. It was mildly relieved with ibuprofen/Tylenol alternating every 3hrs, but continued until 6pm. It began to subside at 6pm.  I am an RN, and sought the advice of my employee health nurse, who advised me to seek medical care if it continued through the night. The pain began to subside, so I did not. However, if a  non-healthcare person experiences that, they will think they are dying.

A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular on 05Jan2021 at 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Mild ADHD/ADD. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving vaccination, she was standing in the observation room (where they had all of them stay for at least 15 minutes to ensure no severe reactions) and experienced a sudden onset of vertigo, tunnel vision and pre-syncope. Her hands became cold and numb and she was trying to talk to another staff member who was arranging/scheduling her second vaccination dose at the same time when this event occurred, but it subsided quickly and she started to feel normal again. All these events occurred at 12:45 on 05Jan2021. She reported this event right away and they had her stay in the room longer. She was stable at that point but experienced these symptoms again but very mildly twice more while she walked back to her car to go home. Other side effects on 05Jan2021 that started in the evening and for the following 2-3 days included fatigue, sore arm, leg/thigh aching, sniffles/sore throat, brief dry cough and slight headache/neck ache. Very mild and tolerable symptoms. All events were reported as non-serious by reporter. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and the patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of all events was resolved in Jan2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Almost immediately, I felt a pain go down to my wrist and across my chest. We pulled into the waiting area and around five minutes after the injection the right side of my face went numb., the pain had left my arm and chest by the time.  The nurse reacted by calling the emergency room and sending me there.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I felt abdominal pain and felt like I was going to get diarrhea and I got really flushed; shaky; face red. They put ice on back of neck. Arm started to hurt. Took Tylenol and sat down. And felt better 15 minutes later. Intervention was ice on back of neck so I wouldn&#39;t faint and rest. Overnight, first night - chills. Woke up with a headache. Took ibuprofen and Tylenol and had body ache and joint pain, too. Five days consistently (positionally) - when I laid down I would get it for five days. I had the vertigo which started 2 days after vaccine. Had a migraine 7 days after vaccine and I had to miss work because it was so severe. Had a typical migraine. Had an aura and it was so bad I couldn&#39;t see to drive to work. I don&#39;t ever get vertigo with my migraines and so this was different. After 7 days all symptoms were resolved. I am currently breastfeeding.

                                                First day after, 23rd, arm was pretty sore. 24th it was fine. Going in to the 25th - getting difficult to walk; joints were very rigid. Both hips and both knees and ankles -whole lower body very rigid. Muscles were really tight and tense. It felt like all muscles were engaged stiff and wouldn&#39;t relax. Joints wouldn&#39;t bend (butt on down). I couldn&#39;t walk. During the day on 25th those symptoms still persisted but could walk a little - very challenging - couldn&#39;t ambulate well and it was painful to walk. Day of 26th and symptoms could still persisted and seemed like the morning wasn&#39;t as bad but by evening it was really bad again. I didn&#39;t equate it to the vaccine because on the 24th I felt fine. 28th I tried to work but left early to go to Dr because I had trouble walking that entire shift.  Dr ran tests - Lyme Disease and CBC and SED rate and Rapid Strep test and Antistreptolycin - if any antibody in body for strep; rheutomoid factor ; TSH; C reactive protein; Uric Acid; pathology for Lyme Serology  IG/IGG; ANA with Pathology - all was C reactive proteins was elevated - Put on Prednisone Pack and that made it better until most symptoms resolved and I felt like I could move again. I ran out on a Sunday and by Monday I back to not being able to move again. Got blood drawn Wednesday (Jan 6, 2021). And they rechecked CBC, SED rate; C reactive proteins and rheumotoid factor; CCP antibodies; and they did a comprehensive metabolic panel. And those were all normal except C reactive proteins was elevated but not as much as initial test. A week later added CK test - tested for muscle breakdown and that was normal  Jan 6, 2021 - meloxicam was prescribed and that managed most of my symptoms but I can only use Tylenol with and not Ibuprofen (which doesn&#39;t work as well).    Urgent care initially went to.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

                                                The evening of the day I got the shot, I began to get tired and started to have a sore arm.  Throughout the night, the arm soreness got worse and I got joint pain.  The whole next day, I experienced severe malaise, headache, chills, fever, and joint pain with the site soreness.    The arm pain got worse.  That night, I struggled to sleep.  The whole day after that, I had less malaise and the fever had gone down but the injection site reddened and grew even warmer and more tender.  That evening it was difficult to sleep as the soreness in my arm migrated to the shoulder, armpit and the right side of my chest, along where a bra band would go on the distal right side of the chest.  The next morning (today) the entire armpit area and upper distal right side of the chest were hot and tender.  This afternoon, I palpated the area and noticed at least one swollen lymph node.  My arm still hurts.

Gradually  felt it in my whole body by 8:30PM that night, next day I tried to go to work but I had to leave because of the intense numbness and tingling. I also developed left leg weakness and had to even pick up my leg to be able to walk. The NP at my neurologist office (talked over the phone) said it was a pseudo effect due to my MS. My symptoms are still intermittent up to my second dose.  It is all over the numbness and tingling, but as it is subsiding it is now flaring up my symptoms from 2 years ago and I feel it on my second side.

Developed low grade temp, flushed face, fatigue, muscle stiffness, body aches hours following vaccine. Aches and fatigue continues and it?s now day 8. The fatigue is constant but comes in waves. I?m taking unexpected naps which are abnormal for me. Caffeine and methylphenidate are ineffective. I?m still sore. I also have brain fog, maybe from the fatigue. I can?t think straight and it takes me longer to process and do tasks. I woke up 2 hours ago and I can?t wait to sleep again.

                                                About 5 minutes after the vaccine, my tongue began tingling. I drank water but didn&#39;t tell anyone at the vaccine clinic. I did wait 17 minutes before leaving. I went to the car to look in the mirror and assess my oral airway. My tongue and pharynx were not swollen. I kept drinking water and proceeded to go home. About 10 minutes into my drive my throat became tight, so I went back and checked into the ER. My vitals were stable, and you couldn&#39;t see any swelling. My throat felt tight and my tongue tingly. I had already taken pepcid and zyrtec that morning, so they gave me Solumedrol and Benadryl IV. The tingling and tightness improved and went away by about 0930. It did return around 2300 that night (not as bad, just tongue tingly and slight tightening of my throat), and I took another pepcid and benadryl. I also had myalgias, felt febrile and fatigued for about 48 hours.  &#43;&#43;See previous VAERS report I did about vaccine #1

A 34-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ3247), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Jan2021 at 15:20 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included gestational diabetes (first pregnancy) from an unknown date to an unknown date and two pregnancies on unknown dates. Concomitant medications included unspecified post-natal multivitamins and paracetamol (TYLENOL; Lot Number: SBA22; Expiration Date: Jan2023) taken before getting the vaccine on 23Jan2021 to prevent soreness. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 03Jan2021 (at the age of 34-years-old; Lot Number: EL0142) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination (except the first dose). On 24Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient experienced chills and had a feeling like a heavy weight on her body. On 24Jan2021 at 07:00, the patient had a fever and headache. On 24Jan2021, she also had back pain. The clinical course was as follows: On 23Jan2021, the patient took paracetamol before getting the vaccine as she heard one can feel sore after getting it. The patient received the second dose on 23Jan2021 at 15:20. The patient was okay after she got the vaccine. However, early the next morning (24Jan2021), she had shivering without any fever (later referred to as chills). The chills were something she never experienced in her life. It was like she was in the cold. She could not move, it was that bad. She felt a heavy weight on her whole body. She could not get out of bed.  A few hours later at 07:00, she checked her temperature and it was 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She took paracetamol. The headache started with the fever around 07:00. She stated she kept taking paracetamol. She did try to stop using paracetamol, but without it, the headache was still there. The back pain was also severe on 25Jan2021. The chills recovered on 25Jan2021 and the fever was recovered on 26Jan2021. The clinical outcomes of the headache and felt like a heavy weight on the body were unknown; while that of the back pain was not recovered. The events of chills, fever, headache, and back pain were reported as serious by the patient (nurse) for being medically significant. The patient (nurse) assessed the events of chills, fever, headache, back pain, and felt like a heavy weight on her body were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known BNT162B2 vaccine safety profile causality between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

Injection site arm pain and stiffness was noticeable by 12pm, and gradually worsened to incredibly painful by 8 pm, especially in muscles between left  shoulder blade and spine. Chills began around 9:30pm at which point I took one 500mg Tylenol and went to sleep. I woke up with severe chills around 1:45 am and pushed off taking more 500mg Tylenol until 2:45 am. Afterwards I began to feel heartburn and slight nausea but was able to fall back to sleep. I woke up around 3:45 am to vomit. Afterwards, the nausea subsided and I was able to go back to sleep until 6:45am. I woke up with a headache which got worse and I took one Aleve at 9 am. By late afternoon I was feeling much better.

                                                On Saturday morning I woke up with a headache and swollen lymph nodes in my neck/collarbone area. As the day progressed, I began to have pain in my joints and muscles. I felt very tired all day as well. I also experienced skin sensitivity which basically just made my skin hurt if anything/one touched me. Sunday my headache persisted, still had pain at injection site and felt warm to the touch. Swollen lymph nodes also still there and fatigue. Monday morning symptoms of headache, injection site pain and warmth and swollen lymph nodes still felt.  Taking Tylenol to help with headache, warm compresses to help swollen lymph nodes and ice pack for injection site pain.

A 34-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration, on the left arm, on 20Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included sinusitis, placenta accreta, infertility, caesarean section, seasonal allergy, sulfa allergy, and coriander allergy all from an unknown date. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included prednisone from an unspecified date. The patient previously took hydrocodone and experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL1284) on 30Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced left arm completely numb and tingling for 4 weeks. No other vaccines were given in four weeks. On an unspecified date after the second shot, it was reported that the patient experienced elevated BP of 166/99, nausea, heart palpitations HR 111, sweating, muscle cramps, swollen lymph nodes, dizzy, body weakness, fatigue, pain moving across the neck/chest/back, trouble sleeping, and pressure in chest. On 30Jan2021, 10 days after the second vaccination, the patient experienced splotchy skin. The events resulted in doctor clinic visit and emergency room care. The patient was given an unspecified treatment for the events. The patient was tested for COVID-19 post vaccination via nasal swab on 26Jan2021 with a negative result. The vaccine was administered in the workplace clinic. The outcome of the events were reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported elevated blood pressure cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

All of these symptoms started around 4:30PM. As of this report, headache, muscle weakness, and fatigue have resolved. Still have some neck tension (though that is common for me as I work at a computer), and injection site muscle pain is much improved but still noticeable when I move my arm or touch the site.

                                                First vaccine I could feel the vaccine go into my body and down into my legs. It was a very strange sensation. I felt very fatigued 30 min after the vaccine but ignored it because it was not normal to have symptoms after the first vaccine. That night i did feel a litlle bit of swelling in my lips that continued into the next day but it was not severe. The muscle aches, joint pain and allodynia the 2nd day were so severe I don&#39;t really remember any other symptoms i may have had. I took Benadryl and Tylenol and slept for 2 days straight. After the 1st vaccine I did have shortness of breath for about 3 days post. Then I received the 2nd vaccine, I did not feel it go in this time. About 30 min after the second vaccine I felt very fatigued. About an hour later I started to feel slight swelling in my lips that increased and around 2 1/2 hours my eyes and lips were noticeably swollen and I was flushed. My husband noticed my ears and cheeks were bright red.   I felt my heart racing and took my pulse it was around 120. I felt dizzy and like there was a lump in my throat.   I requested an appointment via video call from  the emergency line.  I  didn&#39;t feel like I was having trouble breathing and stayed calm, my pulse went down to 100 after about 20 min. while waiting for my video call. I spoke to the doctor and they recommended going to the ER. I asked since the pulse went down and it felt like I was slowly reacting, if I could try taking Benadryl and see how I felt. She said that was ok but if I felt any difficulty breathing to go to  the ER right away. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and felt better and rested. The next morning lips and eyes were swollen again but a little worse. Difficulty swallowing persisted as well as severe muscle pain, joint pain, and allodynia.  The symptoms were worse with 2nd vaccine. Noticed shortness of breath just walking up and down steps. These symptoms lasted a little bit longer.  4 days after the vaccine I noticed  the lip swelling was not getting better so I called my PCP. He recommended taking the next 2 days off , rest with benadryl and tylenol. I listened and felt good enough to go into work. It is now 4 weeks since i had the vaccine and i am still experiencing  some symptoms that seem to be in relation to after i eat. That includes lip swelling, tightness in the muscles around my throat (feel as if they are strained), stomach burning, indigestion, heartburn.  Called PCP again who recommended I see an allergist/immunologist.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included endometriosis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on Tuesday (unspecified date). She thought she felt muscle spasms in the vaccinated arm, it felt like it was matching her heart rate. Her heart rate in the vaccinated arm had a mark for arrhythmia. She spoke to a family member who is a medical student, he thought it was caused by pressure on the vessel or pressure on the area. She reported having a rare form of microscopic endometriosis. She also read in a magazine that there were 36 cases of severe reactions after receiving the COVID vaccine. Not sure if it was the Pfizer COVID vaccine, but in one case, a female had heavy vaginal bleeding and her obstetrician found that she had 0 platelets although the week before her platelet count was normal. On 19Mar2021, when probed for the side effects experienced, consumer stated, &#34;Yesterday there was some aching in the arm but I thought perhaps the stiffness is going to be, the onset of stiffness is going to start but it didn&#39;t start as stiffness it just started progression to muscle out what I thought, muscle spasm. If I put my arm bended towards my chest that&#39;s when I would feel sort of a pop or some type of spasm and I drop my arm just like shake it off that would stop the static. When I work at my desk I keep my arm folded and today this morning is when I started to feel that the spasm in my fore arm sort of matched my heart rate a little bit and I thought do I feel my heart rate in my arm I thought that was impossible but apparently you can. I have a blood pressure check machine just to make sure I don&#39;t have high blood pressure which I have never had but I just in case you just want to check your &#39;vital signs&#39;. I put that on, it also checks &#39;report&#39; and your heart rate. I put it on my right arm which was the non-vaccinated arm because I didn&#39;t want to irritate inflammation in the vaccinated arm. When I put it my right arm my &#39;signs&#39; they were perfectly fine and it was 118 over 66 and pulse rate 85 but I thought, you know I really need to check the arm that I felt the, that was vaccinated but I actually felt the heart beating through the arm &#39;is due to&#39; muscle spasm so I put the device on that arm that was vaccinated, my left arm and when the results stopped it was completed, it was 107 over 68, 81 Pulse but then it had the notation that I had arrhythmia, I thought that here must be the heart , I don&#39;t know if it was skipping and so I thought it is a perhaps a blood clot matter but I keeping think what Pfizer had blood clot side effects so that&#39;s where I started to check and when I started to check on maybe compression or maybe inflammation I didn&#39;t want to assume blood clot so I checked for inflammation and compression. My sister&#39;s husband is a doctor, he said it sounds like Thoracic outlet syndrome and that compression but then there is like the &#39;veins&#39; one which is the blood clot, then I thought man that does sound like what I have but the fact that it was involved with blood clot but let me check to see if Pfizer did have a blood issue or a blood clot matter, that&#39;s when I thought those rare side effects. I have Endometriosis (History) but I have rare type of Endometriosis that&#39;s called microscopic (not spelled) and so it travels throughout head to toe of my body and always triggers some sort of inflammatory problem that mimic other type of condition, either trigger finger arthritis and then I don&#39;t get also sensation and then it&#39;s ruled out and then I don&#39;t have it back but it mimics something that&#39;s different and that&#39;s what I am little concerned because if the vaccine attacks right there.&#34; For treatment, consumer stated, &#34;I did immediately because I have heavy blood flow with Endometriosis, it&#39;s little bit frightening that the vaccine could be taking out my platelets and if I start bleeding I may just end up hemorrhaging and I went to online because the fastest thing to do on weekend, it&#39;s doing online when I did quick diagnostic to do the complete blood count to check my platelet numbers are okay so I just ran to the store that has a blood diagnostic and they were closing so I explained to them my concern about maybe having ITP and they could be attacking my platelets and if they could just you know stumbles it  later and draw the blood they did so I am waiting that may take a day to receive the results.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 118 over 66 and 107 over 68, full blood count: result unknown, heart rate: 85 and 81, SARS-COV-2 test: unknown result and weight: i think i am now 190 on unspecified dates. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 34-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Jan2021 13:00 (Lot Number: EL3246) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation at age 34 years old. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. No concomitant medications. No other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (lot no: EJ1685) for COVID-19 immunization at 34 years old. After receiving the second dose of Pfizer vaccine on 08Jan2021, within 13 hours (09Jan2021 02:00) the patient was ill with flu like symptoms (woke up freezing, headache, neck pain, body aches, restless). Later that morning (09Jan2021), the patient had nausea, vomiting and fatigue. After 36 hours (09Jan2021), profound fatigue, intermittently dizzy, felt feverish but did not confirm; body aches had resolved. On 10Jan2021 01:00, slept most of the day and night, had a few scattered hives in the evening. On day 3 (11Jan2021), since this day the patient has had constant vertigo. She was hospitalized from 15Jan2021 to 16Jan2021, had extensive testing and saw different specialists, and was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis secondary to the vaccine. She never had CoVID before, healthy otherwise, and had negative CoVID antibody testing prior to receiving the vaccine. She was off work for 6 weeks, able to go back for 10 shifts but had worsening of vertigo symptoms and was unable to work x 3 weeks and ongoing; still working with vestibular rehab, still having daily significant vertigo. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, disability or permanent damage. Treatment received included medication and vestibular therapy. The patient underwent covid test (nasal swab) on 16Jan2021 with negative result. The patient recovered from body aches on an unspecified date in Jan2021; while not recovered from the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible drug-event temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect product bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be excluded. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Tiredness has appeared to come and go over the last few days.  Every morning I have woken up with tingling in my left hand, as though there are pins and needles in my left hand.  My left arm feels weaker and feels some numbness when more pressure is placed on it.  I have a bruise that appeared above my left wrist.  I have reached out, as this is my employer and I have not heard back.  Assuming they were closed due to New Year?s Day.

                                                1. Noticing a sharp headache for about 10 seconds either in the occipital lobe region or temporal lobe region on the right side of my head every now and then. It has happened about 8 times since vaccine administration. The first time being about 25-30 minutes after vaccination. 2. I have also noticed a sharp pain in the back of my right thigh/upper buttock region that feels either like a nerve or muscle pain. It usually is most noticeable when I first stand up from a sitting position or laying position. If I don&#39;t put as much pressure on the heel of my right foot, it isn&#39;t as bad and ibuprofen has helped the pain subside, but it has been constant. This was first noticed about 4-5 hours after vaccination received.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5703), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 15Dec2020 17:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Administration was done in the hospital. Medical history included seronegative rheumatoid arthritis and allergies to latex and actemra. Concomitant medication included tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ), and ibuprofen. Eight days after vaccination, on 23Dec2020 at 13:30, the patient came down with fever, chills, body aches, joint pain. The patient was initially tested negative for COVID (nasal swab) and influenza on 27Dec2020 but did test positive for COVID-19 on 29Dec2020 (nasal swab). The patient stated that she knew that the vaccine did not cause COVID however as she was on immunosuppressants (Xeljanz), she wanted to record this information. There was no treatment included for the events. The outcome of the events was recovering. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                About 40 minutes after my vaccine, I felt sudden onset progressive weakness of my entire left arm with spasms/fasciculations of my forearm and hand  (while driving from hospital where I work as a physician to where I live). I pulled over, felt a bit dazed and was unable to use my left hand purposefully to call 911 on my cell phone, but was able to call 911 on my Watch using my right (dominant) hand. While talking to the dispatcher, my symptoms resolved (total duration a few minutes)  so I requested that they not send an ambulance but instead felt well enough to drive to my hospital ED. I discussed my case with the triage RN and ED attending who felt my symptoms were related to the vaccine, with no further work up needed, given then my symptoms resolved. My vitals were stable in triage.  No chest pain or shortness of breath, with normal neurological function and sensation of my left arm.  Note: I was not officially checked in or seen as a patient.     Sudden onset weakness and spasms of left arm (side of vaccine administration) about 40 minutes after vaccine

                                                On 1/9/21 I slept fitfully, woke up in a cold sweat but had a normal temp of 38.4. I had a headache, body aches, and nausea also. This was approx 16 hours post dose. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and felt more able to do normal home activities but still tired with a sore arm. 4.5 hours post ibuprofen dose I again had muscle aches, headache, fatigue, and nausea. I also had chills and joint pain. I napped for an hour, took another 600mg ibuprofen, and then napped for another 2.5 hours. After that I felt better at 27 hours post dose but still achy and fatigued. These symptoms had mostly resolved by 31 hours post dose.

Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP and they said to call employee health.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site. The event swollen lymph nodes worsened. The outcome of &#34;injection site itched a little bit&#34; was unknown.   The reporter considered the events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were all related to the vaccine; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, chills, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, bone pain, headache, lymphadenopathy, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site pain, blood pressure decreased, tachycardia, grunting and vaccination site pruritus cannot be excluded.

However, on 1/7/21 and 1/8/21 I had pain in my right axilla that I attribute to lymphadenopathy. I did not treat any symptoms and they resolved on their own.

                                                12 hours post vaccine developed severe muscle and bone pain and a fever, took 1000 mg of Tylenol 17 hours post vaccine and the fever broke, but the pain persisted. Took Ibuprofen 20 hours post vaccine because I developed a severe headache in addition to nausea. Headache became less intense, but all other symptoms remained at the same intensity. I fell asleep and woke up with a 103F at 28 hours. Pain persisted as well. I went back to sleep and woke up at 7pm when the fever broke, I noticed all the other symptoms were gone except for some new neck pain. The neck pain could be related to how I slept though since it was new. I did not take any more medication and went back to bed later in the evening. I woke up at 4am, roughly 29 hours post vaccine, with a fever and didn&#39;t take my temperature, but did take 1000 mg Tylenol. It broke an hour later. I have had waves of symptoms of a low grade fever all day (slight chills), which then feels like it breaks on its own indicated by sweat and chills disappearing. I haven&#39;t had to medicate any further however and in comparison to yesterday I feel amazing!

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

                                                The day of the vaccine (01/22) I had very mild soreness in my left arm. That night my submandibular lymph nodes were swollen. The following day (01/23) I felt tired throughout the day. I went to work and when I got home my whole body began to ache (especially my legs) and my lymph nodes were swollen again. This morning (01/24) I woke up physically feeling warm but I was heat seeking and had a fever of 100.8F and was dizzy. Currently my temperature is 98.6 and aside from a mild headache and a very sore left arm/axillary area I feel better.

Aching has been ongoing and intermittent.  1/17/21 Developed left ear &#34;fullness&#34;.  On 1/20/21 went to GYN for exam, explained left underarm pain, told that my breast exam appeared normal, but she questioned if my left ear fullness and left under arm pain were related.  1/21/21 Left Ear &#34;fullness&#34; began to radiated causing left temporal pressure, spreading across forehead.  Pressure developed behind both eyes.  Sudden onset of dizziness occurred.  Went to urgent care where they said I had swollen lymph nodes and believed I was having a auto immune response to something.  Told I received the vaccine on 1/7/21, they said the symptoms could be related to the vaccine.  1/22/21 Notice I would occasionally feel like I had a &#34;lump or pressure&#34; to the side of my throat.   As of present I am continuing to have Left  Ear &#34;fullness&#34;, left underarm aching, and bilateral eye pressure has bee intermittent yet ongoing.

Morning  temperatures were 100.0 F, 99.7 F and 100.4 F and by the afternoon they were elevated to 101.2, 101.4 and 101.5.  Ibuprofen was then taken to bring down the fever and for comfort. Fever controlled well with ibuprofen.  Fatigue, headache, muscle pain and chills started about 12 hours after the vaccine was administered and persisted past 24 hours after the vaccine was administered (still present as I am filling out this form).

                                                After 24 hours of receiving vaccine, I started getting numbness in my left arm (arm that received injection). Numbness felt like it was beginning from my elbow and going down to my fingertips. My left hand was noticeably colder than my right hand. 48 hours after injection, I started getting numbness in my left leg. Starting from my knee, down to my toes. My left foot was noticeably colder than my right foot. Both my elbow and knee feel swollen even though they don&#39;t look swollen. I tend to lay on my right side at night so I don&#39;t think I slept on it wrong. I get the numbness and tingling feeling randomly regardless of standing, sitting or laying down. It doesn&#39;t hurt but feels very uncomfortable. 48 hours after injection I felt nauseated, and felt like I had muscle weakness in both arms. I was extremely tired. I did have to take a child to the ER on the same day I received the vaccine (for a gastrointestinal virus that lead to dehydration). My 14 month old ended up with the same virus (uncontrolled nausea) two days later. I may have been fighting that virus even though I never threw up. No fever or redness at injection site. The numbness and tingling on my left side (including random spasms in my ribs) has continued for 96 hours since vaccine.

                                                I am a 35yo G2P1, was 29 weeks pregnant at the time of vaccination (due 3/25/21), completely normal pregnancy so far. CDC Vsafe called and asked me to report as an adverse event though I wouldn&#39;t consider more serious than most. Had low grade fever (99-100) on tylenol, chills, rigors, myalgias and joint pains starting about 12 hours after vaccination.  Went to work the following day (I am an physician) and by about 10 am had a presyncopal event and was unable to stand/continue working. Was unable to stand without feeling faint for about the next 6 hours.  Was febrile until about 8pm 1/9, never over 100 while taking tylenol. Symptoms completely resolved by 1/10 AM except fatigue for the next 4 days or so, though I developed axillary lymphadenophathy on the side of vaccination starting 1/12 for about 5 days.  No effect whatsoever on the fetus.

                                                I developed significant joint pain in my knees approximately 3 days after my second COVID19 vaccination. I have no history of joint pain and have no recent changes in my activity level or medical history. Even walking as a casual pace causes pain. It is not severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living, but it is certainly noticeable. I cannot think of any other potential cause of this pain. The it has been approximately 4 days since this pain began, and it has not improved.

Begun getting deep muscle cramps in my upper legs, calf?s and arms, still continuing off and on, little out of breath off and on. Went to the cardiologist for a check because of the water retention from the first vaccine and beginning again after second and he noted I had a little fluid at the bottom of my lungs. Swelling beginning to affect the lower legs again. Labs continued to being checked and continued doctor appointments.

There was light headed sensation w/ movement and position, pressure in my head felt like my head was going to explode and my eyes were burning.  Because so severe, I took 1000mg tylenol, lathered by entire body in eucalyptus oil and peppermint on my hands, I was able to fall asleep at 3am but it was restless sleep I kept waking up because any movement I made in bed I&#39;d have severe pain.  6am I felt moderately better all symptoms 50% improved, applied eucalyptus oil on again, started work at 730am I could barely function at work I have brain fog, just thinking focusing eyes concentrating makes migraine worse, &#43;photopphobia, phonophobia, just typing is very hard to do because it hurts my joints, the vertigo worsened and the slightest looking down to the keyboard while typing causes lightheaded sensation.  No improvement and it&#39;s now almost 1pm.  I didn&#39;t take any pain medication or apply any essential oils.

                                                I had a really sore arm for 4-5 days at the injection site.  I couldn&#39;t lift my injected arm over my head the next day after the injection due to stiffness and pain.  The pain improved over time.  I also had intermittent chills the evening after receiving the vaccine.  I had an episode of diaphoresis the next morning at work.  I checked my temperature when I was having chills and I had no fever.

                                                I got the shot on a Friday night at 5pm. I experience the arm pain in my left arm through out the top of my arm , by the end of  that night. By Saturday evening most of the pain was gone from that site. Late Saturday night I started noticing some pain in the arm pit on the left arm, didn&#39;t think much about it. By Sunday mid morning the pain was just getting more severe. Started to pay close attention to the side effects of the vaccine to realize that I most likely had swollen lymph nodes. The pain continued through the following Wednesday, when the pain started to not be as bad. I still to this day have some pain in the lymph nodes. I have contacted my doctor and was told to just monitor the site to make sure nothing is worse. That these reactions are common. I also have some soreness in my upper arm under where the shot was given, that I&#39;m not sure if it is from the shot or the muscle compensating from the soreness of the swollen lymph nodes.

                                                Received Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wed night 1/31/21 at 5:50pm. I had no prior recent illnesses prior to getting the shot. About 24 hours later, developed fevers/chills, body aches, headaches, and fatigue, and a notable pain in the front of neck -- felt like tender thyroid. Temp was 100.3F on Thursday night 1/14. Took ibuprofen and went to bed. Next day felt fine, went to work, but symptoms returned on Friday night without fever. Symptoms persisted through the weekend without fever until Sunday AM 1/17/21 at 3:40am, I woke up with a temp of 101.7F. Went to get tested for COVID on Sunday 1/17/21 and Tuesday 1/19/21. Both times were negative (both rapid and PCR). Remained febrile on Monday and Tuesday AM. Went to urgent care on Monday 1/18/21 and was negative for flu, but provider observed the thyroid was tender. TSH was checked on 1/18/21 and was abnormal, 0.027 and FT4 was 3.20. Had virtual appt with PCP on 1/19/21, and she ordered more blood tests to evaluate the hyperthyroidism. On 1/21, repeat TSH was 0.014, and FT4 and T3 were both high. Inflammatory markers were elevated, liver function tests were mildly elevated, but thyroid antibodies were all negative. Over the course of the week after getting the shot, I experienced tachycardia, palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion with simple tasks like walking up a flight of stairs or getting up from the couch to walk to the kitchen. PCP ordered an echocardiogram to evaluate the dyspnea on exertion, but it was normal. I had radioactive iodine uptake thyroid scan performed on 2/3 and 2/4, and it was notable for markedly low 24-hour uptake, consistent with Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, or other types of thyroiditis. As of 2/5/21, I am feeling significantly better from the past 3 weeks, and the hyperthyroid symptoms have improved and flu-like symptoms have resolved. Due to possible relation to the vaccine, I have delayed the 21-day booster shot to 23 days, and plan to get it this afternoon 2/5/21.

When I went fir 2nd shot I asked pharmacist administering shot abs he said last time they may have hit a nerve I had no other side affects so I got second dose.

Later that evening my injection site was sore, itchy, and raised, like a hive.  On 2/23/21 I woke up at about 7:30AM and the injection site was the same as before, but I also had a sore/stiff neck and headache at the base of my skull.  The reactions have not warranted a trip to the doctor, but I remember hearing somewhere that the CDC was interested to know about any side effects that may be related to the vaccine.

Some of the nerve pain has come and gone over the years, but this pain has lasted for 5 days and began less than 24 hours after receiving the COVID shot. The pain affects mostly trapezius and levator scapulae (underlying?) muscles on both left and right sides. It feels worse than the muscles aches of having the flu, but only in the neck area. I used Salonpas patches, took ibuprofen and rested.

A 35-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 14:30 (2:30 PM) at single dose on left deltoid for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type is hospital. No history of previous immunization and no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect, also reported as &#34;Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None&#34;. Medical history included ongoing Vitamin D deficiency for quite a few years.  Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) from Oct2020 and ongoing at 50000 IU gel cap, once weekly for Vitamin D deficiency. Patient is scheduled to receive the second dose of Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021 but reported side effects from her first shot including bruising near the injection site, shortness of breath, muscle tenderness and elevated heart rate (main concern). Upon contacting her HCP, she mentioned that this may be a side effect of her anxiety medications and asked &#34;Should she take the second dose?&#34;. Approximately 22hours (13Jan2021) after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. COVID-19 vaccine injection site became red, warm, and itchy, also experienced blood pressure increased, shortness of breath and Clammy, all on 13Jan2021. The patient was pale on 13Dec2020.

Patient became sweaty on 14Jan2021. It was further reported that patient received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021 2:30PM . She said after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine, she has had multiple symptoms. Patient is now due for her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose today 02Feb2021. Patient did not know if she should get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and if her side effects were from the first COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient works in a doctor&#39;s office where there is a medical doctor, nurse practitioner, and several other registered medical assistants. Approximately 12 hours later after vaccine, at 2:30AM (13Jan2021), her left arm was extremely sore. She said she went to work on Wednesday, 13Jan2021, and her left arm was still really sore, but she was fine, otherwise. She said approximately 22 hours after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection site.

These started around 9pm on Thursday evening, and subsided by 6pm on Friday 3/26/21. On Saturday 3/27/21 I started to feel pain in my lower back. It wasn?t pain in the muscles it was itching of the skin that turned into a piercing pain that covered my lower back. I contacted my primary care and she said it sounded like shingles and asked if I had a rash. I did not. She started me on Gabapentin 300mg 1 capsule by mouth 3x a day as needed for pain. The symptoms lasted until approximately the evening of Tuesday 3/30/21. No rash ever appeared but the burning/itching/piercing pain is what stayed with me for those 3 days.

Started to have a hot flash on the way home.  Then her tongue felt sluggish but not swollen.  She had a few minutes having difficulty swallowing but denies a sensation of throat swelling.  Arm became sore and heavy but no redness.  Drove back to the hospital with the onset of these symptoms and waited in the parking lot for 15 minutes to see if the symptoms were going to progress but they didn&#39;t.  Stated she became very fatigues for a few hours but felt fine the next day except for a sore arm.

                                                On 1/6 at approximately 9am hour, I noticed joint pain in my fingers while typing, muscle soreness in my upper back, a headache, and a slightly sore throat. It quickly went down hill with a fever, chills, worsening joint and muscle pain everywhere, nausea, severe fatigue, worsening sore throat, tingling and numbness in all extremities at random locations. It is now 3pm, about 21 hours since vaccination-fever has broken once (I took ibuprofen at 2pm) but returned but not as high, and severe headache with light sensitivity. The joint pain and numbness has faded but I am left with severe muscle soreness, like I was in a car accident. Oh and I lost taste sometime today. Also I had injection site pain for both doses, starting the morning after.

                                                Probably with in 30 sec of the vaccine being administered I started to not feel well. Felt like it spread through my body,  I felt a weird feeling in my chest, throat, my legs felt weak, I was light headed and my heart started to beat hard and fast. It then started to subside over several minutes. The nurse kept me for 30 minutes and then I felt ok to walk out. I had a bit of a headache and didn?t feel right the rest of the night.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EL1284, expiry date not provided) on 23Dec2020 09:15 intramuscularly in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as preventive). There was no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The nurse (patient) received her first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at the hospital that she worked at. She was kept there for 15 min for monitoring and she felt fine. About 30 minutes post vaccination she got a hot flash, a flush over her face, she does not know if she was red but she felt flush. Her tongue felt strange, nothing swelled that she could tell, it felt hard to swallow, to make the motion to swallow it felt kind of sluggish. She felt weird swallowing which lasted for only a few minutes. She never struggled to breathe. She went back to park in the hospital parking lot since she was not sure if she was experiencing a anaphylactic reaction and then after a few minutes it went away. Her arm was sore and heavy feeling for that day. She had drowsiness for a couple of hours and pain and redness at the injection site for a couple of days that was not bothersome, it was mild. No relevant test. She wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine due to the symptoms she had after the first dose. The pain and redness at injection site was resolved on an unspecified date in Dec2020, while the other events were resolved on 23Dec2020.  The reporting nurse considered the events hot flash, flush all over her face, arm was sore and heavy, drowsiness, pain and redness at injection site were non-serious, while the events &#34;tongue felt strange, it was sluggish to swallow&#34; were serious that she drove back to the hospital (no emergency room/phycian office visit). She considered the events were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162Bw on the reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I found it difficult to ambulate and lift my arm at all. This was followed by malaise, weakness, and fatigue. The decreased strength and sensation on the left side of my body lasted for several hours, gradually fading around 4am. The weakness of the left side of the body improved over time and I was just left with fatigue and malaise.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

Horrible headache that did improve with tylenol and ibuprofen taken at the same time. Body shakes and can&#39;t control body temperature.  Felt freezing cold but skin was very hot to the touch (according to my husband). Then, I started sweating and felt really hot and couldn&#39;t cool down.  Felt nauseous but no vomiting.    Could not sleep but felt very tired.  Today is now 48 hours after vaccine and body aches are gone but I am still extremely fatigued.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EK5730), via intramuscular in left deltoid  on 21Dec2020 10:00 at 0.3 ml, single for precaution as front line healthcare worker in hospital which is not a military facility.  Medical history included nonsmoker. She did not provide causality but stated that she probably already had COVID when she got the vaccine. It was unknown if the patient had SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis as she had never been tested. Other history was none. The patient did not have a history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease, cancer, immunosuppressive disorder, obesity. There was not any pre-existing diseases worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection. The patient hadn&#39;t been treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. Concomitant medication included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN SR), sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL). Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were none. AE following prior vaccinations were none. There was no additional vaccines administered on Same Date (21Dec2020) of the Pfizer bnt162b2. The patient got the covid 19 vaccine on 21Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 24Dec2020. The patient wanted guidance on receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine. The reporter considered event was non-serious. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 21Dec2020, and after that on 24Dec2020, she tested positive for COVID . She was supposed to be revaccinated on 07Jan2021. She would like to know if she should she get this or does she need to be revaccinated. There is no prescriber. She received it through her work. She received the first dose on 21Dec2020, and assumed she was positive when she got it. She just had cough and muscle aches and a headache. Her dad was hospitalized. Hers was not that serious. She had not completely recovered yet. Her smell had not come back yet and she was just tired still. She said the headache was prior to getting vaccine. She did not provide causality but stated that she probably already had COVID when she got the vaccine. The cough occurred on 25Dec2020, muscle aches on 22Dec2020 at 08:00. There was no emergency room of or physician&#39;s office required for the events. The patient was not hospitalized or admitted to an ICU. Nasal swab test done. Imaging for COVID-Pneumonia, other radiological investigations, hematology, clinical chemistry, inflammatory markers, urinalysis, evidence of hypoxemia, other relevant test were none. The patient did not display clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow or ECMO) or receive mechanical ventilation. The patient did not receive any additional therapies for COVID-19. The event did not require the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure.  She did start taking extra vitamins on her own. The patient was recovered with some lasting effects such as not being able to smell and is tired still.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported COVID with symptoms and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, bnt162b2.  However, as the reporter claimed &#34;she probably already had COVID when she got the vaccine&#34;, this may provide  an alternative explanation.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 14Jan2021 18:25 at 0.3 mL, single for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Bactrim and experienced allergy. The patient reported she did develop some side effects, but the hospital she received the vaccine at didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. She reported that a minute or two minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (14Jan2021), her heart rate became very fast, it went into like the 150&#39;s. She started feeling jittery, lightheaded, and she had some weakness of her lower extremities. She also felt nauseated. She didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath; she thinks she was okay there. She clarified that she had her mask on and they told her to remove her mask and to breathe, breathe, breathe. She had a pulse oximeter on, and her levels were always at 98, 96. She was told to sit still, and she was given water. Her heart rate went down to 76. She was fine and then after 5 minutes, she had the same reaction again. Her heart rate this time was in the 120&#39;s. She was lightheaded, cold, jittery. She did the same thing again and waited another 5- 10 minute. She felt better but was still nauseated, lightheaded, and really, really cold. She was kept there for 45 minutes. After that, she still did not feel 100%. Currently, she still does not feel 100% well. She was okay, she thinks she was okay. She explains they wanted to send her to the ER (emergency room) but she declined. Her heart rate had improved, she wasn&#39;t feeling like she was going to pass out. She wasn&#39;t experiencing shortness of breath, she wasn&#39;t throwing up, she didn&#39;t have a rash, her throat wasn&#39;t closing up, so she went back to work. She further stated that she came back home. Her heart rate was a little faster, but it wasn&#39;t as high as it had been. She still felt a little bit of weakness. At night (14Jan2021), she probably had a fever, she doesn&#39;t know. She was really thirsty and very hot. Because she was not feeling well, she didn&#39;t get up and drink anything. This morning (15Jan2021), she feels a little better. If she is doing her normal activities, she does get tired. She feels like she is running and is like &#34;okay I feel tired&#34;. She has a little bit of weakness in her lower extremities. She was given information for reporting side effects, but because she wasn&#39;t feeling well, she didn&#39;t do any of it. She checked her heart rate today (15Jan2021) and it&#39;s at 76. She added that when she moves a lot, she feels tired and she doesn&#39;t know why. She&#39;s normally a very active person. She is no longer jittery, but still feels lightheaded. She has a little bit of nausea. She felt hungry so she made a shake and it&#39;s not like she is going to throw up, but she is still feeling yucky. She still has a little weakness of her lower extremities. They feel light, she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it. She is just a little bit concerned because this is a new vaccine. The outcome of event heart rate increased was recovering; outcome of event feeling jittery was recovered on an unspecified date; while the outcome of other events was unknown. The patient confirmed he doesn&#39;t believe it to be life threatening. She doesn&#39;t know if this is a severe allergic reaction. She was reading on the side effects the COVID-19 vaccine can cause. Per reporter all events were related to suspect product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the contribution of suspect BNT162b2 to the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday, January 20th at 1:15 PM. After I got the vaccine, I went in to the observation tent for observation. I sat down and immediately felt a tingle sensation in my fingers on my left hand and my arm hurt at the injection site on my left arm. After I left the observation and returned home, the rest of the day/night, my left arm hurt where I received the shot, I had a headache, my neck hurt, and I felt a little nauseous. The next day, January 21st, I felt a slight tingle sensation in both my hands and feet on my left and right side. January 22nd, the slight tingle sensation in both hands and feet on my left and right side continued, and I had a very bad headache. The slight tingle sensation has continued along with some muscle soreness in my arms and legs. The tingle sensation is intermittent throughout the day in my fingers and toes. I have no numbness and it is not painful. It is just a slight minor tingle sensation. I messaged my doctor on January 25th and was advised to monitor it and contact back if it doesn&#39;t go away. Present day January 30th, I still have slight tingling sensation in my fingers and toes on my left and right side, the muscle soreness has since subsided.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) , via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 23Dec2020 17:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient received the first Pfizer vaccine on 23Dec2020 at approximately 5:15 PM. The patient felt fine until about 11 PM at night, the patient stated, &#34;when I began experiencing intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; on 23Dec2020. I took a Benadryl and went to bed. At approximately 1 AM (24Dec2020) I woke up feeling like I was 500 lbs (I am about 175 lbs). I also had swollen lymph nodes in my neck, a stiff neck, a severely dry throat, and severe shivering. I attempted to navigate to the bathroom and felt like I needed assistance to walk safely to avoid falling. I felt like an impending sense of doom, and called my mom who is a nurse. She told me to contact the Pfizer #, but nobody was answering the phone at that time. I then started looking up on the internet if anyone else had experience what I was feeling after the vaccine and if the feeling passed, as I was not sure if I should go to the ER. I ended up falling asleep.&#34; The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient took Benadryl for events &#34;intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; as treatment. No treatment was given to the patient from the remaining events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

She screamed.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done. She also thought if she ever wanted to travel that she might need it. She thought in the long run she might benefit from having the vaccine. She felt peer pressured honestly to get it because she was sketched out to get it at all. She wants to know the rate of people testing positive for COVID after getting the vaccine. The outcome of the events sore arm, chest burning, joint and bone pain, skin even hurt to touch and sensitive was recovered on 15Jan2021, the outcome of the events screamed and couldn&#39;t walk was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovering.

A 36-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 20Jan2021 16:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot EH9899) on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. On 20Jan2021 the patient had headache with outcome of recovering, general malaise, muscle pain and muscle spasms in neck with outcome of not recovered, numbness in hand and arm with outcome of unknown. On 21Jan2021 the patient experienced chills with outcome of recovered in Jan2021 and fever with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, neck was very stiff, skin irritation, like achiness from wearing clothes with outcome of unknown. The patient experienced also exhausted, pain, on Jan2021 with outcome of unknown and high blood pressure (she was normally 105/60, and in the ER she was 170/101) on 23Jan2021 with outcome of unknown. Clinical course was as follows. The patient began to develop the following symptoms: headache, numbness in hand and arm, and muscle spasm in neck. The patient was working and had some patients the day following vaccination, and her headache got much worse, the muscle spasms and pain were worse, and all of a sudden she got skin irritation, like achiness from wearing clothes, and she realized she had a bit of a fever. Chills have gone away, she did not feel those. Muscle aches, especially the muscle spasms on her neck into the shoulder have not. Fever went away that day, she took Tylenol, and after she took it, she got home from work, and was better that evening from chills and fever, she has recovered completely from fever. She was in so much pain, she was feeling overall exhausted. She had headaches the day of the injection. She thought she had slept wrong, possibly the night before, so she didn&#39;t think of it, until symptoms worsened. She went to emergency room on 23Jan2021 due to severity of the muscle spasms in neck, so the doctor was worried about stenosis, or like impingement of spinal cord, but the CT scan on 23Jan2021 was negative for structural reasons, so she was prescribed a muscle relaxer and one for pain and inflammation. The patient was given Tramadol and Norophlex at the ER via injection in each arm. After receiving injections she reported that she developed a severe reaction in both arms, she cannot move her arms, it was extremely painful, like she had surgery on both sides and her neck was very stiff. Her arms were now weak, very painful, and she could not lift her arms. She has had Tramadol in the past, never had pain, but this was worse than labor. Her left arm felt like it would explode when he injected it, and now she can barely move both arms, she has not been able to move her arms, and the hospital doesn&#39;t know why, this is not a response from those medications. Headaches were the same intensity, but better from when she went to the ER. They were now a 7 out of 10 and in the ER were a 10 out of 10. When she got chills, she had an intense stiffness in her neck, muscle pain across shoulders to upper back, and it varies in intensity, she&#39;s been laying down the last day and a half, today was tolerable, but when she went to the ER on Saturday, it was so extreme she thought she had a nervous breakdown, it was a lot of pain, she didn&#39;t know if that contributed to her elevated blood pressure, or was something separate.

Nothing in the right armpit. I also had aggressive itching at the injection site and a hard area and red welt.

                                                Starting the night of vaccine - had a headache about 8PM in evening .I woke up feeling weird throughout the morning: fatigue - didn&#39;t want to move at all but not moving wasn&#39;t comfortable; fever, chills, joint and muscle aches - mostly in my back (I couldn&#39;t get comfortable) - felt like I had been  hit by semi truck. Very weak - if that was a 10th of what COVID felt like, I didn&#39;t want it! Those symptoms lasted about three to five days. By the5th day - I was mostly back to myself. I took Motrin - which helped slightly for headache.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot I suddenly felt like I was having an anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and a tingling adrenaline feeling started in my head and spread down through my body.  My throat felt strange, but I could still breathe.  It started to subside after a couple of minutes but didn?t resolve completely for another hour or so.  I also had a headache almost immediately.  In the days following the vaccine I had such sore muscles it was hard to get out of chair or go upstairs.  That lasted 3 days.   About one week after the shot I started noticing my brain felt glitchy.  At night I have not slept well since about one week after the vaccination  and  I frequently awaken feeling confused, stressed, and disoriented.  This is not normal for me.    Additionally, about 3 weeks after the vaccine I had another mild panic attack.  I have not been troubled by panic attacks before getting the vaccine.  As of today I am starting to feel less glitchy in my thinking. I am still not sleeping soundly and waking often, sometimes accompanied with confusion.

                                                I had my first COVID vaccine on 1/16/21. I had my second one on 2/5/21. On 2/9/21 I started experiencing a sharp pain in my left breast. On 2/10/21 I had sharp pain in between my shoulder blades. On 2/11/21 I noticed a small red rash-like spot in between my breast. I woke up on 2/12/21 in incredible pain on my back, so I lifted my shirt to look in the mirror and that is when I noticed a blister type rash from the middle of my back wrapping around the front of my body covering my left breast. I went to see the PA at my PCP&#39;s office. She diagnosed me with shingles. She placed me on an anti-viral medication for a week, and gabapentin (nerve medication) for a month. It has been 3 weeks today since I first began treatment and I have not fully recovered yet. My blisters dried up about a week ago, but ever since then I have been incredibly itchy, which has kept me up every night for over a week now. On 3/3/21 I called my PCP&#39;s office and they started me on Prednisone for 6 days. I am 2 days into treatment and I still have not had relief from the itching.

A 36-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6208) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 21Mar2021 14:45 (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included epilepsy and asthma. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included levetiracetam. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6203) administered in left arm on 28Feb2021 14:30 (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had the normal yet severe side effects of sore arm &amp; neck, stiffness behind the ear, stiffness of the neck and injection site arm, fatigue, fever, headache, sore throat, chills, for the first few days her 2nd dose. But on day 2, she started suffering from tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, confusion in both ears and increased seizure activity. The events started about 2 days after the second shot on 23Mar2021 12:00 PM; its been a week now and it still hasn&#39;t gotten better or gone away. She had an appointment with her pcp tomorrow but so far nothing has helped. Its debilitating and extremely hard to focus &amp; function. She mainly just wanted to know if any other vaccine trial participant/recipients have reported anything similar &amp; if so, how long can she expect this to last. The adverse events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was unknown if treatment was received for the events. No COVID prior vaccination. No COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

This increased to chills, a temp of 101f (baseline 97.8), and myalgias/fatigue so severe Going to the restroom felt like running a marathon (which I have done). I had to fully lay down and couldn?t carry my 15lb son. I also had marked breast tenderness greater on the side of the injection. My son seemed to have trouble staying latched (?due to tiredness from my direct warmth), and had increased fussiness.  I have never had more than a mild local injection reaction w tenderness with any other vaccine

                                                Parasthesias began in my lower extremities intermittently about 36 hours following administration. These spread to my upper extremities and became consistent. Occasionally will appear in lips and trunk. These are associated with sensation of numbness and some discomfort in my extremities. I&#39;m also experiencing significant brain fog, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Headaches are occurring about every other day.  Symptoms are present currently and have remained relatively consistent in severity.  Was evaluated by urgent care on December 28 and encouraged to observe. Was evaluated in the ER by neurology on January 4. There leading hypothesis is vaccine related immune response. Neurologic exam was largely normal, being evaluated by a specialist in the coming days.

At 0845, she came to me and reported that her shoulder was achy and the pain rated 4/10 was radiating to her back. I checked the injection site and arm and it was not red, raised, or warm. Pt did not have any other symptoms, just the achy shoulder. Pt also reported a brief burning sensation in her shoulder that subsided within 1 minute. She later felt that same sensation in her forearm and it also subsided. It was recommended that she go to the ED for monitoring since the pain was radiating further from her shoulder. ED RN took her in at 0905 and I left.

I took ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol and started to feel better.  I felt back to normal about 36 hours after receiving the vaccine.

At 2300,  I started to have fever/chills, up to 39 C orally. This only partially responded to Tylenol. I was not able to sleep.  At 2:30 am I noticed an unusual headache, 8/10, as well as bilateral eye pain on Moving eyes side to side as well as sensitivity to light. Headache was mostly frontal, which came and went every few minutes  until exactly 11:38 am on 1/14/2021, when the fever and myalgias very suddenly got significantly better. Almost exactly 24 hrs to the minute after injection. On 1/15/2021, I still have significant pain in my left arm, swelling, redness and, now, itching at the injection site. My lower back still hurts.

                                                Symptoms reported by patient  Received vaccine on 1/4/2021 @ 0950.  Vaccine was given on side of left arm.  On the evening of 1/5 I started to not feel well.  I had a runny nose, headache, nausea, and fatigue.  The injection site on my left arm was red, warm, and swollen with a knot/ball that could be felt underneath.  I also had moderate pain at injection site.  This was about the size of a half dollar.  On the morning of 1/6 I still didn&#39;t feel well.  I received a call from my mom that she tested positive for COVID and although I did not have much contact with her there was one day on 12/26 that I saw her outside for about 15 minutes (masked).  I called employee health with all of this as it was hard to separate the exposure from symptoms of the vaccine.   I did express some concerns over having a vaccine reaction but was told the symptoms I was having would be normal.  I was tested for COVID, which was negative.  Over the next few days symptoms got better but I did have nausea on and off until the morning of 1/11.  Redness at injection site, swelling and pain were resolved by 1/11 as well.  On Friday 1/15 I woke up and my injection site was red, warm, swollen, and had pain again.  This was about the size of a quarter.  There was also a hard area that could be felt under the skin.  My arm hurt with radiating pain into my wrist.  I thought maybe it was just random and it would go away.  It slowly resolved through out the day and was mostly gone by Saturday 1/16/21.  The only thing left was a faded red area about the size of a nickel.  Friday evening ,1/15, I started to not feel well with body aches, joint pain, headache, and pain from injection site that radiated to my chest (this was intermittent).  I also had a low grade fever (highest temp 99.9).  I still did not feel well on Sunday but some symptoms were improved (pain radiating to chest was better and no more fever) but still had fatigue and body aches.  I had a rapid COVID test done which was negative on the evening of 1/17/21.  On 1/18 I felt better but towards the end of the day started to feel fatigued with body aches and headache.  I contacted employee health for further follow-up.

                                                I developed the expected side effects of fever, chills, and body aches.  The body aches were mostly in my neck and hips.  They slowly improved but lingered in my neck.  Then on Sunday 1/9 I developed severe 10/10 pain in my neck and shooting down my left arm and down my shoulders and back.  It was unrelieved by ibuprofen, norco, heat, essential oils, and changing of positions.  I was unable to sleep.  I went to my chiropractor and she was unable to adjust me due to severe pain.  She applied icy hot, did some gentle massage, and gave me curcumin for the inflammation . She believed it was an inflammatory response in my cervical spine.  It slowly improved to a 8/10 pain, but I was still unable to sleep laying down. I was unable to work for 3 schedule shifts.   I saw my chiropractor 4 times total that week. On 1/16 I went to urgent care because the pain was not getting better.  She said I had torticollis and gave me naproxen and a stretching exercise.  It is still lingering muscle pain, but I am able to finally sleep and function normally.   I had never experienced pain like that before and I hope I never do again.

A 37-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot # EJ1685) at single dose at left arm on 02Jan2021 11:45 for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety. No allergies to medications, food, or other products. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient has received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 03Jan2021 the patient has been tested for COVID-19 with rapid nasal swab test resulted positive. It was unknown if treatment was received. The outcome of events was unknown. Later the patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot # EL0140) at single dose at left arm on 23Jan2021 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at Pharmacy or drug store. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications in 2 weeks of this vaccination included: Lamictal, Klonopin, multivitamins, D, C, B, Zinc. On 24Jan2021 12:00 AM the patient experienced extreme tiredness, chills, fever, muscle aches, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, pale skin, malaise, night sweats. No treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag. Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use. Further information like confirmative COVID 19 nucleic acid/ PCR test together with any associated symptoms are needed for full medical assessment.

                                                I received my second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 01-13-2021 at 8:30am in my left upper arm.  By 3pm that day, my left arm was very tender to the point I couldn?t lift it up and I began having whole body chills and shivering along with extreme fatigue. I went to bed at 5:30pm that night and woke up around 11:30pm to my whole body shaking and shivering and my teeth where chattering together. My husband said I was confused at that time and kept repeating that I was freezing. I must have had 5 blankets piled on top of me to try to get me to warm up.  By the next morning, I soaked through the bedsheets and had extreme fatigue (like I had a hard time keeping my eyes open) all over body aches, fever and chills.  I remained this way for the next week.  At the end of the 1st week I still had chills, extreme fatigue, nausea and horrible headaches and my left arm pain turned into left elbow joint pain. By the end of the 2nd week, I still had extreme fatigue, headaches and left elbow pain along with body tremors. On 1-28-2021, I went to the hospital due to having two episodes where I felt so dizzy I had to lay down on the ground until the dizzy spells subsided. I was given IV fluids and sent home with orders to rest. By the end of the 3rd week I no longer had body tremors or dizzy spells but I still had extreme fatigue needing multiple naps a day along with headaches at which time my primary doctor prescribed me Imitrex to help alleviate the headaches and I still had left elbow joint pain. I also developed bronchitis. It is now February 25, 2021 and I am still having fatigue and mild to moderate headaches along with the left elbow joint pain along with some right elbow joint pain. I have been out of work for over a month now due to my fatigue and joint pain.

They told me to continue taking Benadryl because the allergic reaction could resurface. cough is still present and I have body aches.

                                                I felt weak and with muscle fatigue the day after the shot. Also had a headache and neck muscle tension and mid back muscle tension. Joint pains as well. These subsided after 48 hours except for the neck and upper back muscle fatigue and mild soreness. This gave me a low grade headaches almost daily since the vaccine. I took ibuprofen a few times which helped. On the 6th I awoke at night and felt weak all over. I felt like I was falling in my bed. Mild dizziness.  I went to work and felt extremely fatigued with muscle weakness but no neuro deficits. I feared some terrible autoimmune illness and took Decadron that day- 4mg tab BID. This helped my muscle weakness but left me with insomnia. The decadron is now wearing off after 4 days and I still have muscle weakness/fatigue. It takes considerable effort walking up the stairs. Yesterday my masseter muscles became fatigued with little chewing. My arms feel heavy when I lift them. The strange thing is that at night when I lie down I feel like my sympathetic nervous system is being triggered. I will get palpitations and feel just strange- I can&#39;t describe it.  I took valium to sleep last night -5 mg tablets that my doctor gave me Saturday as there seems to be an anxiety panic component going on. I have no history of diagnosed anxiety or panic attacks- I have never felt this way before. Today I feel a little better but still have considerable muscle fatigue and neck and upper back muscle soreness and overall muscle tightness in my arms and legs- feels good to stretch kind of feeling. I have mild dizziness when standing up and turning too abruptly. But no considerable focal neuro deficits.

The pain was much worse in the evening/night and was sometimes absent during the day. Also on day 14 post vaccine (1/7/2021) I developed a cold sore for the first time in my life.

                                                7 days after my first Pfizer COVID vaccine, I developed mastitis. It began in the morning with mild generalized muscle and joint pain and progressed to moderate to severe joint pain, a fever of 102 degrees, and localized redness and swelling of the left breast over the course of 12 hours. Treatment with Cephalexin 500 mg PO QID for 14 days was initiated within 12 hours of onset. The systemic symptoms resolved within 24 hours of treatment onset and the breast redness and swelling resolved within 72 hours.   While I am aware that an infectious mastitis is likely unrelated to the vaccine, I opted to report this incident because I have breastfed 3 children and have never had mastitis prior to this event  and because of the limited information available on this vaccine in lactating women.

I fell asleep. I woke up around 0200 on 1/13/21 with extreme muscle and joint aches, a sensation of pins, needles, and tingling all over my body I felt very jittery and was actually shaking slightly throughout the ordeal.

By 0600 I was feeling better- more relaxed. Muscle aches and sore joints are still present today. Also have a slight increase in temp 99.6 and injection site pain.

Palpable lymph node along left clavicle with similar fluid filled swelling. Took motrin throughout the day and 50 mg of benadryl at bedtime. 1/13: Left arm pit still swollen. more tender with movement. While at work i put hot compress in my arm pit to help with the pain and shortly after i noticed my left arm had bright red streaks from my arm pit to my wrist. It also was very mottled looking. My arm felt tight/heavy  or kind of like a pinched nerve feeling.. I took motrin throughout the day for soreness and took benadryl at bedtime. I place ice pack under my arm during the evening as well.  1/14: Swelling remains in the armpit. Tenderness is getting better. Similar swelling around clavicle . Still taking motrin for inflammation and using ice pack under my arm.

                                                Approximately 28 hours after injection I started experiencing intermittent numbness and tingling in the right hand. At 33 hours post injection developed a deep dull aching pain throughout entire right arm. This worsened, and after 2 more hours intermittent sharp shooting pain down the arm. Pain rated 6 out of 10 intermittently with a constant 3 out of 10 full ache.  Difficulty falling asleep due to discomfort and at one point the pain woke me up from sleep. It was resolving by early the next morning, and disappeared by hour 48 post injection. These pains were not inclusive of the soreness and tenderness of the injection site or the muscle pain when lifting the arm. Those symptoms are still present to a minimal extent 54 hours after injection, at the time I am writing this report.

I slept fairly well on Thursday evening. When I woke up on Friday morning, I had a pounding headache and my body ached. I was still sluggish and tired. Later that morning I also felt very nauseous. Pain relievers did not seem to help relieve any of my symptoms. I also had chills throughout the day. My arm and armpit hurt very bad throughout the day as well. Friday evening I did not sleep well. I was sweating and my body ached all over. Nothing seemed to provide relief. When I woke up on Saturday morning, I still had chills, body aches and a headache.  Pain relievers did seem to help. By about 2pm I started feeling better and like myself again.   Today is Monday and I do still have a sore arm and armpit. My armpit is swollen.

                                                I had terrible insomnia and the worst headache Wednesday night. When I finally went to sleep I tossed and turned and was cold and hot. I woke up with barely any strength. I slept from 8am-1:30pm Thursday. I had body aches, an upset stomach, muscle aches, and overall felt yucky. Friday I went to work for a presentation and was feeling awful. I had a fever and took some ibuprofen. My injection site was swollen and warm to the touch. I was dripping sweat last night Friday night. My lymph nodes are still swollen under my arm where I got the vaccine and my neck.

At 1:00am the next morning I started having chills and shaking which continued until 4am when I started having back cramps and arm cramps where I had my shot. I also felt feverish and had a very bad headache, so I took 600mg  of ibuprofen. I went in to work that morning and had chills and my skin hurt when my clothes touched my skin. I continued to have a headache also. I was sent home by my boss at 12pm on 1/5/21 because I looked and felt so bad and slept through the afternoon and for 10 hours that night. The next day, I continued to take 6oomg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and still had a lot of fatigue. The day after I was tired but them remained symptom free.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I started to have a very mild headache. It felt like a pressure headache. I took Motrin. About 6 hours later that was gone. That night, about 8 hours after vaccine, I began to have muscle aches - whole body. I was very sore. I went to bed. Next day, I had severe joint and muscle aches and pains. The Motrin did not help that. Ice did not help, heat did not help and rest did not help. No headache. I wasn&#39;t red in face etc. Over the next week, I the muscle aches and joint aches were varying between moderate to severe. Some days it did restrict my activity completely. It started to get better week two - but still moderate to severe. I had some abdominal pain on upper left side and my right side (upper, as well) The upper right side pain would go away with ice but the upper left side wasn&#39;t helped with that. The only thing in those two weeks that helped was Celebrex (Motrin stopped helping). After two weeks - around 2/5/2021, I saw my Dr - a virtual visit. He told me to double up on the dose of Celebrex to help with muscle aches, joint aches and right side abdominal pain. Heart palpitations - irregular heartbeat. On 2/7/2021, I took a test for COVID and it was negative.  The joint and muscle aches were moderate to mild the third week. There was no more abdominal pain in third week. Week 4 - mild joint and muscle aches - only a few days that week and that was it. Last week was the first week where I had a few days that were fine. And this week, I have been completely fine. Had general malaise for three weeks solid. And now it&#39;s gone.

I took a dose of oral Benadryl it didn&#39;t go away. It felt like a sunburn.  I had a headache starting at the back of my head. 1st and second day, I had pain in my joints. Not muscular pain. It came and went the joint pain - behind my left knee was hurting really bad and then it went away. Then my right wrist would start hurting and then it would go away, etc. The second day, the headache was more mild - like a mild pressure in my head. The redness was still there - the red face and red arms. My left arm at the site was cherry red and about the size of two inch circle and somewhat raised. The third day, my headache was worse. It was not like a normal headache but an overall pressure in head. Pink and a bit larger but didn&#39;t  hurt as  bad on arm- the redness continued for six days on my face. The headache lasted 14 days straight - Motrin, ice, heat and extra sleep was tried for treatment. On 15th day it started to let up. On 16th day, it was very mild headache. On the 17th day, it was a full blown headache again. Day 18 it was gone. On the second week, I had mild pain in my stomach and then that went away. On day 3, I had about an hour - twice that day - where I was short of breath and then it went away - it was just that day - about noon and at night. I took Benadryl and when I woke up that didn&#39;t  happen again. Doctor called on day 12 - when my headaches weren&#39;t going away. He took some labs. My labs were normal except thyroid (and I already have a condition for my thyroid). Dr. gave me a medication for headache but I didn&#39;t take it - it had a possibility of making me tired and I didn&#39;t want to take it.

Still dry next morning and a couple hrs later it switched to increased salivation.  The evening after injection I had a headache and  just felt general malaise and fatigue, &#34;run down&#34;. Difficulty sleeping that night due to body aches. HEadache, neck and lower back pain. Skin sensitivity when touched, bed sheets kinda hurt my skin. The bodyaches and malaise persisted through out day 2. Tylenol seemed to help.  I slept better that night but woke up with night sweats, completely drenched.  Arm pain at injection site on day 2 that resolved by mid day.  Now 1 week later I have extreme fatigue yesterday and today. I do have hypersomnia but not even my adderall is helping. Not sure if this is related or not.

She got in touch with her provider and was treated with valium and Celebrex. She reported about 2 cm swelling and fatigue. Thirty hours post vaccination, she had pain and swelling and could barely move. Dr. needed to take valium and Celebrex though for those 48 hours, and would have gone to the ER if they had not helped (the pain was that debilitating)

                                                I received the COVID vaccine on Monday Dec. 21, 2020 at 14:30.  By 17:00 I was not feeling well.  I was tired, had a headache, muscle aches, nausea and a fever of 101 F.   The headache, low grade fever and significant malaise continued through Tues Dec 22 and Wed Dec 23.   On Thursday morning Dec 24 at 2:30 AM, I woke from sleep with the urge to use the bathroom.   I suddenly felt light-headed and dizzy and had a diaphoresis that soaked my hair and PJs.   Fortunately my husband who is a nurse anesthetist helped me through the episode safely and was able to get me back to bed.   I am not sure if that event was related to the vaccine or if I happened to be a little dehydrated and had a vaso-vagal event.  I did not take any medications because I was allowing my body to have a natural response to the vaccine.

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL3246/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX). The patient experienced arm pain and headache 4 hours post injection requiring Excedrin. At bedtime, neck stiffness began and worsened. She was treated with lidocaine patches and Aleve. She developed diarrhea 33 hours post injection. She went ER because she was dehydrated. She developed UTI very quickly by hour 35 post injection. She had puffy face and eyes, and burning inside her digestive tract. She was treated with Benedryl at home for allergic reaction, Toradol for pain, IV fluids for dehydration and Keflex for infection. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dehydration cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had very slight nausea soon after the first shot, then started having chills and whole body ache from the night (12/18/2020) for 24 hours followed by spontaneous internal hemorrhage (lower GI, significant blood in stool) in the morning  and in the afternoon of 12/20/2020.  The hemorrhage lasted for about 24 hours.  It started slowing down on 12/21/2020, then stopped.    I was evaluated by Dr., (GI) who was not sure if the bleeding was vaccine induced vs. coincidence on 12/23/2021.  Since the bleeding stopped, she cleared me for the 2nd vaccine and advised me for close monitoring for any other episode of bleeding.  I had some fatigue for about 4-5 days since the first shot, then I felt normalized.    Soon after the 2nd vaccine (in about 5-10mins) on 1/8/2021, I started having some discomfort/pain in lower rib region where spleen is.  Initially I felt like some chest pain, but it was more near spleen region, I think... I also had slight intermittent dizziness for about 2 hours after the 2nd injection.  The discomfort in left lower chest/rib improved and resolved in an hour or so.    Then, similar pattern started including chills and whole body ache on the night of 1/8/2021 followed by internal hemorrhage again (significant blood in stool) in the morning and in the afternoon of 1/9/2021.  The bleeding slowed down on 1/10/2021, then stopped.   I reported it to again my GI doctor on 1/11/2021 who ordered CBC to monitor my platelet level.  The result showed down trending from my baseline.    I think the COVID vaccine transiently affected me with internal hemorrhage and lowering platelets/likely potential thrombocytopenia given the clinical symptoms (spontaneous internal hemorrhage).   Platelet level is improving at this time and I feel normalized today.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

The weakness in legs got much worse and early the following week she started getting the numbness and weakness in arms. She went for the follow up post ED visit with NP at PCP office on 1/20 and due to the continued weakness, after consulting with one of the MDs, decision was made to send her back to ED for further work up to check for GBS including the LP in ED, labs and MRI of head, spine, lumbar and thoracic. Patient was release on Saturday 1/23 and diagnosis was a severe immune response to the vaccine.  Patient still has unsteady gait and weakness.

A 39-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 14Jan2021 at 17:15, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included sporadic neuralgia, numbness to patches on legs, shift-work sleep disorder, and generalized anxiety. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included armodafinil (NUVIGIL), paracetamol (TYLENOL), and alprazolam (XANAX). The patient previously took ferric subsulfate (MONSELS Solution) and experienced allergy; and the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EH9899) on 18Dec2020 (6 PM) for COVID-19 immunization (in left arm). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. On 14Jan2021 (05:15 PM), the interval between the first and second doses of BNT162B2 is 27 days. On 15Jan2021 at 9:15 AM, the patient experienced severe neuralgia pain over 75% of her skin surface beginning at 14 hours post-second dose (as reported) and still continuing now at 30 hours post-dose. Also, the patient experienced severe joint pain, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, headache, fatigue, and upper body sporadic shivering (not cold). It was unknown if the patient received treatment for the events. The events were considered non-serious. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient had not recovered from the events.

My boss came to help walk me outside because I didn?t even feel like it was me walking. I don?t remember walking out of work.  I was there but ?not there?. I was not myself. I didn?t feel like i was in my body. I had to have my husband come get me from work, I slept most the rest of the day and night. Now I?m on day 2 and my joints still ache, my head hurts so bad, I am so tired I either am asleep on the couch or in bed. I have no energy. It takes everything I have to move just to go to the bathroom.

Upon questioning she reported she felt hot and itchy. Upon request she removed her jacket. Vital signs normal. She self-administered 25 mg of Benadryl. About 10 minutes later she reported developing a headache but otherwise reported some improvement in feeling hot and her facial/arm redness improved. She was originally given discharge instructions including home precautions and released to self, however a few minutes after leaving the patient walked back into the vaccination site and reported itching in throat with clearing throat.  Patient was administered epinephrine 0.3mg IM and transferred to ER via EMS.

Those symptoms wore off exactly 25 hours after I had received my second vaccine. But the next day, my asthma got terrible. Over the course of the next week, I was on my steroid inhaler twice a day, and on my nebulizer 4-5 times a day just to breathe. After about 5 days of not getting better, my doctor prescribed me liquid steroids to put in my nebulizer so that they would just target my lungs and not impact the efficacy of the vaccine. Several days later, I was still not better. At that point, I was 12 days out from the second shot. He then ordered me oral steroids that I would taper. After about 3 days without any improvement, he told me to hold at 20 mg of oral prednisone in addition to my steroid inhaler and steroid nebulizer solution. I am now 21 days out from the second shot, and my asthma has not improved. My lungs have had severe inflammation for three weeks now.

                                                10 hrs after I received 1st dose of Pfizer I started feeling my heart beating rapidly and hard.  I was short of breath and had nausea and a headache.  This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

                                                Five hours after receiving vaccine arm became sore and she had difficulty lifting her arm. She then developed joint pain in her left leg and a headache. Then developed joint pain in her hands. By the next day the arm pain had eased but minor joint pain and muscle aches continued. Three days after vaccination, the arm pain returned achiness in joints was throbbing . This is easing 18 days post vaccination but is not gone. The arm pain is gone. The most disturbing symptom occurred two weeks post vaccination. The patient began getting warm sensations in her right foot along the lateral side and occasionally in the heel. This does not hurt but is also persisting and is disturbing. She is uncertain if there is any relationship with her Crohn&#39;s disease.

                                                Began with fever, tonsillitis, sore throat, sinus drainage, muscle aches. Then on Saturday night the body aches were progressively worse and concentrated on left side of body. Joints were affected including left wlbow, wrist, shoulder. Hot viral rash appeared on arm right above left elbow that became painful with swelling and  erythema. In Sunday through the following Wednesday, joint pain continued to worsen and settle in additional joints including first 2 metacarpal bones of both hands almost like arthritic pain. Fingers and joints red and swollen. Pain and swelling next settled in toes of both feet, right side elbow, shoulder and knee. On Monday following vaccine I called employee health and they advised me to come and take covid test. I described symptoms and was told they were side effects of the vaccine and to follow up with a doctor if it continues.  My covid test was negative. On the following Thursday I went to urgent care and described my persisting symptoms.  I was prescribed a methylprednisolone pack and hydroxyzine. I was told to use naproxen as needed. Yesterday  the urgent care sent a check up message. I am still experiencing joint pain although the intensity has decreased but it is still significant pain that is disabling my grip and strengrh overall. The joint pain is mostly just in my upper extremities, hands, fingers  and shoulders now consistently. The np prescribed a 10 day pack of meloxicam to try and help minimize the pain.

                                                The injection of the vaccine was fine.  My arm started getting sore about an hour afterwards.  The next morning I could not lift my arm at all.  About 18 hours after getting the vaccine I had severe body and joint aches, my lymh node in my armpit was swollen and sore (on injection arm), I had a headache, and I was exhausted.  This continued for 48 hours.  The swelling of the lymph node went down and the body and joint pain lessened.  However 5 days after I am still exhausted, dealing with a headache, my arm is still sore, and am experiencing joint pain and back pain.  I was diagnosed with COVID 19 on December 4, 2020, with COVID Pneumonia on Decemeber 13, 2020, and with Post Viral Syndrome on December 28, 2020.

Then on 2/14/2021 I started feeling burning  pain all over my neck and chest. It was slightly red that night. The next morning my chest, neck, and upper back had a red rash . My chest was the worst of it. Felt like a chemical burn . I went to the Doctor on 2/17/2021 and was told it was a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine. I continued to take Benadryl, Zyrtec  and was given Kenalog. On Sunday 2/21/2021 the pain was so pain and the rash was only getting worse and now on my face so I went to urgent care. There I was given a steroid ( prednisone) , derma smoothe and Pepcid. It has been 10 days and no improvement yet.

I had to call off work for the following 2 days as I barely ate or slept during that time. Seventy-two hrs post vaccination, I was able to return to work with only one remaining side effect: lingering stomach cramps.  Self treated with alternating doses of OTC Extra-strength Tylenol and Excedrin Migraine while I was experiencing migraine, fever, myalgia and joint pain. Also took Ultra-strength Rolaids as needed for bloating and stomach cramps.

On February 22, she developed a very severe fatigue associated with the right leg heaviness and numbness. Over the next 3 days, the right leg became weak to the point that she needed to use a cane to ambulate. She also felt heaviness and numbness in the right hand but no clear weakness.  She was then treated with 5 days of high dose steroids (1250 mg of prednisone on day one or early followed by 4 days of 1000 milligrams IVMP. The right hand symptoms improve most, the leg weakness moderately improved but she still required a cane to walk especially the latter half of the day even 2 weeks after the infusions. The fatigue remains an important symptom for her.

This 39-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot#: EN6204), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 10Mar2021 at 10:45 AM (at the age of 39 years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included skin wrinkling. Concomitant medication taken within two weeks of vaccination included botulinum toxin type a (BOTOX) taken for skin wrinkling, and unspecified birth control pills. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot # EN6200, on 18Feb2021, in the right arm COVID-19 immunization, and experienced fatigue. The patient reported that while she was sleeping last night on 11Mar2021 around 02:00-3:00, she had onset of dull ear, neck and jaw pain on left side. She had clicking in her jaw. The patient mentioned she never had a droopy face. She stated she could not walk on her left foot on 11Mar2021 but recovered the next day. She&#39;s concerned these symptoms following vaccine could be Bell&#39;s Palsy - what should I do. She looked online and saw that these are some of the first symptoms of Bell&#39;s palsy. She called to ask if these events could be Bell&#39;s palsy, and for information on events and Bell&#39;s palsy relative to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She informed that she had an upcoming appointment with her doctor &#34;today&#34; at 14:00 to see if she has Bell&#39;s palsy. The patient stated she went to the doctor on 11Mar2021 at 03:00 pm. Event term of Palsy with onset date of 11Mar2021 was reported. The physician did not prescribe medication, no treatment given. The clinical outcome of dull ear, neck and jaw pain, has clicking in her jaw, and palsy was recovered on 13Mar2021

                                                The first abnormal effect I experienced was numbness in my inner upper lip. This was intermittent and lasted roughly 24-48 hours after vaccine administration. Then on 3/25, I had muscle cramping/soreness in my lower leg muscles (calves). The next day (3/26), the muscle soreness continued, and my lower leg muscles began to feel tight when walking. On 3/27, I woke up with numbness and tingling in my right 5th digit, which then spread to all my fingers and toes.  That morning, the muscle soreness had also spread into my thighs and bilateral upper extremities. I also noted mild swelling in my hands and feet and could not put my rings on or wear socks or shoes. By that evening, walking became more difficult as the muscle soreness had now turned into muscle weakness. This prompted me to go the ER for evaluation. A CT scan of my head and lab work was done. I was given IV fluids and sent home with instructions to return to the ER the following day for a MRI of my brain. Overnight, the weakness and swelling in my hands and feet progressed . I became unable to walk, go to the bathroom, or feed my self without assistance. The numbness and tingling I first experienced in my inner upper lip returned, and these symptoms were also now noted in the rest of my face as well. I also began having muscle soreness in my neck, my jaw felt sore when chewing food, and I began seeing some floaters. I returned to the ER the morning of 3/28.  They did more blood work, imaging, as well as a lumbar puncture, and I was admitted to hospital. Once admitted, the hospitalist consulted with another hospital and recommended transfer by EMS there where I was admitted under a neurologist&#39;s care. When I arrived at that hospital, I began to feel somewhat better as the soreness and swelling appeared to be improving, and I could walk without assistance. They did a full neurological workup and kept me overnight for observation. Overnight, I did experience a mild headache that was relieved with Tylenol and rest.  I woke up the next morning  (3/29) with nausea and did have a few episodes of vomiting that turned into dry heaving and was given Zofran with relief. The swelling in my hand went down enough that I was able to make a fist and grasp objects with my fingers again. After the neurologist reviewed my labs and work up the morning of 3/29, I was allowed to return home to await final test results as all my tests were looking normal, my symptoms were continuing to improve, and PT had cleared me to be able to return home. Upon discharge, I was instructed  to not get my 2nd COVID vaccination as it was possible that my symptoms were an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccination as no  other diagnosis was found with testing. I was instructed to follow up with my PCP in one week. Since returning home, I have continued to be very easily fatigued and have had some headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I continue to feel weak when walking and have some muscle stiffness when first waking from sleep. I also continue to have some intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling.

A 39 year old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201,Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in right deltoid on 01Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in left deltoid on 01Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing lung cancer from 03Jul2017, metastatic disease from lung cancer from: Dec 2018 and hypertension from: 2007. Concomitant medication included Losartan at 100 mg once a day tablet for blood pressure, Atorvastatin at 80 mg a day tablet for cholesterol, Lorbrena from 26Jun2019 at 100 mg once a day tablet for lung cancer, vitamin D3 at 3000 IU once a day gel cap and coq10 supplement at 100mg and all the drugs were ongoing. The patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. No AEs (adverse events) following prior vaccination. The patient started feeling better around 27Feb2021. The patient was a cancer patient, and took marijuana and CBD which helps her sleep. The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021. As a treatment therapy the patient received some CBD and went to sleep, and this lasted about 2 days and after that it got a little better. The patient was improved but had slight lasting effects. The patient experienced cough the whole next week which got worse and was so bad and it was productive. The patient had stress urinary incontinence and was back on her pee pads that she had not been on for years. The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy. The patient found the lymph node and called her oncologist because she was worried about the worsening cough. The patient also reached to a Nurse Practitioner and the only thing that worried her was the cough, that she has not seen this in the data so far. The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past. The patient was all related to her lung cancer. The patient called her neuro oncologist and they said to go to ER (emergency room) on 23Mar2021. The patient had newfound brain cancer, and it was worsening, that it was only found Tuesday. The patient underwent brain MRI on 23Mar2021. This was new worsening disease, before it was stable and not getting worse or better, it was not active in the brain and felt a little nervous all the side effects after she got it. The outcome of the event Extreme bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso, Pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to BNT162b2 and can be attributed to intercurrent conditions in this patient with underlying lung cancer, metastatic disease from lung cancer and other comorbidities. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Joint and muscle pain that is worse than I think is typical. Joint pain was somewhat similar to that caused by ciprofloxacin, in my knees. Muscle pain was intense enough that it caused mobility problems that lasted a few days after the side-effects themselves disappeared. Basically, the side-effects seemed to trigger an Ehlers-Danlos flareup that lasted several days where I was barely mobile. I&#39;ve since recovered and feel normal again.

                                                numbness, tingling, and swelling of her hands and feet; numbness, tingling, and swelling of her hands and feet; numbness, tingling, and swelling of her hands and feet; muscle weakness; unable to walk unassisted; Vitamin D deficiency; muscle cramps in her lower extremities that progressed to her upper extremities and neck; muscle soreness in her lower extremities that progressed to her upper extremities and neck; intermittent numbness/tingling of my inner upper lip; intermittent numbness/tingling of my inner upper lip; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP) reported for herself. A 39-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN16208) at the age of 39-years-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient was not pregnant. Medical history included Hormonal Acne, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included spironolactone taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; esomeprazole magnesium (NEXIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aluminium hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate, sodium alginate (PEPCID) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took cefalexin monohydrate (KEFLEX) and experienced allergy. The patient initially had some intermittent numbness/tingling of her inner upper lip that began within the first hour of receiving the vaccine on 19Mar2021 and lasted about 24 hours. Six days following vaccination on 25Mar2021, the patient began having muscle cramps/muscle soreness in her lower extremities that progressed to her upper extremities and neck, By the eighth day on 27Mar2021, she had developed numbness, tingling, and swelling of her hands and feet. On this day, she also began having muscle weakness and was unable to walk unassisted by the end of the day. She was seen in the Emergency room (ER), admitted, and transferred to another facility. The patient hospitalized for 1 day. She underwent a Computerised tomogram (CT) scan of my head, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of my brain/neck, lumbar puncture, and extensive blood work. All of her work up was unremarkable except for showing that she had a Vitamin D deficiency. Her symptoms began to improve without treatment in the hospital, and she was discharged home with the diagnosis that she had most likely had an unusual, adverse reaction to her 1st dose of the COVID 19 vaccine and was instructed not to receive my 2nd dose. Covid tested post vaccination (Nasal swab) on 28Mar2021: Negative. The outcome of the events &#39;numbness/tingling of my inner upper lip&#39; was recovered on 20Mar2021 and the outcome of the other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a positive temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported Myalgia, Muscle cramps, Hypoasthesia, Parasthesia, Pheripheral swelling, Muscle weakness and Vitamin D Defiency.
