Her eyes looked like they were glazed- not responding; didn&#39;t look bright. She got some water and an ice pack on her back and removed her shoes and put her feet up. After drinking the water and keeping the ice pack on for the rest of those 15 minutes. Nurses were there watching her. And she was able to walk out of the clinic on her own power. It had looked like she maybe would have passed out without the intervention of water, ice pack and getting her feet up.  She had muscle pain in her arm (of injection site)  that day and into the next day. The muscle pain in her arm lasted for about 24 hours.

                                                She was taking  Claritin for the few days before this event. She normally takes it every fall and every spring. She had seasonal allergy symptoms on the days leading up to this event- she had sore throat, runny nose, a little headache and congestion and developed a cough; on the day of this symptoms she spiked a low grade fever - 100.5. I did a rapid test for COVID at home which was negative for her. Sudden onset: A bunch of knives poking her on the inside of her stomach - pokey from hips to ribs.  She started to double over and bend over. Within 10 minutes, she couldn&#39;t stand up. She was telling me that something was really wrong. This isn&#39;t her character so I knew it was very wrong. I took her to ER. I was still concerned about appendicitis or COVID. This episode lasted for 90 minutes and then it came and went for the rest of the night and then after that - she had runny nose and congestion (normal allergies after that). She was better before they gave her the medication but it didn&#39;t seem like she really needed them. She was improving before she got either of the medications: Zofran; Levsin. They gave her a dosage of each there and  sent home with a prescription but we never had them filled as she was feeling better. - As it started to improve - it ( being the pokey pain) it was located closer to her ribs and breastbone.

That day she had headache, sore arm with earache and joint pain. Those symptoms continued for several days with some loose stools which lasted for two to three days with abdominal pain which persisted for a little over two weeks. We visited the doctor because of ear and throat pain and nausea. All tests were negative, but the symptoms improved slowly but they are totally resolved right now.

                                                After the second dose she had immediate pain at the injection site and over the next 24 hours she developed: A fever of 101.4 severe abdominal pain and chest pain that made her feel like her heart was being pulled out painful electric shocks down her neck and spine that made her walk hunched over numbness and swelling in the arm she got the shot pain in her fingers and toes that turned white and were ice cold to the touch  Over the next 2.5 months her abdominal, muscle and nerve pain became unbearable plus she developed new symptoms:  Fatigue gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting Eventually she couldn?t even swallow food or liquids without immediately spitting it up. An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

                                                Patient started having bilateral arm weakness on 6/13. She was evaluated in emergency room and found to have markedly elevated CPK to &gt;7000 and mildly elevated AST (195) and ALT (70),  and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and admitted to hospital where she was treated with IV fluids. Her CPK peaked at 11,400. She improved on IV fluids and was discharged home on 6/16. On follow up visit in clinic on 6/19 her CPK had improved to 1151, her liver enzymes were trending down and her symptoms were completely resolved. Hospitalist felt rhabdomyolysis was due to activity as patient had been training for a  black belt, but parents report no recent change in training schedule or intensity and concerned that this may be effect of vaccine given timing of onset of symptoms

                                                6/12 - patient developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. Worsened gradually with difficulty swallowing. 6/16 - presented to ED. Patient also reported rash in right lower extremity that is pruritic, 2 episodes of non-bloody non-bilious emesis daily since Saturday, intermittent chest pain and dyspnea, myalgias, diarrhea, generalized abdominal pain, and neck pain. Concern for infectious mononucleosis with lymphadenitis. Prescribed Augmentin and discharged home. 6/17 - returned to ED due to worsening rash (no longer pruritic) and diarrhea. Continued fever and neck pain. Hypotensive requiring 3L bolus and norepi. Large volume diarrhea. Mild AKI that resolved with fluid resuscitation. Treated broadly with antibiotics for toxic shock syndrome but rash was not consistent and cultures were negative, so eventually narrowed to ampicillin-sulbactam. Neck pain and swelling improved, but fever persisted through 6/19. Transferred to the floor on 6/20 and gradually improved without further intervention. Antibiotics were continued to target possible tonsillitis/lymphadenitis, but course did not seem to be truly responding to these antibiotics. CRP continued to increase despite antibiotics. Patient&#39;s presentation seemed most consistent with MIS-C; she also met criteria for incomplete KD with fever, rash, cervical lymphadenopathy and lab abnormalities, but this was felt less likely and she was not treated with IVIG or any other anti-inflammatories. Patient eventually improved and was discharged home 6/24.

                                                My daughter experienced on day of her 2nd vaccine, feel nauseated in the evening time, then the second day. Felt very lethargic, fatigue, laying in bed all day, sleeping. She still had nausea also experienced chills, highest temp 99.8F. Her arm pit on the right side where she got the vaccine was really sore. She basically like within a couple of days she started her period cycle again and it was very heavy and lasted one week and half almost two weeks. On 06-08-2021, at about 10pm, she was brushing her teeth when she saw black spots and she went to tell me. At about 11:30pm that night, she squatted to pat our dog and when she got up and she felt really dizzy, lightheaded so I got concerned. Her symptoms persisted and I scheduled an appointment with her pediatrician on 06-15-2021. The pediatrician ruled out anemia. Her pediatrician said she has Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Her pediatrician said that this is something manageable, she needs to strengthen her calf muscles and drink lots of water. They monitored her heart pressure and blood pressure.  Her heart rate had increased to 40bpm.  I also gave her Ibuprofen medication after the vaccine. Leading to today she has been having dizziness and light headiness every single day. My daughter is still  experiencing  symptoms, dizzy and light headed today.   For her 1st vaccine- within few days after her 1st dose, she experienced when using the treadmill, she would feel very dizzy. I did not think anything of it at first and this happened three times then it stopped. She also had a sore arm.

It started near the injection site, then on her wrist (same arm) then on her chin, same left side. After a few more days she started getting them all over: legs, chest etc. They itch her like crazy and burn when she tries not to itch.

The patient experienced Meningitis pain on unspecified date, lip swelling and numbness, itching on face, hands and feet / caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch in Jun2021. She has pressure on her chest on 09Jun2021. She had pressure behind her eyes, muscle pain,she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills , sore throat, nauseous, caller states she was assuming hives, inflammation stayed around awhile , body aches / pain through her head and back down her neck, trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful , she was slumpy, swelling from the digging and scratching, her hands began to swell yesterday in Jun2021. she woke up and said her face felt funny on 09Jun202. she was just not feeling right and couldn&#39;t walk by herself on Jun2021, Caller relays her daughter will be (withheld) . HCP: Caller states she called the pediatrician office and 1 was by phone and she was seen by this provider yesterday and she encouraged her to reach out to us as well. Mom states she was aware of the possible symptoms to occur and her daughter came home Tuesday perfectly fine and went to bed and woke up with the typical symptoms, she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills, sore throat, nauseous and had all the symptoms pretty much. States she didn&#39;t have anything weird going on during the observation time the day of the vaccine. Caller relays her daughter didn&#39;t have anything weird after her 1st dose. Caller states she took a nap Wednesday about 24 hours after her 2nd dose and she woke up and her lips had begun to swell and she woke up and said her face felt funny and it was itchy. Caller states she was assuming hives. Caller states that there was nothing concerning as it wasn&#39;t in that initial 15minutes to 4 hour and that this occurs 24 hours after and that was a concern. Caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch and that was kind of along the same lines and said hives and she would itch itch itch and there was swelling from the digging and scratching. Caller states she has numbness in her lip with the swelling. Caller states the other symptoms that are bizarre is more yesterday and it started some on Wednesday she had a pressure in her chest and this was a child, her daughter was very strong, she got up yesterday and tried to do school and had a fever of 102 and Wednesday evening was so sick with symptoms and she still tried. Caller states the pressure in her chest is concerning and told them yesterday and she needed to be seen. States her daughter described it to the doctor that it felt like someone was sitting on her chest sort of pressure and on a scale of 1-10 she was a 7. Caller provides that not at any time did she experience trouble breathing and she never saw her lose or get weird coloring. Caller states she called her doctor Wednesday afternoon and talked to another doctor, that she called the help line after hours as they close 4:30 or 5pm. States she was told it was good news that she did not have trouble breathing but to have it at this point was weird and no one knows what to expect and everyone is different. States she was told to do Benadryl and continue with pain medication for fever and discomfort. Caller states her daughter was miserable the rest of the evening. Caller relays that the swelling subsided and the inflammation stayed around awhile and yesterday she woke up better with no nausea and the common symptoms are better and she still had the fever. Caller relays that at about 9:00 she began to have a problem where she said that behind her eyes she had significant pressure and that scared the caller what with the brain and swelling. Caller states her hands began to swell yesterday, like her lip and her fingers are itchy and swelling and it&#39;s constant itching and the pressure on her chest yesterday, that those 3 things freaked the caller out and she called the pediatrician and they said to have her checked out to make sure as nobody wanted to rush her to the ER as she was not struggling to breathe she was just not feeling right. Caller states the pediatrician did her research about heart inflammation and listened to her heart a couple of times and said her best observation for rubbing sounds was she did not hear any. Caller states when her daughter was younger she had meningitis and went through a whole lot with that and caller states she does not immediately rush to the hospital as that brings back emotions with that. Caller states the doctor said she didn&#39;t see any immediate distress and would do an EKG or they could wait and see, that she thought the pressure might be like body aches and her daughter had laid in bed all day the day before and had a time with it. Caller states she couldn&#39;t walk by herself and she was out of it. Caller states she could do the EKG or wait until today and they chose to wait. States that today she seems better and the only thing today is the continuing pressure behind her eyes that her daughter described as it felt like someone had 2 spoons and was trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful. Caller relays her daughter has been through meningitis pain and has pain through her head and back down her neck and the concern is swelling. Caller states it could be a weird reaction and the doctor thinks it is a weird headache she is having and is still doing ibuprofen. Caller relays that her chest is not nearly as heavy today and she has taken Benadryl again for itching and swelling. States the doctor says they don&#39;t know what did it because the risk was there and the benefit and don&#39;t want to get reactions. Caller states she had no problem with getting the shot, that weird things happen and the pediatrician is saying it can happen but doesn&#39;t know. States it is kind of scary. Caller states they checked her out and they checked her oxygen and blood pressure and that made the caller feel better. States that 9:30-10 last night after she got home she was slumpy and her head was hurting and she had chest pressure. Caller states with the hand swelling, that the caller herself went through reaction and hives and the doctor had asked if her daughter had anything new introduced and no nothing was and her daughter didn&#39;t seem concerned to share this but after her 1st dose her hands itched and she didn&#39;t pay it any mind. States she had no face swelling. Caller states she is wondering if those little hand itches after the 1st dose she didn&#39;t tell about till now was that a little bit of a sign that something else was there. States she didn&#39;t mention it after the 1st dose and was good to go. States after the 2nd dose she said mommy my hands itched after the 1st dose, her lip didn&#39;t swell and she told the doctor it&#39;s not conditions on the list of symptoms and she didn&#39;t have breathing issues. Caller states it&#39;s a non severe reaction and is assuming to dose and said yesterday if she gets a booster what does Pfizer advise. Caller states they have all intention of getting what she needs in the future. Caller states she wants to make sure she doesn&#39;t have worse and the lip swelling was freaky. Caller states she thought her daughter was out of the woods after the 20 minutes waiting and was home and then turned. Caller states it was pretty straight forward and knew what the expected symptoms were and they were fine and knew she was having the exact ones on the list and was not feeling well and had a fever. States she was thrown for a loop when others came up and the fact that they were 24 hours out, that she got the 2nd dose 4-4:15 on Tuesday and these evolved well after that time. Caller said they said to report this and her hope is that they can help if someone else has this issue. States when she said she was laying there my hands did itch after the 1st but not like this to this degree. States she never said anything and caller didn&#39;t know. States she knows as a parent there are certain questions to ask and warning signs of potential allergic reactions. Caller states she is assuming this is some sort of allergic reaction, not the worst kind but pressure in the chest and other concerns about her heart having some sort of issue she knows have been reported.Caller states that today she could have done the EKG for more information but based on her listening and what she wanted to thinking the body aches and extensive issues with that she is glad she waited. States she was laying in bed at 6:30 and asked her if she wanted to get the EKG and she said she was afraid of going to the hospital and it&#39;s not fun but would give answers if there is something else and she laid in bed until 9:30-10 and gave her more Benadryl and Ibuprofen and continued with that for the discomfort behind her eyes and the doctor is thinking it&#39;s body aches. States the fever subsided yesterday.Caller states she would like to share that her daughter is a tough kid and tough kids can be taken down too and may not pay attention. Caller states she doesn&#39;t over react but she is aware and if she had told her about her hands she would have thought allergic reaction, mild one and brought her to the doctor or at the 2nd vaccine and she didn&#39;t say anything until after the fact. Caller relays her daughter has never been through hives and the caller has and has a lot of seasonal and environmental allergies and the caller was that kid. Caller states with her daughter not having seen her lip swell and her eyes started hurting and she started thinking the worst. States the doctor pushed on her and checked her lymph nodes and did a thorough exam that lasted about 30 minutes and nobody knows. States she appreciates all that Pfizer and the other companies have done, that we need this.Caller states her daughter goes to the pediatrician in 2 weeks for her annual check up. States the doctor yesterday said her body responded and had a hard time with it. States she does the flu shot every year and this was weird and she wanted us to know and hopes this report can help. Caller states her daughter is a tough kid nobody knows and today she is better, she has a headache behind her eyes still there.Caller relays that Friday she had her annual eye check up and it&#39;s not a vision thing, that was fine until Wednesday and other other stuff and yesterday with pressure and she is sure it&#39;s residual and her body adjusting and if she can help with letting other people know.Caller relays if it comes back she is going to do the EKG, that she is not the parent to say it is nothing and will follow through with Pfizer also. Caller states she didn&#39;t have anything weird for heart beat and no rubbing sound and no signs and she thinks it was issues from body aches and hopefully she is on the up and up and nobody will have to leave and go to the doctor today. And didn&#39;t think because it was not an immediate issue with her breathing and nothing like that and didn&#39;t think it would be an issue with a booster. Caller states it could be that instead of sitting for 20 minutes they keep her longer and that when she fills out the sheet if was not an option, she knows there is severe reaction listed, she will make notes and make the person giving the dose aware that she had the delayed what they are believing to be allergic reaction and make sure, that she may never have it again and it could have been her system was so under attack. Caller states she doesn&#39;t understand vaccines and knows it&#39;s the body&#39;s job to do something and she is not reluctant helping her be immune and she understands what to do in the event and doesn&#39;t have an epi pen and her daughter has no allergies and no reactions to anything. Caller states she didn&#39;t have the worry, that there is always a chance and you worry when something foreign goes in the body that there is a chance to react. Investigations: Caller states they listened to her heart and took her vitals and tests with her fingers checking her eyes to make sure her pupils were dilating correctly and move her eyes with a moving finger. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know the medical term but the basics and let them know she was not in dire straights to rush to the hospital immediately. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement, body temperature: 102 fahrenheit, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, vital signs measurement was unknown and unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lip swelling and numbness, itching on face, hands and feet / caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch, pressure on her chest , fever, swelling from the digging and scratching. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Friday, 5/21 around 11:55 she received her first dose.  20 minutes later she complained that it felt like someone punched her in the face, and her left cheek was swelling.  She looked woozy, with her eyes closing, and the nurses laid her down on the floor on a mat.  Her tongue and throat began swelling, and she was having extreme difficulty breathing.  She then could not feel anything from her neck down, like she was paralyzed.  The nurse administered an Epipen and EMS showed up minutes later.  In the ambulance, EMS administered another Epipen, gave her a steroid and Benadryl and rushed her to the hospital.  Once at the ER, she was still having a hard time breathing, and could not feel anything from the waist down and could not move her legs.  She also complained about her spine being in extreme pain around the mid to lower back.  When her symptoms did not resolve, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment.  She had extreme pain in her joints - spine, hips, knees, ankles and toes, if someone tried to move them, she could not move on her own.  She also had tingling and numbness that would travel up and down her body - weakness in her arms and legs.  The medical staff continued with Bendryl - switched to Adderax, and Motrin and steroids (Prednisone?).  She was discharged from the hospital Sunday, 5/23/21 in the afternoon.  This morning (Monday 5/24/21) she is still experiencing back and leg pain, weakness and cannot walk with out assistance and it is extremely painful.

                                                On Sunday 5/23/2021 my daughter woke up to swelling, redness &amp; pain of the 1st metatarsal of her left foot.  One Monday 5/24/21 the swelling and symptoms in that region had resolved however throughout the day her right hand started to swell, become red and hurt.  This  the throughout the thumb and pointer finger region of her right hand.  The swelling and redness  spread further and could be seen on both palms just below the pointer finger as well as the top of her left foot.  A visit to the doctor was completed on Sunday evening 5/24/21.   The provider we saw believes it to be some for of reaction but it couldn&#39;t be determined if it was environmental, antibiotic or vaccine related.  She was given 2 Benadryl 25 mg tablets after the medical appointment.  As of this morning 5/25/21 I administered anther 25 mg Benadryl and instructed her to take a second dose around 11am at school.   She is reporting there is still swelling in her hand but it doesn&#39;t hurt as bad as it did yesterday.  Her PCP contacted my via phone today and is discussing her case with pediatric rheumatology as she also feels it could be a sign of allergic reaction but since much of the swelling is near joints she has reached out to them and I am waiting to hear back.

He reports that she fainted but had some seizure-type activity, but minimalized. She was monitored by both RN and myself. She was lowered to the floor to lay on the floor, was fanned, and her BP and pulse were monitored by RN. She was accompanied by her mother, and her mother declined having EMS contacted. Once patient regained consciousness, she was alert, laughed and talked to us, and regained a sitting position. We then gave her cold water to drink, and she was able to get up into a chair. After sitting for several minutes, she was able to walk out of the room and into one of our monitoring cubicles for an extended monitoring timeframe. We kept her here for 30 minutes for further observation, then left accompanied by her mother. Due to RN&#39;s report of the seizure-type activity, mom is going to contact patient&#39;s pediatrician to see if further treatment is needed.

I took her to Urgent care because she was having chest pain, nausea and headaches. She also had 99.2F of fever but no congestion or cough.  At the ER an EKG was done and it was a bit off, lab work was also performed, x-ray of the chest was also done and they gave her an Albuterol treatment. She was given IV fluids and steroids and a CT scan of the chest was also performed. After 9 hours, she was discharged home and could not find anything wrong. On 05-25-2021 I took her to her pediatrician who pushed on her chest and it hurt her when he did this, her pain level was between 5 and 8 out of 10 on VAS scale. EKG&#39;s were performed as well as lab work, x-ray of the chest at the pediatrician office. Her daughter also said her chest hurt her to exhale and inhale.  The pediatrician said that her rib cage and breast bone where inflamed upon pressing on her daughter&#39;s chest and that she has s costochondritis. As of today my daughter still has nausea that comes and goes and also continues with the headaches and takes Ibuprofen as pain medication.

Later in the afternoon on Sunday, the family went to their lake house in New Auburn, MN. Mother reports that the patient ate a good supper and the patient was asked to take the dog for a walk around 8pm. Patient took the dog for a walk for about 5 minutes, and then came back and went to her room, and her older sister found her lying in her room with her arms flexed and legs extended. Mom reports that she was drooling, staring and her muscles were stiff, and she wouldn&#39;t bear weight on her legs. This lasted approximately 10 minutes and she was transferred by ambulance to the Bloomer ER for evaluation. Initial ER workup in Bloomer showed leukocytosis at 11.4, a CK of 333, and an alk phos of 263. Her CBC, Comp, CRP, Lactate, pregnancy, lymes, COVID and UA were all within normal limits. A head CT was negative as well. Given her symptoms, she was transferred from Bloomer ER to St. Mary&#39;s in Rochester to the general pediatric floor early Monday morning.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

A 13-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: Unknown) via unspecified route of administration, on an unknown date (reported as: 2 weeks ago, as of tomorrow) (at the age of 13 years old)as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 Immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unknown date, the patient experienced Pain in arm initially, Knee pain started about 2 weeks after getting vaccine, it was like bilateral knee pain mostly with exercise. She did not have it the first few days of the shot like she would expect she normally would. She did not have it until last week. It was only when running last week and now she is still having it. Reporter reported that she was concerned about getting her daughter the second dose of vaccine and would like to know if this has been reported.

                                                Patient is a 13-year-old who was transferred from another hospital for chest pain in the setting of Covid vaccination.   She received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, June 29.  On Wednesday she developed fatigue chest pain shortness of breath weakness, nausea and mild abdominal pain.  She also had a fever to 102.5 Fahrenheit.  mom is a nurse and took her pulse and felt that it was 30 and fast.  She then took 1 with her home equipment it was in the 120s.  She called her neighbor who took her pulse and it was in the 130s.  She then transferred her to another Hospital for further care at hospital her vital sinus evaluation was a temperature of 37.4 pulse 119 respiratory rate is 15 blood pressure 106/62 satting 98% on room air.  On exam she was well appearing with tenderness to palpation of sternum heart rate normal rate and rhythm lungs clear bilaterally and abdominal exam benign. they obtain CBC with white count of 4.8 hemoglobin 12.9 Camm that was unremarkable LFTs are within normal limits troponin that was negative BNP 223 with a normal upper limit of 125 ESR 2 D-dimer 0.697 with upper limit of normal 0.5 and a CRP of 9 with upper limit of normal of 8.1.  UA bland. She was given Toradol for chest pain EKG with sinus tachycardia .  She was given 1/2 L normal saline bolus ondansetron Toradol and started on maintenance IV fluids of D5 NS.  She was then transferred to another hospital for further care .    Upon arrival here she notes improvement in her energy level and all of her pain except for her chest pain.  She describes it as a pressure on top of her chest that is right in the center and is worse with movement and deep breaths.   Of note she had a appendectomy a few years ago that was complicated by surgeons making the bowel and then required her to have a bowel resection.  She has no dietary restrictions and eats by mouth, no GI complications in the long-term.     PMH: as above  PSH: No significant past surgical history  FH: Reviewed and noncontributory to current presentation  SH: Lives with caregivers   Meds: None  Allergies: No known drug allergies  Immunizations: UTD   Review of Systems       Constitutional:  fever, no chills, no sweats,  fatigue Skin: no rash, no lesions,  Eye: no redness ENMT: no ear pain, no sore throat, no congestion, no hoarseness  Respiratory: &#43; shortness of breath, no cough, no wheezing  Cardiovascular: &#43; chest pain, no palpitations,  Gastrointestinal: &#43; nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no GI bleeding  Genitourinary: no dysuria, no hematuria,  Musculoskeletal:  &#43; muscle pain,  Neurologic: no headache, no dizziness, no numbness, no weakness  Psychiatric: no sleeping problems,  Allergy/Immunologic: no recurrent infections,  Additional ROS info: All other systems of a 10 system review are negative.  Briefly, patient is presenting with chest pain, myalgias, and fever in setting of recent covid vaccine (2nd dose Pfizer 2 days ago).  Seen at an outside hospital where labs were notable for mildly elevated BNP and D-dimer, negative troponin, normal LFTs and chemistries.  Chest x-ray reportedly negative.  EKG with T wave inversions in V1 through V4 (read as nonspecific ST changes by their physician), but otherwise normal.  Given the possibility of post Covid vaccine myocarditis or PE, transferred for further management.  Patient states that after Toradol that she received the outside hospital all of her other symptoms have resolved but she continues to have chest pain.     My exam showed: Gen: tired but nontoxic appearing, no acute distress, alert and active; HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, normal conjunctiva, neck supple without LAN; Chest: significant reproducible chest pain; Card: RRR, no murmur, good perfusion, brisk radial pulses bilaterally; Lungs: CTAB, good air entry, no increased WOB; Abd: soft, non-tender, non-distended, no masses; Ext: warm and well perfused, moving all extremities; Skin: no rashes     Chest pain. Overall well appearing with normal exam with reproducible tenderness.  Given recent Covid vaccine, must consider myocarditis, although only mildly elevated BNP and negative troponin at the outside hospital are reassuring, especially given reproducible pain and reassuring EKG.  Symptoms then may represent musculoskeletal etiology such as costochondritis or myositis related to vaccination.  Less likely pneumonia or pneumothorax, but possible.  Low suspicion for PE given lack of persistent tachycardia (tachycardia improved while in ED, currently HR 80s) or hypoxia. EKG obtained which showed T wave inversions in V1-V4 (normal for age).  Bedside ultrasound with normal global function and lack of pericardial effusion.  Labs obtained in BCH ED notable for negative BNP and troponin, along with reassuring lipase given abdominal pain.  Thus, unlikely to be true myocarditis, more likely musculoskeletal etiology such as costochondritis or chest wall pain.  Cardiology will discuss with mom for reassurance.  Final Diagnosis  1. Chest pain R07.9 2. Fever R50.9 3. Fatigue R53.83 4. Shortness of breath R06.00  PLEASE NOTE:  Since the patient is not from here, we do not have access to her vaccination records and cannot supply lot number, etc.

                                                I administered the vaccine, got one side of the band-aid on and that is when her head fell back.  Her eyes rolled into the back of her head; she then leaned over the right arm of the chair.  Her body stiffened next. I held her head and body with the help of a colleague.  This happened for about 10 seconds, then she woke up and snatched her mask off with a confused look on her face.  We asked her questions to see if she was aware. She was, then she went back out falling over to the side.  I called 911. When she awakened the second time after about 7-10 seconds her face turned pale.  We then moved her to the floor and propped her feet up.  Patient said she was nervous and felt like she had to use the restroom.  Her skin was clamy; patient said clamy skin is nothing new for her.  The fire truck and ambulance arrived on scene.  The workers began to assess patient.  Vitals were good. She did not go in the ambulance, but stated her vision were blurry.  She went home with grandparents.

A 14-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 (at the age of 14-years-old) as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced sharp pain in her neck and shoulder and her arm was hurting/ arm pain on 17May2021 night. The reporter was concerned because the pain appeared after a few days and not within 24-48 hours. She asked is this could be an indication that the vaccine was placed in the wrong place like not in the muscle. She asked if this is normal or when the patient should have this checked. The reporter stated that her and her husband did not experience any side effects. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Suddenly I looked up, I noticed her body stiffened and her eyes closed. she tumbled to the floor and hit her head on the ground. Paramedics were dispatched immediately.  patient woke up right away, we checked her pulse, forehead for fever, and back of her head for any possible bleeding.  She answered all questions that we asked of her correctly (such as her name, her age, etc.) Paramedics arrived, took her blood pressure, oxygen level (both normal), blood sugar (normal). Parents decided to take her to hospital for further evaluation.  I called and spoke to Dad 5 hours later, dad stated that she is doing fine.

                                                I have pictures I can upload. She had severe hives - flat, red rash on legs and arms. Very itchy; swollen ankles and swollen wrists and hands. She could barely  move her feet they were so swollen. That happened within 12 hours. And at the doctor&#39;s appt online, she said to give her a double dose an antihistamine - I think it was Zyrtec - and Benadryl at night and to be on Cortosteriod cream on the swollen parts. We did that for about three or four days until it was bearable and it stopped. About three days after it stopped  and she wasn&#39;t taking meds she had another break out - it almost looked  more like blisters - on torso and on arm. We did the same treatment with meds and cream and it went away within 24 hours. I showed to Pharmacist and the Pharmacist said to give an extra week for the next dose of vaccine to give body a chance to rest.

A 14-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder on 23May2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. Family history was reported as none, they were basically a healthy family. Patient was not vaccinated within 4 weeks and no additional Vaccines administered on same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. On 23May2021, the patient experienced extreme weakness in her arms and legs, really bad cough, on an unspecified date in May2021, she had severe pain in her legs and on an unspecified date in 2021, she was not been feeling well. Patient&#39;s father called on behalf of his 14-year-old daughter who received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine about two weeks ago and had extreme weakness in arms and legs, 2 weeks ago, on Sunday 23May2021. She had not been to school since then, she went for a couple hours and then they send her back. His daughter also said that it had been painful but caller states that he does not know exactly what his daughter means by that, she said that her legs hurt her, that started probably 24May2021 or 25May2021 with the bad cough also and not been feeling well. Had all leveled out the past 10 days. Had blood work and the results came back Friday. Thought there was an outside chance based on the blood work that it was strep related. Her doctor had suggested that the parents call Pfizer to see if this type of reaction had been reported in her age group after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She never really had a fever. This started the day after the vaccine, and they are not sure if it was related to the vaccine or not. A couple of results were off. The Streptolysins were 468. The antinuclear antibodies were 1 to 160, which was off. Everything else was negative. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included antinuclear antibody: 1 to 160, streptococcus test: 468. Patient received therapeutic measure to treat adverse events, they tried Amoxicillin, which had no impact, they thought maybe it was just a virus. They also tried Tylenol and Advil, which also had no impact. Stated that the Amoxicillin was 875mg twice a day and that the Tylenol and Advil were from different packages lying around the house. Patient was scheduled for the second dose this coming Sunday but they were holding off until she was better. The outcome of events was unknown.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On sunday night, about 36 hours after vaccination, she started to have numbness of her lower jaw and tongue. She started to have an incredible amount of drooling and could not swallow. She then started to have epigastric cramping and sharp abdominal pain that moved into the right lower quadrant. She had pretty severe headache that started the same time as numbness and drooling with photosensitivity. No fever. No vomiting but she was nauseous.  she went to the ER late on 6/13.  She was then transferred to the hospital for furthur care. She had a neurology consult that thought perhaps her headache, numbness and drooling could have been an atypical migraine-this resolved as of 6/14.  Her abdominal pain resolved after appendectomy and now she just has muscular pain related to surgery.

                                                After vaccination, patient stood up and walked around the room. She started bouncing and acting a little nervous. I asked if she was feeling light headed woozy, she said a little bit. I sat her back in the chair. After about 30 seconds she fell sideways to the arm of the chair then slouched forward. I caught her before she went all the way to the floor and leaned her back into the chair, she then seized for approximately 3-5 seconds. Grandpa (legal guardian) was in the room and helped me get her to the floor where she came out for a few seconds and opened her eyes for 5-10 seconds passed out again then seized again for 3-5 seconds. She then woke up on the floor and was alert and looking around.  She was very pale, I elevated her feet for a while and had her lay on the floor for 7-10 minutes.  I then had her sit up on the floor and provided a bottle of water and put cold compress on the back of her neck.  She stayed seated on the floor for about 5-7 minutes before I had her move to the chair to sit again with back against the back of the chair. She continued to sit there sipping water and talking for 7 minutes or so. Learned at this point that patient had not eaten breakfast and has passed out after a vaccination in the past (had not marked on the intake form). After 7 minutes or so, had the patient try to stand. She said her legs were wobbly, so I had her sit back down for several more minutes. Her coloring was much better at this point.  After another several minutes we tried standing again and she felt better at that point. Had her just stand in the room for about 3 minutes before walking to the waiting room. Had her then sit in the waiting room for 5 minutes then she walked out with grandpa. They were going to get breakfast. Grandpa was going to call MD to discuss the events and follow up as necessary as well as to discuss plan going forward concerning the second dose.

She then started feeling dizzy and looked like she was going to pass out and he caught her and he laid on her on the floor on a pillow.   There was a off-duty paramedic to assist her and they suggested to call 9-1-1 and they showed up 5-6 minutes later.  She was then taken to Hospital.  They ran a lot of laboratory tests, urinalysis and everything was negative.   Her white blood cell count was high and her URC&#39;s and UBC&#39;s were high.  Her albumin was also high.   She was then released from the ER and was told to FU with PCP within 2 days.  She is still having the symptoms of headache, sore throat, and achy bones, the typical flu-like side effects.   She is taking Tylenol for the symptoms, as well as cough drops for her throat.

She also felt tingling in both arms, both hands, her face, and torso; she also had a lot of pain in her back. She felt that her face was hot but to the touch it was not.  After about 20 minutes of these sensations her fingers cramped in gnarled positions that she was unable to straighten. Her right hand fingers was more rigid than her left.  This lasted about 30 minutes and then she was slowly able to straighten her fingers.  By the time she went to bed, around 10 pm, she felt basically back to normal.

                                                About an hour after receiving the 2nd vaccine, she developed a pain in the upper-mid sternal area.  She&#39;s not had any pain like this in the past.  The pain remained constant ever since it started, and there don&#39;t appear to be any alleviating factors such as position changes.  Deep inspiration makes it worse.  The pain radiates at times across the upper chest and down the back.  She&#39;s had some accompanying nausea.  She&#39;s also noticed feeling a little short of breath as the day progressed, which is not necessarily related to the pain.  She denies any palpitations or dizziness.  No near syncope or syncope.  The pain remained  a maximum intensity of 10/10. She therefore presented to the ER. Diagnostic studies including labs, EKG and a CT pulmonary angiogram were performed.  Troponin returned as elevated, but without EKG changes. She was transferred at the time to the Medical Center for admission. Echocardiogram was completed and normal. Vital signs remained normal. Troponin trended down. Pain improved and she was discharged home.

Around 6:30pm she came outside to get some fresh air, trying to feel normal &amp; got suddenly dizzy &amp; then fainted. Her body kind of, rocked. She came to, after she heard her sister, calling her name a few times. So she was out for less than a minute. But she&#39;s never fainted before!

                                                Technician (licensed to vaccinate) administered vaccine to patient near pharmacist.  20 seconds or so after administration, patient stated felt dizzy and immediately became unresponsive and head dropped to chest.  Technician stated he then lifted the patients head because he heard a &#34;snoring&#34; sound indicating airway may be constricted due to positioning.  Technician stated the patient&#39;s body twitched and became ridged, throwing her belongings. He called pharmacist (myself) for assistance. I immediately checked for breathing and pulse, both of which were evident.  I observed pt vitals for about 20 seconds before the pt opened her eyes and was responsive and able to talk to me.  Blood pressure was 120/69.  Pt remained in the pharmacy waiting area for 30 minutes after.  Patient said that in the past she has nearly passed out from piercings she has had, but has never fainted before and has no history of seizures.

                                                Around 9 AM, my daughter came downstairs and said her legs felt heavy. She sat down and then she said she was really hot. She was also sweating and pale. She said that she felt like she was about to pass out and that she couldn&#39;t see. She also said she couldn&#39;t focus, that she was seeing stars, and everything looked black. My husband and I told her to lay down on the couch. We gave her a rag to put on her head to cool her down and we got her some water to drink. She said she had a headache and we gave her some Tylenol.
