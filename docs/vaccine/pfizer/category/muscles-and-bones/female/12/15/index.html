Her eyes looked like they were glazed- not responding; didn&#39;t look bright. She got some water and an ice pack on her back and removed her shoes and put her feet up. After drinking the water and keeping the ice pack on for the rest of those 15 minutes. Nurses were there watching her. And she was able to walk out of the clinic on her own power. It had looked like she maybe would have passed out without the intervention of water, ice pack and getting her feet up.  She had muscle pain in her arm (of injection site)  that day and into the next day. The muscle pain in her arm lasted for about 24 hours.

                                                She was taking  Claritin for the few days before this event. She normally takes it every fall and every spring. She had seasonal allergy symptoms on the days leading up to this event- she had sore throat, runny nose, a little headache and congestion and developed a cough; on the day of this symptoms she spiked a low grade fever - 100.5. I did a rapid test for COVID at home which was negative for her. Sudden onset: A bunch of knives poking her on the inside of her stomach - pokey from hips to ribs.  She started to double over and bend over. Within 10 minutes, she couldn&#39;t stand up. She was telling me that something was really wrong. This isn&#39;t her character so I knew it was very wrong. I took her to ER. I was still concerned about appendicitis or COVID. This episode lasted for 90 minutes and then it came and went for the rest of the night and then after that - she had runny nose and congestion (normal allergies after that). She was better before they gave her the medication but it didn&#39;t seem like she really needed them. She was improving before she got either of the medications: Zofran; Levsin. They gave her a dosage of each there and  sent home with a prescription but we never had them filled as she was feeling better. - As it started to improve - it ( being the pokey pain) it was located closer to her ribs and breastbone.

That day she had headache, sore arm with earache and joint pain. Those symptoms continued for several days with some loose stools which lasted for two to three days with abdominal pain which persisted for a little over two weeks. We visited the doctor because of ear and throat pain and nausea. All tests were negative, but the symptoms improved slowly but they are totally resolved right now.

                                                Friday, 5/21 around 11:55 she received her first dose.  20 minutes later she complained that it felt like someone punched her in the face, and her left cheek was swelling.  She looked woozy, with her eyes closing, and the nurses laid her down on the floor on a mat.  Her tongue and throat began swelling, and she was having extreme difficulty breathing.  She then could not feel anything from her neck down, like she was paralyzed.  The nurse administered an Epipen and EMS showed up minutes later.  In the ambulance, EMS administered another Epipen, gave her a steroid and Benadryl and rushed her to the hospital.  Once at the ER, she was still having a hard time breathing, and could not feel anything from the waist down and could not move her legs.  She also complained about her spine being in extreme pain around the mid to lower back.  When her symptoms did not resolve, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment.  She had extreme pain in her joints - spine, hips, knees, ankles and toes, if someone tried to move them, she could not move on her own.  She also had tingling and numbness that would travel up and down her body - weakness in her arms and legs.  The medical staff continued with Bendryl - switched to Adderax, and Motrin and steroids (Prednisone?).  She was discharged from the hospital Sunday, 5/23/21 in the afternoon.  This morning (Monday 5/24/21) she is still experiencing back and leg pain, weakness and cannot walk with out assistance and it is extremely painful.

                                                On Sunday 5/23/2021 my daughter woke up to swelling, redness &amp; pain of the 1st metatarsal of her left foot.  One Monday 5/24/21 the swelling and symptoms in that region had resolved however throughout the day her right hand started to swell, become red and hurt.  This  the throughout the thumb and pointer finger region of her right hand.  The swelling and redness  spread further and could be seen on both palms just below the pointer finger as well as the top of her left foot.  A visit to the doctor was completed on Sunday evening 5/24/21.   The provider we saw believes it to be some for of reaction but it couldn&#39;t be determined if it was environmental, antibiotic or vaccine related.  She was given 2 Benadryl 25 mg tablets after the medical appointment.  As of this morning 5/25/21 I administered anther 25 mg Benadryl and instructed her to take a second dose around 11am at school.   She is reporting there is still swelling in her hand but it doesn&#39;t hurt as bad as it did yesterday.  Her PCP contacted my via phone today and is discussing her case with pediatric rheumatology as she also feels it could be a sign of allergic reaction but since much of the swelling is near joints she has reached out to them and I am waiting to hear back.

Patient reports that she does not frequently go running. Saturday, mom reports that patient was fatigued and rested most of the day. Sunday, she was up at 5am and was working by 6am until noon at the family restaurant. Her mother reports that it was very busy at the restaurant. Later in the afternoon on Sunday, the family went to their lake house in New Auburn, MN. Mother reports that the patient ate a good supper and the patient was asked to take the dog for a walk around 8pm. Patient took the dog for a walk for about 5 minutes, and then came back and went to her room, and her older sister found her lying in her room with her arms flexed and legs extended. Mom reports that she was drooling, staring and her muscles were stiff, and she wouldn&#39;t bear weight on her legs. This lasted approximately 10 minutes and she was transferred by ambulance to the Bloomer ER for evaluation.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

                                                I administered the vaccine, got one side of the band-aid on and that is when her head fell back.  Her eyes rolled into the back of her head; she then leaned over the right arm of the chair.  Her body stiffened next. I held her head and body with the help of a colleague.  This happened for about 10 seconds, then she woke up and snatched her mask off with a confused look on her face.  We asked her questions to see if she was aware. She was, then she went back out falling over to the side.  I called 911. When she awakened the second time after about 7-10 seconds her face turned pale.  We then moved her to the floor and propped her feet up.  Patient said she was nervous and felt like she had to use the restroom.  Her skin was clamy; patient said clamy skin is nothing new for her.  The fire truck and ambulance arrived on scene.  The workers began to assess patient.  Vitals were good. She did not go in the ambulance, but stated her vision were blurry.  She went home with grandparents.

A 14-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 (at the age of 14-years-old) as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced sharp pain in her neck and shoulder and her arm was hurting/ arm pain on 17May2021 night. The reporter was concerned because the pain appeared after a few days and not within 24-48 hours. She asked is this could be an indication that the vaccine was placed in the wrong place like not in the muscle. She asked if this is normal or when the patient should have this checked. The reporter stated that her and her husband did not experience any side effects. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Suddenly I looked up, I noticed her body stiffened and her eyes closed. she tumbled to the floor and hit her head on the ground. Paramedics were dispatched immediately.  patient woke up right away, we checked her pulse, forehead for fever, and back of her head for any possible bleeding.  She answered all questions that we asked of her correctly (such as her name, her age, etc.) Paramedics arrived, took her blood pressure, oxygen level (both normal), blood sugar (normal). Parents decided to take her to hospital for further evaluation.  I called and spoke to Dad 5 hours later, dad stated that she is doing fine.

                                                I have pictures I can upload. She had severe hives - flat, red rash on legs and arms. Very itchy; swollen ankles and swollen wrists and hands. She could barely  move her feet they were so swollen. That happened within 12 hours. And at the doctor&#39;s appt online, she said to give her a double dose an antihistamine - I think it was Zyrtec - and Benadryl at night and to be on Cortosteriod cream on the swollen parts. We did that for about three or four days until it was bearable and it stopped. About three days after it stopped  and she wasn&#39;t taking meds she had another break out - it almost looked  more like blisters - on torso and on arm. We did the same treatment with meds and cream and it went away within 24 hours. I showed to Pharmacist and the Pharmacist said to give an extra week for the next dose of vaccine to give body a chance to rest.

She then started feeling dizzy and looked like she was going to pass out and he caught her and he laid on her on the floor on a pillow.   There was a off-duty paramedic to assist her and they suggested to call 9-1-1 and they showed up 5-6 minutes later.  She was then taken to Hospital.  They ran a lot of laboratory tests, urinalysis and everything was negative.   Her white blood cell count was high and her URC&#39;s and UBC&#39;s were high.  Her albumin was also high.   She was then released from the ER and was told to FU with PCP within 2 days.  She is still having the symptoms of headache, sore throat, and achy bones, the typical flu-like side effects.   She is taking Tylenol for the symptoms, as well as cough drops for her throat.

She also felt tingling in both arms, both hands, her face, and torso; she also had a lot of pain in her back. She felt that her face was hot but to the touch it was not.  After about 20 minutes of these sensations her fingers cramped in gnarled positions that she was unable to straighten. Her right hand fingers was more rigid than her left.  This lasted about 30 minutes and then she was slowly able to straighten her fingers.  By the time she went to bed, around 10 pm, she felt basically back to normal.

We have had to continue alternating tylenol and advil since Saturday and she is unable to stand or walk for prolonged periods.

                                                The evening of the vaccine Maddison had slightly labored breathing, pins and needles feelings in feet and hands. Fever, body aches. The morning after while taking their temperature, Maddison said she couldn&#39;t see anything then fell into my arms. Her pupils quickly dilated, she made gutteral sounds while shaking slightly then lost consciousness. I couldn&#39;t see her breathing for about 15 seconds and she was confused when she came to. She couldn&#39;t hear, see or speak during the episode. We took her to the emergency room where a chest xray and ekg came back clear.
