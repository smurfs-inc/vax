Her eyes looked like they were glazed- not responding; didn&#39;t look bright. She got some water and an ice pack on her back and removed her shoes and put her feet up. After drinking the water and keeping the ice pack on for the rest of those 15 minutes. Nurses were there watching her. And she was able to walk out of the clinic on her own power. It had looked like she maybe would have passed out without the intervention of water, ice pack and getting her feet up.  She had muscle pain in her arm (of injection site)  that day and into the next day. The muscle pain in her arm lasted for about 24 hours.

                                                She was taking  Claritin for the few days before this event. She normally takes it every fall and every spring. She had seasonal allergy symptoms on the days leading up to this event- she had sore throat, runny nose, a little headache and congestion and developed a cough; on the day of this symptoms she spiked a low grade fever - 100.5. I did a rapid test for COVID at home which was negative for her. Sudden onset: A bunch of knives poking her on the inside of her stomach - pokey from hips to ribs.  She started to double over and bend over. Within 10 minutes, she couldn&#39;t stand up. She was telling me that something was really wrong. This isn&#39;t her character so I knew it was very wrong. I took her to ER. I was still concerned about appendicitis or COVID. This episode lasted for 90 minutes and then it came and went for the rest of the night and then after that - she had runny nose and congestion (normal allergies after that). She was better before they gave her the medication but it didn&#39;t seem like she really needed them. She was improving before she got either of the medications: Zofran; Levsin. They gave her a dosage of each there and  sent home with a prescription but we never had them filled as she was feeling better. - As it started to improve - it ( being the pokey pain) it was located closer to her ribs and breastbone.

That day she had headache, sore arm with earache and joint pain. Those symptoms continued for several days with some loose stools which lasted for two to three days with abdominal pain which persisted for a little over two weeks. We visited the doctor because of ear and throat pain and nausea. All tests were negative, but the symptoms improved slowly but they are totally resolved right now.

An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

She was evaluated in emergency room and found to have markedly elevated CPK to &gt;7000 and mildly elevated AST (195) and ALT (70),  and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and admitted to hospital where she was treated with IV fluids. Her CPK peaked at 11,400. She improved on IV fluids and was discharged home on 6/16. On follow up visit in clinic on 6/19 her CPK had improved to 1151, her liver enzymes were trending down and her symptoms were completely resolved. Hospitalist felt rhabdomyolysis was due to activity as patient had been training for a  black belt, but parents report no recent change in training schedule or intensity and concerned that this may be effect of vaccine given timing of onset of symptoms

                                                Friday, 5/21 around 11:55 she received her first dose.  20 minutes later she complained that it felt like someone punched her in the face, and her left cheek was swelling.  She looked woozy, with her eyes closing, and the nurses laid her down on the floor on a mat.  Her tongue and throat began swelling, and she was having extreme difficulty breathing.  She then could not feel anything from her neck down, like she was paralyzed.  The nurse administered an Epipen and EMS showed up minutes later.  In the ambulance, EMS administered another Epipen, gave her a steroid and Benadryl and rushed her to the hospital.  Once at the ER, she was still having a hard time breathing, and could not feel anything from the waist down and could not move her legs.  She also complained about her spine being in extreme pain around the mid to lower back.  When her symptoms did not resolve, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment.  She had extreme pain in her joints - spine, hips, knees, ankles and toes, if someone tried to move them, she could not move on her own.  She also had tingling and numbness that would travel up and down her body - weakness in her arms and legs.  The medical staff continued with Bendryl - switched to Adderax, and Motrin and steroids (Prednisone?).  She was discharged from the hospital Sunday, 5/23/21 in the afternoon.  This morning (Monday 5/24/21) she is still experiencing back and leg pain, weakness and cannot walk with out assistance and it is extremely painful.

                                                On Sunday 5/23/2021 my daughter woke up to swelling, redness &amp; pain of the 1st metatarsal of her left foot.  One Monday 5/24/21 the swelling and symptoms in that region had resolved however throughout the day her right hand started to swell, become red and hurt.  This  the throughout the thumb and pointer finger region of her right hand.  The swelling and redness  spread further and could be seen on both palms just below the pointer finger as well as the top of her left foot.  A visit to the doctor was completed on Sunday evening 5/24/21.   The provider we saw believes it to be some for of reaction but it couldn&#39;t be determined if it was environmental, antibiotic or vaccine related.  She was given 2 Benadryl 25 mg tablets after the medical appointment.  As of this morning 5/25/21 I administered anther 25 mg Benadryl and instructed her to take a second dose around 11am at school.   She is reporting there is still swelling in her hand but it doesn&#39;t hurt as bad as it did yesterday.  Her PCP contacted my via phone today and is discussing her case with pediatric rheumatology as she also feels it could be a sign of allergic reaction but since much of the swelling is near joints she has reached out to them and I am waiting to hear back.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

The nurse gave her an EpiPen and called a ambulance. Her whole body was shaking, probably from the EpiPen, like almost convulsing. She said that they got her onto the ambulance and her daughter was having trouble breathing. They gave her another dose of an EpiPen in the ambulance. They also gave her daughter a steroid and some Benadryl through an IV. Her daughter was rushed to the ER, having a hard time breathing and complaining she could not feel anything from the waist down. Caller said that her daughter was also complaining of numbness and tingling all over. She also started to complain about extreme pain in her back. When they would touch her hips, toes, spine, ankles, and knees she would complain of extreme pain, like joint pain. Her daughter had numbness from waist down. If they touched her foot she could not feel it. Her daughter was admitted to the hospital and got released yesterday 23May2021. She is still experiencing pain and numbness. The numbness is from the waist down and the tingling was up and down her arms. She said that her daughter was very weak and could not feed herself. They had to give her several albuterol breathing treatments in the hospital because her chest was tight. She was not wheezing, but they could tell it was constricted and treated her with Albuterol.  She said that her daughter still cannot walk without assistance this morning. She was treated with Motrin, Benadryl and Atarax, and Prednisone in the hospital.

No more dizziness, color was back in her cheeks, was able to eat and left for school.

Her eyes rolled into the back of her head; she then leaned over the right arm of the chair.  Her body stiffened next. I held her head and body with the help of a colleague.  This happened for about 10 seconds, then she woke up and snatched her mask off with a confused look on her face.  We asked her questions to see if she was aware. She was, then she went back out falling over to the side.  I called 911. When she awakened the second time after about 7-10 seconds her face turned pale.  We then moved her to the floor and propped her feet up.  Patient said she was nervous and felt like she had to use the restroom.  Her skin was clamy; patient said clamy skin is nothing new for her.  The fire truck and ambulance arrived on scene.  The workers began to assess patient.  Vitals were good. She did not go in the ambulance, but stated her vision were blurry.  She went home with grandparents.

A 14-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 (at the age of 14-years-old) as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced sharp pain in her neck and shoulder and her arm was hurting/ arm pain on 17May2021 night. The reporter was concerned because the pain appeared after a few days and not within 24-48 hours. She asked is this could be an indication that the vaccine was placed in the wrong place like not in the muscle. She asked if this is normal or when the patient should have this checked. The reporter stated that her and her husband did not experience any side effects. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Suddenly I looked up, I noticed her body stiffened and her eyes closed. she tumbled to the floor and hit her head on the ground. Paramedics were dispatched immediately.  patient woke up right away, we checked her pulse, forehead for fever, and back of her head for any possible bleeding.  She answered all questions that we asked of her correctly (such as her name, her age, etc.) Paramedics arrived, took her blood pressure, oxygen level (both normal), blood sugar (normal). Parents decided to take her to hospital for further evaluation.  I called and spoke to Dad 5 hours later, dad stated that she is doing fine.

She could barely  move her feet they were so swollen. That happened within 12 hours. And at the doctor&#39;s appt online, she said to give her a double dose an antihistamine - I think it was Zyrtec - and Benadryl at night and to be on Cortosteriod cream on the swollen parts. We did that for about three or four days until it was bearable and it stopped. About three days after it stopped  and she wasn&#39;t taking meds she had another break out - it almost looked  more like blisters - on torso and on arm. We did the same treatment with meds and cream and it went away within 24 hours. I showed to Pharmacist and the Pharmacist said to give an extra week for the next dose of vaccine to give body a chance to rest.

A 14-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder on 23May2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. Family history was reported as none, they were basically a healthy family. Patient was not vaccinated within 4 weeks and no additional Vaccines administered on same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. On 23May2021, the patient experienced extreme weakness in her arms and legs, really bad cough, on an unspecified date in May2021, she had severe pain in her legs and on an unspecified date in 2021, she was not been feeling well. Patient&#39;s father called on behalf of his 14-year-old daughter who received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine about two weeks ago and had extreme weakness in arms and legs, 2 weeks ago, on Sunday 23May2021. She had not been to school since then, she went for a couple hours and then they send her back. His daughter also said that it had been painful but caller states that he does not know exactly what his daughter means by that, she said that her legs hurt her, that started probably 24May2021 or 25May2021 with the bad cough also and not been feeling well. Had all leveled out the past 10 days. Had blood work and the results came back Friday. Thought there was an outside chance based on the blood work that it was strep related. Her doctor had suggested that the parents call Pfizer to see if this type of reaction had been reported in her age group after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She never really had a fever. This started the day after the vaccine, and they are not sure if it was related to the vaccine or not. A couple of results were off. The Streptolysins were 468. The antinuclear antibodies were 1 to 160, which was off. Everything else was negative. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included antinuclear antibody: 1 to 160, streptococcus test: 468. Patient received therapeutic measure to treat adverse events, they tried Amoxicillin, which had no impact, they thought maybe it was just a virus. They also tried Tylenol and Advil, which also had no impact. Stated that the Amoxicillin was 875mg twice a day and that the Tylenol and Advil were from different packages lying around the house. Patient was scheduled for the second dose this coming Sunday but they were holding off until she was better. The outcome of events was unknown.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On sunday night, about 36 hours after vaccination, she started to have numbness of her lower jaw and tongue. She started to have an incredible amount of drooling and could not swallow. She then started to have epigastric cramping and sharp abdominal pain that moved into the right lower quadrant. She had pretty severe headache that started the same time as numbness and drooling with photosensitivity. No fever. No vomiting but she was nauseous.  she went to the ER late on 6/13.  She was then transferred to the hospital for furthur care. She had a neurology consult that thought perhaps her headache, numbness and drooling could have been an atypical migraine-this resolved as of 6/14.  Her abdominal pain resolved after appendectomy and now she just has muscular pain related to surgery.

She then started feeling dizzy and looked like she was going to pass out and he caught her and he laid on her on the floor on a pillow.   There was a off-duty paramedic to assist her and they suggested to call 9-1-1 and they showed up 5-6 minutes later.  She was then taken to Hospital.  They ran a lot of laboratory tests, urinalysis and everything was negative.   Her white blood cell count was high and her URC&#39;s and UBC&#39;s were high.  Her albumin was also high.   She was then released from the ER and was told to FU with PCP within 2 days.  She is still having the symptoms of headache, sore throat, and achy bones, the typical flu-like side effects.   She is taking Tylenol for the symptoms, as well as cough drops for her throat.

She also felt tingling in both arms, both hands, her face, and torso; she also had a lot of pain in her back. She felt that her face was hot but to the touch it was not.  After about 20 minutes of these sensations her fingers cramped in gnarled positions that she was unable to straighten. Her right hand fingers was more rigid than her left.  This lasted about 30 minutes and then she was slowly able to straighten her fingers.  By the time she went to bed, around 10 pm, she felt basically back to normal.

                                                About an hour after receiving the 2nd vaccine, she developed a pain in the upper-mid sternal area.  She&#39;s not had any pain like this in the past.  The pain remained constant ever since it started, and there don&#39;t appear to be any alleviating factors such as position changes.  Deep inspiration makes it worse.  The pain radiates at times across the upper chest and down the back.  She&#39;s had some accompanying nausea.  She&#39;s also noticed feeling a little short of breath as the day progressed, which is not necessarily related to the pain.  She denies any palpitations or dizziness.  No near syncope or syncope.  The pain remained  a maximum intensity of 10/10. She therefore presented to the ER. Diagnostic studies including labs, EKG and a CT pulmonary angiogram were performed.  Troponin returned as elevated, but without EKG changes. She was transferred at the time to the Medical Center for admission. Echocardiogram was completed and normal. Vital signs remained normal. Troponin trended down. Pain improved and she was discharged home.

                                                Woke up with chills, muscle pain through out whole body, fatigued and just flu like feeling. Felt like that, all day. Around 6:30pm she came outside to get some fresh air, trying to feel normal &amp; got suddenly dizzy &amp; then fainted. Her body kind of, rocked. She came to, after she heard her sister, calling her name a few times. So she was out for less than a minute. But she&#39;s never fainted before!
