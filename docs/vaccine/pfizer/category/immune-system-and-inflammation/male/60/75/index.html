She diagnosed &#34;Swollen sub-mandibular &amp; pre-auricular lymphatic nodes.&#34;  I am being treated with: 1) Erythromycin Ophth Oint 3.5GM 2) Prednisolone AC 1% Ophth Susp 5ML 3) Pataday  Doctor believes that my viral infection might be a result of the Covid 19 vaccine, and gives assurance that her treatment will resolve issues. She is unsure whether, or not, I am considered contagious during this time? Inquiries at the college were unfruitful.   I hope my reporting this is not a violation in any way. Many thanks.

A 60-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER6208) as single dose at the age of 60-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included disability. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced losing strength in his right leg in Mar2021, his leg kept getting worse in 2021, he just can not walk anymore in 2021, leg is swollen in 2021, muscle pain in Mar2021 with, joint pain in Mar2021, muscle spasms in his neck because he has neck pain too in 2021.   The events losing strength in his right leg, his leg kept getting worse, he just can not walk anymore and leg is swollen were assessed medically significant. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging: leg is swollen in 2021, X-ray: nothing showed up in 2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of losing strength in his right leg, muscle pain, joint pain.  The course of events was as follows:  Around 21 Mar2021 or 22Mar2021, he had problems with his leg. Patient was experiencing muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg. Patient stated that was a problem. Patient had an MRI and X-ray that looked to see what the problem was. Patient received second dose on 14Apr2021. Patient hasn&#39;t even seen his prescribing Healthcare Professional yet, until Monday. He hasn&#39;t worked in five years, he&#39;s been on disability. He wanted to get off disability so he went and got a job. He started the job 28Mar2021 and everyday, his leg kept getting worse. He had to leave the job the other day because he just cant walk anymore, he has to do a lot of walking on the job. He called the doctor and told them something was wrong with his leg, they took an x-ray and nothing showed up. They did an MRI and all it shows was that his leg was swollen, no bones or nothing is broken. He was looking at Pfizer paperwork that a facility gave him and the two of symptoms are on there, so this problem was related to the vaccine. He never hurt his right leg, never had a problem until he got this shot. He was losing all his strength in his right leg, all the pain. They have been giving muscle relaxers and ibuprofen and they did not seem to work or be doing anything. First, he went to the emergency room and they gave him Ibuprofen 600 mg tablets and they gave him Cyclobenzaprine 10mg tablets. They said that he was experiencing muscle spasms in his neck because he has neck pain too. So he made an appointment with his family doctor, which there was no openings and had to see another PA. He did not know the HCP last name, but he/she was a PA in the office and he saw him/her, who requested the x-ray, and he had the x-ray done and saw him/her again and nothing showed up so he/she requested an MRI. He went to the hospital to have that and nothing showed up except his leg was swollen. Now they are going to send him to a bone specialist, but there was no reason to because now he stated he knew what was causing this. Patient took Cyclobenzaprine, 10 mg, three times a day by mouth. He states it did not seem to do nothing. Patient verified it was a prescription from the pharmacy:  NDC: 0137517-19674, unsure of LOT, expiry date. The quantity of the first bottle was 15 but he went through that already and he got a new bottle that has 42 in it. This current bottle he has 12 or 13 left. The first bottle was completely gone. Patient took Baclofen 5mg tablets, three times a day: morning, noon, and night. They were not doing anything either, well he did not think they are. Patient provided NDC: 0135391-19674. The first muscle relaxer they gave him, the 10mg one, he took it that day, it knocked him out. Caller states when he saw his doctor, he said he can not take that one while he works, he will take it at night time, so that is why the doctor gave him the other muscle relaxer, Baclofen, to take while he worked during the day. He took one muscle relaxer at night of one kind and the other kind he takes the ones that won&#39;t take him out as much. Patient stated that he had to leave his job because he cannot do it, he cannot walk. Patient took Ibuprofen (NDC: 0139246-19674, to use before 22Apr2022) 600mg, by mouth, three times a day. He took one with the muscle relaxers. Patient took verified all medications Cyclobenzaprine; Baclofen; Ibuprofen were prescriptions from the pharmacy. The outcome of muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg, his leg kept getting worse, was not recovered of he just can not walk anymore on, leg is swollen, neck pain was unknown. Reporter seriousness for muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg and neck pain was unspecified Patient received his second dose of Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine (LOT: EW0161, unsure if ER or EW) on 14Apr2021.  A Product Complaint was filed.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK5780) in  left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (worked in surgical ICU and was over 61 years old).  Medical history included Pre-diabetic. Family history included: mother died; mother&#39;s side had colon cancer and grandparents and uncles had cardiovascular diseases.Concomitant medication included exenatide (BYDUREON), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), omeprazole (PROTONIX), hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and pneumococcal vaccine on 08Dec2020 and tetanus vaccine on 08Dec2020.  It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell&#39;s Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Bell&#39;s palsy, Lacrimation increased  and vision blurred due to temporal relationship.  However,  the Bell&#39;s palsy may likely possibly  represent concurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including head CT/MRI and viral serologies, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The next day when he took a shower, and when he went to wash under his armpit was very swollen, and very tender.   He put some ice on it which did not help the swelling.  It bothers him when his T-shirt touches the area, so he tried to wear a regular shirt.  He also had achy pain in his back, weakness in his arms, sore throat and a little cough, no fever.  The armpit still hurts and is still swollen.  Other than the ice he did not take anything else as he takes a lot of medications as it is.  He has not called his doctor because it happened over the weekend, but is going to call her today.   He did have a COVID test yesterday drive through facility at the community hospital as he has a surgery coming up, and they were going to call him if it was positive.  He is scheduled for surgery on his right knee on Thursday.

Medical history included blood clot after a back fusion about 16 years ago (2005), and had a knee replacement 3 months before the vaccine (Dec2020). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took ANCEF [cefazolin sodium] and had allergies; and oxacillin which the patient had allergies and hepatitis. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior to vaccination nor was he tested for covid since vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to Covid vaccine.  It was reported that the day the patient received the first vaccine his calf, foot, and knee swelled up by evening. It stayed swollen for a week and he went to see his doctor. He did an ultrasound on his calf and found a deep blood clot. He was now on blood thinners. He mentioned that he had a knee replacement 3 months before the vaccine but it was progressing fine. Usually blood clots occur after surgery within a 2 week period. He had a blood clot after a back fusion about 16 years ago. He was reporting this because his doctor was not sure why he got the blood clot and it coincided with the vaccine.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included ultrasound scan: found a deep blood clot  in Mar2021. The events started on 17Mar2021 18:30 with outcome of recovering. The events resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result the events with LOVANOX and PRADAXA.  Follow-up attempts are completed.

                                                I started to develop a headache and became a little nauseous right after. After two days, my fingers started swelling and hurting. I couldn&#39;t make a fist. It caused my immune system to go crazy. That lasted about 5 days. After taking Aleve and Tylenol, it helped reduce the pain. My kidney doctor told me to stop taking Aleve because it was interacting with my BP meds. The doctor from Northwest Arthritis prescribed Tramadol to help with pain. I still have pain, but it&#39;s tolerable.

                                                Received vaccine in the morning 08:00 am, took acetaminophen 1 GM at 09:00 am due to pain in arm.  By 10:30pm, I began having flu like symptoms, (aches, low grade fever, sinus symptoms) took another acetaminophen 1 GM.  At 11:00 pm, developed severe rigors that lasted for approximately 2 hours. I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.

                                                One week after getting the first Pfizer vaccine, my superficial vein thrombosis returned with a vengeance. I had gotten the vein ablation treatment several years ago for varicose veins, and the problems I had went away, but one week after the first shot, my calf muscle was swollen and felt sore and aching, and the rest of the leg was in pain, just like it was before getting the vein operation. The varicose veins returned and my leg now has prominent black and blue areas on it, like it had before my surgery. I&#39;m returning to the vein clinic in two weeks for them to look at it. My leg still hurts.   I should also add that my arm is still sore where they gave me the shot. My strength has not yet fully returned, even though I work out in the gym regularly.

                                                Developed Guillian Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant; Bell&#39;s palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 65-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, lot number was not reported), intramuscular, on 08Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. He received the vaccine at a school/student health clinic. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. He did not receive any other vaccines 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162B2. Medical history included hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, both were from unspecified dates and ongoing. Concomitant medications included ramipril (ALTACE) for hypertension, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for hypercholesterolemia, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), loratadine (LORATIDINE), evolocumab (REPATHA) for hypercholesterolemia. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, lot number was not reported), intramuscular, on 18Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunisation, at the age of 65-year-old. It was reported that patient developed Guillian Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant 10 days (as reported) after receiving the 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine on 18Jan2021. He lost the ability to use his hands/legs. He received 2 g/kg of IVIG over 4 days starting on 21Jan2021. At the time of initial report (02Mar2021), he was recovering in an inpatient rehab center. The patient also experienced Bell&#39;s Palsy on 24Jan2021. The patient further reported that all started with a headache on 18Jan2021 and then he began to lose the ability to use his hands and legs. So, he visited the ER (emergency room) on 20Jan2021 and got hospitalized. On 22Jan2021, he was completely unable to walk. On 24Jan2021, he was also diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy which was still ongoing at the time of report. The patient stated that he just got out of the inpatient rehab center on 03Mar2021. At the time of follow-up report (04Mar2021), he stated that he feels better but it is not recovered yet. The patient had undergone laboratory tests and procedures on 20Jan2021 which includes: Blood test: normal, Urine test: normal, CR Protein: elevated, Covid19 test: negative, CT (computer tomography) Scan: normal, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): normal. It was reported that adverse event Guillain Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant required visit to ER. The patient was hospitalized for Guillian Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant from 20Jan2021 to 03Mar2021. The patient received treatment for Guillian Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant, while he did not receive any treatment for Bell&#39;s palsy. Outcome of the event Guillian Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant was recovering, while outcome of Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered.   Information on batch/lot number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, a possible contribution of the drug to the events  Guillian Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant and Bell&#39;s palsy cannot be excluded.

A 65-year-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular on 24Jan2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was hospital.  Medical history included &#39;Cryptogenic cirrhosis s/p liver tx 20Jun2020, T2DM on insulin, Factor V Leiden, CAD s/p stent x3 (2008), hyperlipidemia&#39;, NSAIDS allergy. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), carvedilol, citalopram, ergocalciferol, insulin glargine (LANTUS), melatonin, metformin, omeprazole, senna alexandrina (SENNA).  The patient previously took atorvastatin and experienced Allergies to Atorvastatin, promethazine and experienced Allergies to promethazine, tolmetin and experienced Allergies to tolmetin, INSULIN for T2DM (Type 2 diabetes mellitus). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Bilateral lower extremity weakness and pain and paresthesia in bilateral hands and legs on 26Jan2021.

His lumbar puncture showed no WBC and significantly increased protein to 107 in 2021. This is all consistent with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP or Guillain Barre Syndrome) likely secondary to COVID vaccination given temporal association in 2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lumbar puncture: no WBC and significantly increased protein to 107 in 2021, neurological examination: areflexia throughout, patchy weakness in RLE &gt; LLE and B/L CN 7 weakness on 10Feb2021, Rapid SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) by PCR Nasopharyngeal swab on M4 (NASO): negative on 06Feb2021, skin test: decreased sensation on 10Feb2021. The adverse events result in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Hospitalization for all the events. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events (IVIg). The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, patient developed signs and symptoms which were consistent with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP or Guillain Barre Syndrome) likely secondary to COVID vaccination given temporal association.

I called a tele doc service on Sunday, 02/14/2021, they prescribed Amoxicillin -Clav.  Temperature and swelling went away, still having difficulty hearing in that ear.

On 3/18, he fell to the floor and could not get up. He was admitted to the hospital for sepsis, pneumonia, and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, treated on IV antibiotics and discharged on PO antibiotics. His home insulin was also decreased but continued to have hypoglycemic to hyperglycemic events. Insulin was decreased in clinic afterward and was compliant on antibiotics. Returned to hospital again a few days later for sepsis and pneumonia/effusion. He later went to a nursing facility / on hospice. He ultimately required supplemental oxygen and breathing increasingly became labored. Patient ultimately died on 4/9/21.

This went away after a few hours but when it started I thought of Bell&#39;s Palsy.  - Later my arm got extremely sore at the site of the injection it still hurts and in a large area of the arm 5 days later - Painful area below the left armpit and in an area about 3 inches in diameter (area of the lymph node). Still have pain although less after 4 days.

The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included high blood pressure and cholesterol both from an unknown date. The patient had known allergies. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number was not reported), administered in left arm on 28Jan2021 06:00 PM (at the age of 66-years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Concomitant medications included losartan potassium (LOSARTIN); rosuvastatin; alfuzosin; and potassium; all were taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. A month after 2nd dose, started having daily fever with fatigue and dry harsh cough. This has continued for 4 weeks and in third week developed severe bilateral edema feet and legs. Then, the calf skin turned red, hot and tender; all on 12Mar2021 14:00 (as reported). All medical reports have come back normal and doctors were unable to diagnose the root cause which is why the patient suspected the Pfizer COVID vaccine may have caused this adverse reaction. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized for 5 days. Therapeutic measures were taken in response to the events as patient received Tylenol, Antibiotic and steroid. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Two days after vaccination had swelling in both wrists and both hands and fingers. Seeming arthritic condition. Never had any type of arthritis or swelling of hands or wrists. Slight pain in hands and inability to grip or hold items. First took acemetacin for several days with no relief. then tried normal aspirin for several days. After two weeks someone suggested taking ibuprofen. I took 200mg per day and found slight relief. Contacted my PCP on 2/28/2021 to request a video visit that occurred on 3/3/2021 at 8:00 am. Doctor agreed that swelling and arthritic condition was the result of vaccination and advised to take 600 mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours for a week. Have had some relief from this medication. Doctor advised not to take the second vaccination shot.

Thereafter in about 24 hours the dermatitis erupted again and he developed hand swelling, redness and itching.  he consulted his physician and was given oral prednisone at 50mg /d for 7 days which calmed the dermatitis.  We reviewed the possibility of his rash erupting again after he receives dose 32--for which he is here today--and the possibility that the previous corticosteroids that he was given might inhibit a full immune response from the vaccine.  He opts to receive the second dose today anyway and it is administered.  This is to report the worsening of the dermatitis after the first dose was given.  He still had remnants of a dermatitis (wrinkled skin, etc)

I&#39;m pretty sure it was the vaccine because i had not been anywhere that weekend and had not  put my hands on anything unusual that i don&#39;t normally touch. It only happened to my hands. Other than that i had minor flu like symtoms from the shot,  achiness and slight fatigue feeling. I had an ER doctor look at my hands when i went in today to get help for my bronchitis, which i had some before the covid shot. It got worse on Monday. He perscribed prednisone which has pretty much taken the hand spots away..i was tested negative for covid today(1/19/21) by the way.

                                                My feet had been tired and sore from standing and working a lot anyway but seemed to be calming down. About 24-36 hours after the first injection noticed pain in the ball of my left foot.  Shortly after that swelling began in both feet.  Swelling became worse, doctors conclusion was metatarsalgia. Rest, ice, ibuprofen. Swelling got worse on Friday Jan 29, went to emergency at hospital. Diagnosis was nueroma, given a prescription for prednisone.  Began Prednisone Saturday Jan 30.  Swelling began to subside on Sunday evening. Has been improvement slightly throughout the week but still has not gone down.  Small pockets of dried blood are pooling the bottom of my feet where the swelling was the worst.

He reports that after about 1.5 hours the swelling resolved.

                                                I am an internal medicine provider and have an 18-year h/o rheumatoid arthritis that had been well-controlled for years allowing me to stop treatment with MTX/leucovorin 3 years ago.   On 2/28/021 I developed pain, erythema, warmth and swelling at the 4th MCP in my L hand which persisted for several days.  I contacted my rheumatologist, and saw him on 03/04.  Since this was my first episode of inflammation in years, we elected to treat it conservatively with naproxen OTC.  My symptoms resolved after several days, but then I had successive episodes of pain, erythema, warmth and swelling in my R 5th MCP, R ankle, L 5th TMT, L 5th MCP, L knee and R wrist over the next 3 weeks--- in the pattern of palindromic rheumatism similar to that my symptoms had first began 18 years ago.  Given the number and severity of these episodes, doctor recommended treatment with prednisone 10mg PO qdaily for 30 days and restarting MTX 15mg (six 2.5mg tabs) PO qweekly  and folate 1mg PO qdaily.

                                                When I received vaccine I had a uri/sinusitis illness without fever.  One day later I had body aches, chills, headache, no fever, these symptoms lasted 2.5 weeks.  2 days after receiving vaccine I had scrotal and ankle edema and a 3 kg weight gain that lasted 5 days.   I also developed a worsening of uri and cough symptoms, which now 3 weeks later are slowly resolving

                                                12 hours following the injection I developed a severe anaphylactic reaction including extreme swelling of lips, tongue, soft palate; difficulty breathing when reclined; difficulty swallowing and difficulty speaking coherently. My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

                                                Slight swelling of toes (first on right foot and ca. one week later of a couple on left foot) accompanied by blotchy appearance and tenderness and inflammation. Blistering sort of phenomenon (although no open sores). Looks the same as what I see on internet as &#34;COVID-toes&#34;, although I&#39;ve not seen any sign of it as a reaction to the vaccine itself.

                                                On Jan 27, 20021, I fell and have a displaced fragment of the 5th metacarpal base.  About 34 hours after my shot, I started feeling discomfort from my fracture.  By 36 hours I had great discomfort and pain with some swelling.  More pain than with the original fracture /fall.  Talked with vaccine hotline at around 36 hours after shot.   They advised I talk with Doctor.  I did call doctor.  He advised elevation, two ibuprofen and on Tylenol every 4 to 6 hours.  I did that.  Now 48 hours out from shot, extreme pain gone; Have swelling and discomfort.  Only took two rounds of ibuprofen and Tylenol.

                                                I woke up with slightly itchy, severe skin rash on 2/23/2021 following second vaccine injection at 10:58 am on 2/21/2021. The rash completely covered both buttocks, the  top front inside of both thighs, both hips, the front groin area, inside/bottom of both feet. Given the extent and intensity of rash, it must have started on Monday 2/22/2021. The rash was red-purple with white spots (perhaps hives).   I contacted my primary care physician&#39;s office on 2/23/2021 and had a televisit with the nurse. Her diagnosis was Allergic Dermatitis/Itching. She prescribed Banophen (50 mg), Triamcinolone cream, and Cetirizine HCL (10 mg). I took the medicine.  Continued below.

Then developed adenopathy in  anterior cervical chain of neck. This expanded and pushed against Portocath in lot IJ. On Feb 22, 2021 a CT was preformed that showed several nodes in the neck, largest 4.5 cm, as well as 2.5 cm in rt axilla. No hilar adenopathy. The large node enlarged to 7.5 cm and was biopsied on Apr 9, 2021. The report came back that this is a malignant transformation of Marginal Zone Lymphoma to Large B-cell Lymphoma.

Allergy consulted due to anaphylactic reaction several hours after procedure. Patient was stable on RA at time of presentation and vitals were normal and stable during the procedure from 8-9 AM. Procedure log reviewed. He received fentanyl, versed, heparin, omnipaque, and xylocaine during the procedure. No immediate reactions noted and no change in vitals during procedure. He tolerated procedure well and was transferred to the cardiac recovery room on RA with normal vitals.   At 1217, patient received percocet and at 1 PM, desaturations noted on flowsheets (84% from RA). Noted pain level of 10/10. HR increased to 130s-150s and BP did drop as low as 99/87. Per notes, he developed shortness of breath, rash, and itching with this. Given albuterol, racemic epinephrine, diphenhydramine IV, famotidine IV, and solumedrol. After developing nausea, he was given IM epinephrine at 2:10 pm. Then, symptoms rapidly improved and he was transferred to CVICU. He was shortly weaned from BIPAP (briefly hypercarbic) to nasal cannula and eventually 1-2L NC.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old male patient with a complex medical history with multiple problems and cancers and debilities.  He received a second dose of COVID vaccine yesterday about midday.  Shortly thereafter, he started having shivers and shakes.  The concern that I had when he called the office was a possible bacteremia.  He was sensitive emergency room for evaluation.  He was noting that he was chilled and was unable to get warm. He said his temperature was up to 100.5.  He had generalized weakness and inability to get up and walk and had malaise.  He has no known exposures to pneumonia or other illnesses.  He has basically been homebound for the past year with the COVID.  He was evaluated in the emergency room and found to have an elevated white blood cell count on the right upper lobe pneumonia on portable chest x-ray.  Blood cultures and urine culture were obtained since he had a urine abnormality as well.  The patient was admitted to observation while we wait on cultures and we treat the pneumonia with antibiotics.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

This consumer reported similar event for 3 patients (for herself, her husband and their doctor). This is 1st of three reports (husband case) and only this case is serious. A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Feb2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and blood pressure abnormal; both from 2007 and ongoing; about 13-14 years, he does not take insulin, he takes oral medication. The consumer is calling for her husband who is in the hospital. His symptoms started after Covid 19 injection. He suddenly, out of nowhere, got a terrible, terrible pain in the middle of his stomach, it doubles him over, and he broke out in sweats and this was Saturday, 27Feb2021, in the morning. The sweating went away but the pain continued and continued. He went to urgent care on 27Feb2021 they thought he was constipated and was treated for constipation. The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn&#39;t been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don&#39;t know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband&#39;s nurse. When querying weight caller states he&#39;s lost 10 pounds, he&#39;s 142 pounds if he&#39;s lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn&#39;t feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t help the pain. He was also given a &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, asked caller what was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don&#39;t look at the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; it&#39;s kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those &#34;codone&#34; medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband&#39;s and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband&#39;s sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn&#39;t said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn&#39;t think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn&#39;t a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There&#39;s more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he&#39;s there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn&#39;t get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible terrible stomach pain and bug in his colon. Events terrible terrible stomach pain, bug in his colon, broke out in sweats, feeling warm was recovering, event vomiting 5 times was recovered on 27Feb2021, event nausea was recovered on 01Mar2021, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021253476 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021253512 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient

                                                I got my 1st Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination on 3/4/2021. No real adverse effects immediately - just a little sore right arm at the injection site and a watery, runny nose a day or so later that eventually stopped. I have allergies so I&#39;m used to the runny nose symptom. However, on Monday evening, March 15, I noticed some slight pain where my lymph nodes are located underneath my jaw and close to my ear on the right side. There was a small lump that was tender to the touch, about the size of a small raisin or grape, under my jaw along my neck on the right side. To a much lesser extent, and barely noticeable, in a similar location, on my left side as well. I went to my primary care physician the next day, 3/16, who confirmed that I had swollen lymph nodes - and also told me they could notice them further down my neck as well, which I was not aware of previously. I had no other symptoms, e.g., no temperature, etc. They said that, yes, the swollen lymph nodes appeared to be consistent with earlier reports of swollen lymph nodes as a resulting side effect in some patients following a Covid19 vaccination, but also mentioned that often, this side effect was more noticeable several days after the vaccination. Since my swollen lymph nodes occurred nearly 10 days later, my PCP team said to go ahead and get the 2nd Pfizer vaccination as scheduled 3/25/21, but to return to their office two weeks later for another checkup to make sure there weren&#39;t any other issues going on.

In 2021, the patient experienced infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy and whole left side of face and eye swollen. On 02Mar2021, the patient experienced felt weakness and chills. On 08Apr2021, the patient experienced substantial bubble of pus under arm. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit. In Apr2021, the substantial bubble of pus under arm resolved. On unknown dates, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears and whole left side of face and eye swollen resolved. Covid-19 vaccine was also considered suspect. In Feb2021, the patient saw his physician twice for an ear infection. On 01Mar2021, the patient got his first vaccine shot. The next day he had chills and fever and feeling of weakness the next day. He went away after a short time and he felts better. He went to the physician twice in the past two weeks for minor infections especially in his ears. The tissue inside his ear dried up and bleeding. On the first visit he had a fever due to the infection in the ear. His physician prescribed antibiotic for a week. He got another infection in the same ears. He was painful when touched it. He went back to physician and physician prescribed another anitbiotic. The physician said the infections were to be expected with Humira because Humira weakens immune system. Partly because of his age. His age may be a contributing factor as well. He agrees to have physician contacted. On 29Mar2021 to 1Apr2021, he was in the hospital his infection started in his ear lobe that migrated to his whole left side of his face. His eye was swollen and felt pain on top of his head. His Temp of 105 when he went in. The patient was given intravenous antibiotics. He was tested to make sure infection had not spread to blood or bones. The Humira might have played a role because it lowers the bodies resistance to infection. They asked him not to take the Humira for two Saturdays. He did not take Humira on 09Apr2021 or before. He was stable. His skin was cracking up. Thought it might be shingles. He was prescribed an oral antibiotic first time, but then a week and a half later, it acted up again and he went back and got a different antibiotic and that worked until it. He was feeling completely better since he got out of the hospital. He had more energy than he had in a while. He had been feeling low energy for a while due to the infection. His physician did not think he should stop taking Humira but if he got a fever he needs to investigate immediately to see if he needs to hospitalized. In 08Apr2021, he had substantial bubble of puss under his arm. He gave him a steroid injection to control that. On 10Apr2021, he had thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of his armpit and he thinks that was the end of it. On 11Apr2021, he had his second Covid vaccine manufactured by Moderna then after he was released from the hospital. He was no issues or reactions with either injection. He was careful when he went out around people. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. The action taken in response to the events adalimumab was not applicable. The outcome of event infection in ear lobe, eye swelling and swelling face recovered in 2021, weakness and chills and fever recovered in Mar2021, ear infection and pain localised recovered on unspecified date, Axillary abscess/substantial bubble of puss under arm recovered in Apr2021; event ear bleeding was recovering; event fluid discharge, skin fissures and shingles was unknown.  The reporter&#39;s causality for adalimumab (Humira) on the events infection in ear lobe, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset with Humira (Adalimumab) was a reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of felt weakness and chills with Humira (Adalimumab) was no reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, skin was cracking up and possible shingles was not provided.  Opinion is that there is a reasonable possibility that the events of infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab). Opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of felt weakness, chills, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset and tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pfizer comment: The serious events Ear lobe infection and Condition aggravated were considered as unlikely related to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. A possible contributory role of BNT162b2 cannot be completely excluded for the non-serious asthenia, pyrexia and chills, which occurred in a close temporal relation, namely, one day after the  first dose BNT162B2 injection. The other reported events were confirmed as non-serious, while the causality was confounded by ADALIMUMAB administration. The infectious events were to be expected with co-suspect due an immunosuppression activity with increased infection susceptibility, such as Herpes zoster and Ear lobe infection aggravated, in this case. Furthermore, swelling face and eye swollen with unknown onset in 2021 may be attributable to the co-suspect and unrelated to the vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A male patient of an unspecified age received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Lot Number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 13Mar2021, single for the prevention of corona virus. Medical history included high blood pressure and allergy to penicillin both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s fiance and the patient took their first Pfizer Covid shot on 13March2021 and within 4 minutes the patient started showing symptoms of everything. The patient had his shot on his left arm, his whole left side of his body went numb. He was asked &#34;are you allergic to anything&#34; and he said he cannot have Penicillin. The reporter stated that event on the day of the report, the patient still has the numbness down in his foot, his toe and on his left side but also originally within 4 minutes he was sat down and also within 12 minutes he was throwing up and they could not figure out what was wrong, he did &#34;fall on the ground&#34; (as reported, not further clarified). The patient was experiencing, not as strong but still experiencing, tingly and shingles and originally was numb. The patient is concerned about it. The patient only took the first one because that was on the Saturday and on Monday he went to the doctor and the doctor suggested to not take the second one because his blood pressure turned dropping, he does have the blood pressure and it was 107/70. The reporter said that the patient has allergy and since of that all he had anaphylactic reaction because he is allergic to Penicillin (as reported, pending clarification). He had tingling and shingles after the shot. He was very cold and sweaty and &#34;creepy&#34; (as reported not further clarified). The reporter called the nurse and they took over to have his blood pressure and it was 107/70. The reporter also added that just 4 minutes after the shot he had headache and dizziness and numbness bottom of his left foot and his toe, tingling under his foot and numbness under his toe. The patient did not take any treatment for the events but might take Tylenol for the headache. The outcome of the events his whole left side of his body went numb/still has the numbness down in his foot, his toe and on his left side, shingles, blood pressure turned dropping 107/70, headache and dizziness was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

Former smoker, quit 12&#43; yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, &#34;Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely.&#34; 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus &#43; drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, &#34;Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn&#39;t improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. &#34; 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: &#34;This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC&gt;4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient&#39;s presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient&#39;s chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving.&#34; 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued. Time of death: Jan 10,2021@14:56; immediate cause of death per death note is &#34;hypoxic respiratory failure&#34;

A 74-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Jan2021 at first single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included: the patient had pre-existing conditions, he was hospitalized in Dec2020 and he was undergoing a lot of testing and there was possibility that he had a form of cancer and they discovered something on the next to his lungs. The reporter stated they did not have all of the diagnosis of it yet and he was waiting to be seen for specialist. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 20Jan2021, the patient had a swelling. Swelling in the groin area above the hip. Skin is swollen and there is a lump. The reporter was trying to find out with the list of side effects if the lymph glands can swell and what areas of the body would you may be see swelling in the lymph nodes. The reporter wonder if there be lymph gland located for the men or the lymph gland located on the either side of the reproductive organ, in that area. What had happened to the patient, they were not sure if that was a side effect. One of the side effects the reporter knew it was listed on the website was lymph glands swell up. So the reporter just trying to find out if there were lymph glands in that same area where the patient was experience swelling right now. He did not have this issue before he got the vaccine, so it just sort of seemed this is. The reporter talked to the physician&#39;s office briefly when this happened just to see did they need to bring the patient in immediately for an appointment to check if it&#39;s (incomplete sentence). So far the patient just received topical ice packs over the area for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                DEATH Narrative:  Patient passed away after Covid Vaccine. 2/8/21: brought to the ER for evaluation for leg weakness and a recent fall associated. He was in a facility- per patient he fell when standing from the bed, he though he could do it and did not ask for help. He has been with hip and pelvic pain since then. The CT/XR shows evidence of lytic lesions, an IR bone biopsy was done and came positive for metastatic bladder carcinoma. 02/17/21: transferred to the facility for PT and pain management, originally for short stay rehab then changed to hospice care. 02/19/2021: received covid vaccine 03/05/21: discharged from facility on home hospice 03/23/21: pt passed away at home Patient with prior covid infection; tested positive last on 9/25/2020. Vaccine did not likely contribute to patient&#39;s death, as he was on hospice due to malignant cancer. No evidence of reaction immediately after vaccination or before date of death.

                                                Apparent lymphadenopathy on top of left shouder measuring ultimately roughly 10 c long, 4 c wide and 2 c high. It may have extended down to just above the clavicle next to the neck (4c away), where it receded over 36 hours from onsetat 8 pmJan 29.  Continuing as of this report as soft circular swelling about 5c diameter, 2 c high and sitting just above the clavicle. Clinician recommended no treatment as no other symptoms presented and breathing/swallowing were unaffected. I am likely to recieve chemo from newly recurring (Dec 2020) NHL -a biopsy is pending Feb 8 with diagnosis likely by Feb 16. Treatment TBD.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 11:10 AM  (at the age of 75 years), as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included kidney transplant. Concomitant medication included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MYCOPHENOLATE), prednisone. Historical vaccine included Dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL8982), on 14Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization). On 05Feb2021 at around 18:00 PM, the patient had what he believed was an anaphylactic reaction with tightness around his jaw area, ears, and throat, and tightness in upper chest (he clarified that upper chest as where the neck meets the chest. It may have been a little lower, but not that far down that he would have worried. It was the upper chest where the neck meets the chest. Not in the chest to the left or right). It lasted intermittently for 4 days. He reported that it was not continuous, it would come for 2-3 hours dissipate and then come again. It wasn&#39;t all day and all night. He reported &#34;I&#39;m better now&#34;. The clinical outcome of anaphylactic reaction with tightness around his jaw area, ears, and throat, and tightness in upper chest  was recovered on 10Feb2021.
