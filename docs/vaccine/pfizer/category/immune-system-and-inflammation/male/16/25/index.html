                                                MYOCARDITIS.  Patient is a 16 year old boy with ADHD who presented with fever and myalgias for 3 days, that progressed to sharp parasternal chest pain and some SOB. Patient received second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 4/26, and after that shot experienced fever to 102 at home and myalgias. Subsequently his symptoms of chest pain have occurred. He underwent workup revealing of elevated Troponin, and EKG with some ST segment elevation, a slightly elevated CRP at 32, and a normal ECHO. Admitted for observation and concern for infectious myocarditis vs MIS-C. Cardiac MRI was done confirming Myocarditis, Troponin I was elevated and peaked at 23, 325pg/mL. Workup unrevealing of SARS. Other testing showed Resp virus panel negative, blood pcr for EBV, CMV, Parvovirus B19, enterovirus, and adenovirus all negative, HIV antigen/antibody testing negative. Patient treated with Ketorolac with steady improvement in symptoms over several hospital days. Discharged home 5/2 with Troponin I well down and symptoms resolved. Given reports in lay press regarding other cases of COVID-19 MRNA vaccine associated myocarditis, we are reporting this as a vaccine associated adverse event.

He was in his usual state of good health until 2 days ago when he experienced fever, chills and myalgias after receiving his 2nd dose of COVID pfizer vaccine. He improved until 5/2 when he developed a crushing, non-radiating, substernal chest pain which was waxing and waning in nature without specific alleviating factors. He had shortness of breath, but no palpitation, dizziness, or changes in pain on exertion vs rest. Family activated EMS who gave 325 mg of aspirin en route to the ED.   In the ED, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was mildly diaphoretic, but otherwise, unremarkable on physical exam. STAT EKG showed ST elevations in V5 and V6 and ST depressions in V1 and V2 as well as PR depressions, which persisted on repeated EKG. Given concern for myopericarditis, they ordered labs including CBC, CMP, troponin and inflammatory markers which were only remarkable for troponin of 1.94 and CRP 3.5. Chest x-ray was normal.    Cardiology was consulted and they recommended transthoracic echo which is pending. Cards also recommended starting Ibuprofen 600 mg q8 hrs and admission to cards for further management.

Still has difficulty focusing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father). A 16-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: ER2613 and expiry: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 31Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Vaccination was taken because he was going back to school. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EN6199, Expiry: Jun2021) on 10Mar2021 at 13:30 in right arm (at the age of 16-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and experienced loss of taste and smell and joint pain, all events started in Mar2021. Medical history included mild allergy to Birch pollen (which everybody has, but nothing else/patient tested for allergies, and had no significant allergies, they thought he might be because he spilled a sugared soda behind his bookcase in his room and there was mold growing so they thought he might be allergic to mold, so they tested for allergies and he has no allergy to mold) and ongoing vitamin supplementation. Family Medical History included Sarcoidosis with mother. Concomitant medications included vitamin d3 for vitamin supplementation from 2020 (about a year ago) and ongoing; ascorbic acid, rosa canina fruit (VITAMIN C) for vitamin supplementation from an unspecified date (several years ago) and ongoing and an unspecified ongoing multivitamin from an unspecified date (several years ago) at 1 taken daily for vitamin supplementation. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm at 17:30, tiredness at 20:30, shortness of breath, headache at 22:30 and muscle pain at 22:30. On 01Apr2021, the patient experienced fever at 00:30, chills at 01:30, redness at 02:30, leg pain at 08:30, fatigue (ongoing) at 02:30, joint pain at 08:30, too sick to get out of bed and passed out and hit the floor, put a big bump on his head at 05:30 (about 15 hours after second dose, patient was at the kitchen table with his head between his knees trying to breathe, passed out, hit the floor and put a big bump on his head). On 02Apr2021, the patient experienced brain fog at 14:30, swelling at 14:30, swollen glands at 02:30, loss of taste and smell to some extent at 14:30 and too sick to get out of bed. On day 2 (02Apr2021) and was still about pushing 100 degrees Fahrenheit and on 21Apr2021 (after 21 days) sometimes over sometimes less. On the following Monday (05Apr2021), he struggled back to school after 5 days, but came home early. He has just been trashed, too trashed to train for his sport, further described as too weak to train, he hadn&#39;t trained for 3 weeks. He still has a fever. His local doctor did not have any suggestions other than he should take acetaminophen and ibuprofen alternately to get rid of the headache and fever. In 2021, the patient experienced 2-inch diameter raised circle at injection site and disappeared after 10 days and there was a time he could not barely remember his name, tried to study but just wasn&#39;t there, head on desk. Still has difficulty focusing and doing his calculus. It was reported that the time to recover from any exertion seems to be longer by a lot. On 01Apr2021, body temperature reached 103 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient tried to do a few things like a week ago just because he couldn&#39;t stand to be in the house anymore he took a bike out for about 15 minutes and was just trashed from that experience and took 3 days to recover. The events did not require emergency room visit nor physician&#39;s office neither hospitalized. The outcome was recovered from loss of consciousness, head injury on 01Apr2021; from illness on 02Apr2021; from headache on 04Apr2021; from chills on 06Apr2021; from pain in arm and fatigue on 07Apr2021; from erythema on 11Apr2021; from ageusia and anosmia on 14Apr2021; from lymphadenopathy on 16Apr2021; from arthralgia on 17Apr2021; from myalgia on 18Apr2021; from leg pain on 21Apr2021; from vaccination site swelling in 2021; then recovered with sequel from dyspnoea on 05Apr2021 and from swelling on 07Apr2021; then recovering from pyrexia, feeling abnormal; then not recovered from asthenia and unknown for the remaining events.

On Thursday 4/29/2021, he developed &#34;heartburn&#34;, and on Friday 4/30/2021 he developed chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. He presented to Hospital on  late 4/30/2021 or early 5/1/2021 for evaluation; initial labs showed a CRP of 1.23, POC troponin of 6.56 ng/mL (03:18 on 5/1) and lab level of 17.6 ng/mL  (03:05 on 5/1) that increased to 24 ng/mL later in the morning on 5/1. COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was transferred to another Hospital mid-day on 5/1/2021 due to concerns for myocarditis/myopericarditis. He was started on NSAIDs. His troponin level improved, had decreased to 9.69 ng/mL on 5/2/2021; at that point as his chest pain had improved and labs were improving, parents requested that he be discharged from the hospital. He had 2 echocardiograms at PCH which reportedly showed normal biventricular systolic function. He had an echo at the hospital on 5/2/2021 which showed normal biventricular systolic function, no pericardial effusion, and normal valves.   As an outpatient, he had repeat troponin-I levels: 2.49 ng/mL on 5/3; 0.31 ng/mL on 5/5; the troponin level was reportedly normal on 5/10/2021 per his primary cardiologist

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable reporter reporting for her son, via Pfizer sponsored program.  A 16-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose at the age of 16-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.   The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  After 24 hours from vaccination, on 25Apr2021, he felt pain on the injection site. For that, the mother gave her son Tylenol to treat the symptoms. Then after 24 hours, on 26Apr2021 he felt fine. However, 2 days after, on 28Apr2021, he felt pain underneath the left side of his armpit, had a fever with a temperature of 102.8 F, and the right side of his neck was swollen. In addition to this, he was experiencing a lot of body aches, headache, and pain on his neck. They already contacted their HCP and prescribed him with antibiotics in Apr2021. He was tired and almost lethargic in Apr2021. Reporter wanted to know if her son should still receive the 2nd dose. The reporter was invited to consult her HCP. The outcome of pain on the injection site was recovering, of all other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events Neck swelling, Armpit pain, and Fever cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 16-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 29Apr2021 15:30 at the age of 16 years old (Lot Number: E000167) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history, no known allergies. Concomitant medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination included vitamins nos (MULTIVITAMIN [VITAMINS NOS]), acetaminophen. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EN6208) intramuscular in Arm left on 07Apr2021 13:00 at the age of 16 years old for covid-19 immunisation. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was Other. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.

                                                Patient is a 16yo girl admitted on 5/19 with sepsis secondary to myocarditis and pneumonia, s/p IVIG, after presenting with fever, myalgia, sore throat, hypotension, elevated troponin, elevated CRP, and leukocytosis with left shift. Sore throat has been present for about a week and fevers began on 5/17 with a Tmax of 103. On 5/18, she began developing shortness of breath and upon evaluation by the PCP on 5/19, she was admitted. During initial workup on 5/19 upon admission, hospitalist was high concerned as she developed hypotension of 91/48 on 5/20 at 08:35am. CT of chest on 5/20 showed patchy consolidation of the posterior lower lobes bilaterally. At that point, I was contacted and recommended broadening regimen to clindamycin , ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Upon transfer to Hospital, further serologies were collected which showed leukocytosis with left shift, highly elevated CRP, elevated troponin, elevated IL-6, elevated ferritin, negative Covid abs test, negative RVP, and negative Covid PCR. IVIG (2grams/kg) started on 5/20 at 22:57. Cardio and ID on board and all regular myocarditis infectious workup has been collected. ID consulted for workup and management.     Of note, patient received the Covid vaccine on 5/1/21

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old male presenting to hospital as a transfer for chest pain and elevated Troponin levels concerning for myocarditis. Patient has otherwise been healthy. Two days ago he received his second dose of COVID vaccination. He initially felt fine, but later that day had some body aches. The next day he felt feverish off and on and had dull left upper sternal border chest pain intermittently. Today, he reports sharp 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, lightheadedness, sweating, chills, and intermittent non-productive cough. He presented to original hospital for evaluation. The patient admits to tactile warmth since Sunday with no documented temperatures. He recently received his second dose of Pfizer just before onset of these symptoms. He reports difficulty sleeping since Sunday, but no shortness of breath, rashes, syncope, nausea, or vomiting. He has not had any other recent illness, fevers, or known COVID-19 exposures. He denies any history of prior cardiac disease and there is no known family history of cardiac disease, arrhythmias, or sudden death in the child or adolescent period. He denies illicit or recreational drug use. In the ED, he was well appearing with pain now 1 out of 10. POC troponin was 16.8 ng/mL. He had labs pertinent for ESR 10, CRP 3.0, BNP 24. RP2 PCR was negative. UDS was negative except for opiates (s/p morphine). IV was placed and patient was started on IV fluids. EKG was obtained and showed questionable left atrial enlargement per ED read. Cardiology was consulted and performed Echocardiogram in the ED at bedside and was within normal limits. Cardiology resident team contacted for admission. Past Medical History: No major medical diagnoses Past Surgical History: Orchiopexy, T&amp;A Family History: No cardiac family history Social History: Lives at home with mother. Has two healthy siblings not living at home Immunizations: Up to date Medications: None Allergies: NKDA Etiology of likely myocarditis remains unclear at this time. In his age group, this would most likely represent a viral myocarditis. He would likely benefit from cardiac MRI during this admission for further evaluation of myocarditis. His EKG findings with his age group are unlikely to be secondary to myocardial infarct. No arrhythmias or heart block noted on EKG at time of admission or telemetry in ED. There is no family history of autoimmune disease or cardiac disease to suggest an autoimmune component or genetic etiology.

                                                The day after the vaccination started hives.  But it was slow so thought could be food allergic reaction. Over a period of 2 weeks it developed never went off.  Noticing the hives   getting worse and the epsode starting day after vaccination suspected it the cause and so went to primary care physician.  She diagnosed the hives related to medical side effects and only medical related item he had within the last 1 year was this vaccine.  She put him on Methylprednisolone for 6 days along with Cetirizine HCL 10mg.  The hives appeared to be suppressed for the first 3 days where the dose was higher, however, when the dosage was getting lower after day 3 it came back with high intensity.  Lips, fingers, tongue...swollen and with fever running at upto 101.6.  Again went to the doctor, she put him on Prednisone with 40 mg for 3 days, 20 mg for 3 days, 10mg for 3 days and 10mg alternate days.  It literally took more than 1 and half month still not recovered.  Hives are still on and also severe cold with mucus and cough started since (05/09/21).  Fever show up on and off even now.  We&#39;re referred to allergy specialists.  She asked to not take 2nd dose.  Increased dosage of Antihistamines, asked to continue Prednisone 10mg for 6 more day daily 10mg and if cold and cough does go in the next 2 days may put on antibiotics.

                                                17-year old M with history of recurrent ear infections requiring PE tube placement who was in his usual state of health until 5/5 when he noticed a new itchy hive-like rash. He was short of breath 5/6, and developed fevers that night along with vomiting. He was seen 5/6 with negative COVID19 PCR and documented fever to 104. Fevers continued, and he was admitted the evening of 5/10 with concern for myocarditis. See below for hospital course. Additional information for Item 18: ...Screening labs were notable for mild lymphopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis, and elevated inflammatory markers.  Given prior COVID infection, rash, and systemic inflammation, additional studies including troponin, D-dimer, BNP, and EKG were obtained.  EKG was reassuringly normal, however the D-dimer (2.48), troponin (1.27), and BNP (469) were elevated.  Other work-up included chest x-ray which was unremarkable, and right upper quadrant ultrasound with incidental cavernous hemangioma of the liver.  He was started on milrinone (5/11-5/12) after initial TTE was concerning for severely diminished LV function. Follow-up TTE 12 hours later was normal (on milrinone), and remained so after milrinone was discontinued 5/12. Follow-up TTE after discontinuation remained normal. Cardiac MRI was completed 5/14, although read remains pending. He received IVIG on 5/11, and was started on methylpred 50 mg IV BID, Anakinra 100 mg SQ BID 5/14,  and transitioned to prednisone 30 mg PO BID with clinical improvement, down-trending troponin and systemic inflammatory labs.  Subsequent CBCs have been notable for rising leukocytosis (5/16 WBC 56.3) and thrombocytosis (5/16 plts 690) and 4&#43; spherocytes (with no known personal or prior history of spherocytosis). He will likely be discharged 5/17.   Infectious evaluation was unrevealing including cultures and viral studies. COVID spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were sent, but remain pending. Pt. initial COVID-19 infection was diagnosed October 2020, with positive saliva PCR testing.  He was symptomatic for 3-5 days.  He received his second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine 4/27 in his left arm; denies any significant reactions (arm swelling, injection site redness, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, fatigue, or fever). He has had passing contact with school classmates who have recently been diagnosed with COVID19.

                                                Patient is a 17 yo male with no hx asthma who presented to medical center ED as transfer from facility with pleuritic chest pain and fever x1 day. Recent history of second covid vaccine on Friday (5/14). Patient reported associated fatigue, headache and muscle aches late Friday into Saturday (5/15). Sunday patient reported a fever (101 F) and chest pain with deep inspiration. No associated SOB, increased work of breathing or abdominal pain. Was seen initially at urgent care and then referred to facility for &#34;an abnormal EKG.&#34;    Pertinent findings at facility: troponin 0.31, EKG wnl, rapid covid negative, ESR 9, CK 134, D-dimer &lt;150, WBC 12.4 w/ left shift. Transferred to medical center for further workup.   While in medical center ED, troponin 1.59. EKG rSR&#39; leads V1-V3 w/o ST segment elevation. MISC tier 1 studies drawn. Cardiology consulted - admit for observation, myocarditis infectious workup, echocardiogram and  During his time in the ED, patient continued to have pain with deep inspiration as well as when he had to yawn. He other wise felt fine. Vital signs normal throughout out time in ED.  His troponin continued to rise, with max of 14, so decision was made to start IVIG and steroids. His troponin fell over the next day. He remained stable from a clinical standpoint, and symptoms had resolved by the morning of 5/18. At time of filing, patient is still hospitalized at medical center, with further labs and imaging pending.

Pt states he has had 1 day of sudden onset L shoulder pain and chest pain. Endorses dyspnea due to pain with deep breaths, denies tachypnea, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis. Endorses mild chills and aches after COVID vaccine 3 days prior to onset of symptoms, denies any fever, URI symptoms, diarrhea, rash, known COVID contacts. Pain continued to worsen and spread across his chest, causing presentation to ED this afternoon. No history of PE, DVT, long travel, recent surgery, malignancy, alcohol or cocaine use. Significant cardiac history in family: dad with CAD w/LAD blockage, both parents with hypertension.    At ED, labs notable for elevated troponin 0.456, repeat 0.67 and diffuse ST elevations on EKG concerning for pericarditis. COVID neg, CXR unremarkable, blood cx drawn, no abx started. Patient was given toradol for pain with minimal improvement. Peds cardiology was consulted and patient was transferred to different ED for further care.   At different ED, repeat EKG showed similar diffuse ST elevations in I, II, aVL. Repeat troponins uptrending (4.91), proBNP 562, ESR 43, CRP 18. Mildly tachycardic but otherwise hemodynamically stable. Given tylenol for pain. Cardiology recommended admission for trending troponins, echo and cardiac monitoring.  CV: Troponins were trended every 12 hours with a max of 4.91.  His last troponin checked on the morning of discharge was 0.41.  He had an echo that showed normal cardiac function, an MRI that indicated normal ventricular size and function, with minimal or healing and inflammation or mild myocarditis.  During his admission, he had continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, that did not show any arrhythmias.   Resp: On 2L NC for comfort, no respiratory distress or hypoxia.   FENGI: Regular diet   Neuro: Ibuprofen scheduled and tylenol PRN for pain.  He was initially started on ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, but was starting to have pain prior to being due for medicine every 8 hours so his regimen was changed to 600 mg every 6 hours which controlled his pain adequately.   ID: Myocarditis panel sent with some results still pending.  Thus far, he is CMV negative, EBV IgG was positive but not IgM.  RVP was negative.  This all occurred in the setting receiving the Covid vaccine 3 days prior to presentation, which has been reported as a rare reaction to the Covid vaccine.  At the time of discharge, labs pending results include mycoplasma pneumonia, coxsackie, parvovirus, enterovirus. Etiology of myocarditis remains unclear at this time, could be related to infectious etiology not yet clear to us, vs related to his COVID vaccine prior to admission.

The patient received his 2nd COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine on Thursday, 05/20/2021 in his left arm.  The patient developed a temperature of a 102.5° with aches, chill, and pain overnight.  The symptoms subsequently dissipated.  Around noon on 5/22 he began to experience an achiness and pressure beneath the sternum and it has been constant since.  The pain does not radiate into the back.  No associated ripping or tearing sensation.  No shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. In ED, EKG showed normal intervals, no ST changes and no STEMI. The patient underwent a CT angio of the chest and abdomen and did not show any dissection of the aorta.   The left and right proximal coronaries are visible, however their path could not be seen on the studies performed.  No pneumomediastinum both pneumothorax was observed. He had an elevated troponin of 3.1 and it increased to 7.3 prior to transfer to the ICU.  VS were stable with HR 80 - 90 and normal BP. Repeat ECG was normal but his troponin increased x 2 with maximum of 16. His CRP was mildly elevated and BPN upper limits of normal. Echo was normal.  Cardiologist consulted and pt diagnosed with myocarditis.  As of 5/24/21, patient remains hospitalized as troponin was 13.1 at 9:00 am.

                                                Patient received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 5/7/21. On 5/13/21 he began to feel feverish (unsure Tmax, never took temperature) and was intermittently febrile until hospital admission on 5/20/21. On 5/18/21 he was seen in the ED for fever and tested positive for strep throat and started on amoxicillin. His inflammatory labs were elevated at this time and did not notice improvement on amoxicillin. He returned to the ED on 5/20/21 at which time patient reported headaches on the right side, sharp 7/10 pain which come and go with the fevers as well as fatigue, muscle/body aches, and sweats in addition to persistent fever. He also noticed maculopapular rash on palms and soles and on distal extremities which was not pruritic or painful on day of hospital admission. All infectious workup was negative and patient did not improve on broad spectrum antibiotics. Given his persistent fever, hypotension, and inflammatory labs without other cause, patient was empirically treated for MIS-C and was given IVIG and methylprednisolone as well as being started on prophylactic dose enoxaparin for his elevated D-dimer. Repeat echocardiogram identified a new coronary aneurysm, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. Following IVIG and steroids patient remained afebrile and inflammatory markers down trended, however liver enzymes remained elevated at time of discharge. He improved and was discharged to finish steroid course at home with close follow up.

He had fever and headache for about 24-36 hours, which he had also had after the first dose of the vaccine. On 5/23, he woke up with constant substernal chest pain, which worsened with exertion and deep inspiration. The pain increased throughout the day. In the ED, he was found to have elevated troponin ,CK-MB,  elevated CPK, and elevated liver enzymes. EKG was concerning for ST elevation initially.  Bedside echocardiogram showed low-normal function, normal coronaries, trace effusion, and no evidence of RV strain. Troponin and NT pro BNP were increased upon admission to our facility. Repeat ECHO showed borderline global hypokinesis of the LV with an LVEF of 51%. He received IVIG on 5/24/21 and also was started on ketorolac on 5/24/21. Troponin and CK were trending downwards at the time of this submission.

She states the hives were huge in size also that he also had diarrhea 24 hours after his vaccine. He was taken to the ER to get checked out. At the ER they told her that maybe a bee sting him or it was because of the vaccine. His right hand and forearm were swollen.  The hives lasted a few hours then it went away. He was given Benadryl for 5 days straight at the ER which helped to decrease his symptoms.  His mother states he is no longer having the hives or diarrhea.

Initial symptoms presented with rhinorrhea, then severee headache, neck pain, and fever (tactile). Had sweats and chills. Began to experience diarrhea, dysuria, diffue body aches and myalgias. Severe pain in his neck / posterior occiput. Denied any mental status changes at the time.   Studies largely negative for an identifiable bacterial process so presumptive diagnosis is aseptic meningitis. Unclear if from vaccine or other etiologies. Outside hospital had started antibiotics but this was stopped and patient symptomatically recovered with only symptomatic care.

The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 03Apr2021 (next day after first dose), when woke up, patient experienced swollen lymph node under the left armpit (the same arm he got vaccine), and lymph node used to hurt a lot but now it was just really big. It was still there a month later when he was getting his second dose. The patient mother stated that they wanted to see the doctor to see how bad her son symptoms were and because of pain but the doctor told them to call Pfizer and stated that family doctor does not want to see them because there is nothing that they can do. The events not required any visit to emergency room or physician office. No relevant tests were done. There was no investigation assessment. Reporter stated that he was wondering if this is still normal to be there. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The outcome of the event swollen lymph node under the left armpit was not resolved, while outcome of the event lymph node used to hurt a lot but now it was just really big was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                On Monday, May 31, 2021 at 1:20am pt. woke up with intense chest pain and labored breathing.  He was able to fall back to sleep and woke up two hours later (3am) with the pain escalating.  He did fall back to sleep again and once again woke up at 9am only to learn the pain was even worse and was barely able to breathe.  He called me, his mother, and I raced him home and straight to our local Emergency Room.  The ER originally thought it was a collapsed lung.  After the x-ray came back negative for a pneumothorax, they continued testing.  The very last test they did showed extremely elevated Troponin numbers at 1.05 and C-reactive Protein (CRP) numbers at 5.42.  We were transferred by EMS/ambulance to the hospital 40 minutes away and checked into the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Pt was admitted in the afternoon of May 31st and was released on June 3rd at 1:30pm.  June 1st his Troponin was 0.26 and CRP was 6.10.  June 2nd Troponin was .45 and CRP was 3.54.  The day he was released from the PICU (June 3rd ), his Troponin was .45, and the CRP was down to  1.83.  Pt received daily EKGs, 24-hour heart monitoring, constant blood pressure tests, as well as blood oxygen levels.  Once released from the hospital, Pt will be on light duty for at least a week, if not more.  First follow-up Cardiologist appointment was June 8th at 10:30am.  Echocardiogram, EKG, and blood work was ?normal.? Pt was put on a 72 hour heart monitor on June 8th and will be removed June 11th.  Will start weaning off Ibuprofen and acid reducer, Pantoprazole, the next three weeks.  Will continue to take Colchicine for three months, as well as light movement and exercise, nothing strenuous (swimming, running, etc.).  Follow-up with cardiologist in one month (beginning of July).

                                                PT was in observation period and came up to the consultation window asking if a numb arm was a normal side effect of the vaccines. At further inspection I noticed that he was having a rash . I had a sit for a few more minutes then his mom came up and we noticed that his arm started to swell. We gave him 2 capsules Benadryl 25mg and instructed him to go to urgent care. Called for a follow up later in the evening and found that urgent care send him to the ER. The rash was spread all over and well as the swelling. He swelled all the way to his toes. He also tuned white and became very lightheaded at the ER. They gave him IV Benadryl and dexamethasone and was sent home. It has been recommended by the ER doctors to not get the 2nd dose.

                                                The adverse event started with discomfort in the arm, body aches, then progressed to headaches, more severe body aches, and chills.  Later in the day of 3/12/21, Patient began to spike a fever which eventually went to 102. He continually suffered from headaches, fatigue, body aches, and chills.  We attempted to control the symptoms with Tylenol. All symptoms continued on Saturday.  There was some minor control with Tylenol.  At approximately 9:30 am  patient had discomfort in his left underarm, when he lifted his arm, he became aware of a tennis ball size lump under his arm. Patient was suffering from severe lymphadenopathy in his left underarm and down the left side of his neck, with less severe but significant lymphadenopathy in the right underarm and down the right side of his neck.  Patient&#39;s fever continued to hover around 101 to 102 Saturday and Sunday. There were times, within an hour of taking Tylenol that it might drop to 99, but would go right back up.  He continued to experience fatigue, chills, etc... His fever finally broke on Monday morning and he is still experiencing some lymphadenopathy, but the lymph nodes are starting to reduce s of 3/17/21.

                                                Patient presented to the emergency department early March 28, 2021 after experiencing 5-7 hours of chest pain. The chest started when the patient went to bed the evening of March 27, where he began having substernal non-radiating chest pain with inspiration. The pain was relieved by sitting upright and by taking some acetaminophen. He received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on March 25 (first dose was March 5). He was initially treated with ketorolac 15mg IV and given 1 liter of lactated ringer&#39;s solution via IV.  His chest pain resolved after this. He was eventually given colchicine 0.6mg twice daily and ibuprofen 600mg 3 times daily due to concern for myopericarditis. He was ultimately found to have no evidence of pericarditis after undergoing a cardiac MRI, thus colchicine and ibuprofen were discontinued. Due to findings of mildly reduced ejection fraction on imaging, he was started on metoprolol XL 25mg once daily at discharge.

                                                My son received his first vaccine dose in his left arm on Friday April 9 at 8:45 am.  By Sunday when he woke up, he noticed a walnut sized lump on his left clavicle.  It felt unusual and moved on the bone every time he turned his head or moved his arm. There was no redness or fever and it felt hard.  It was still there on Monday morning (April 12) so we called his primary care doctor which is where he received the vaccine.  The doctor felt it could be a cyst or swollen lymph node and is sending him to a general surgeon next week for further evaluation. The doctor was uncertain if the lump was directly related to the vaccination. Other than acne, patient has no other preexisting conditions.  He did have COVID19 in November with only mild symptoms (positive test on 11-23-20; no fever or cough, just felt tired for a couple days).

He initially had chest pain the day prior to admission with pain in his back and down his left arm. This improved with Tylenol and resolved prior to bed. On the morning of 5/6 the chest pain returned and was so severe it woke him from sleep. He was difficult for him to characterize, but he said it was all over his chest, sometimes sharp and pressure-like, most severe in mid substernal region and was so substantial that he had difficulty speaking properly. He feels that the pain is most severe when lying flat and is best managed when he is resting at a 45 degree angle. Patient was at ED he was found to have an initial ECG with ST depressions in aVR and elevations in II, aVF, and V2 through V6 raising suspicion for pericarditis/myocarditis. Initial troponin was elevated at 4.35 as well. Cardiology Dr. was contacted by ED physician, case discussed, and EKGs reviewed and felt this was more likely pericarditis, but not STEMI. Of note, he reports a family history significant for his mother having a?hole in her heart.?He was given Toradol with improvement in his pain and upon arrival to hospital his chest pain was markedly improved.  He was noted to have troponins peaking at 39.415 that down trended and an elevated CRP of 4.8 on admission. D-dimer was 0.26. Covid PCR was negative.  He was evaluated by cardiology again here who upon review of his ECG and cardiac enzymes as well as presentation was consistent with pericarditis. Echocardiogram showed normal LV systolic function with trace posterior pericardial effusion and telemetry was monitored without any arrhythmias. He was started on low-dose beta-blockers, aspirin 650 mg 3 times a day, and colchicine 0.6 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses followed by 0.6 mg daily. He is planned to continue this for approximately 3 months and will need to follow-up with cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks for repeat monitoring and management with plan to taper off aspirin once his CRP normalizes.  Later that night, he even had a similar episode of sudden onset chest pain for which she received IV Toradol with minimal relief and oral Tylenol with relief of symptoms after that. No telemetry abnormalities were recorded at that time.   ECG the following day showed improving ST changes and troponin of 26.328 with CRP 4.2. He had no further symptoms for over 24 hours and is responding well to treatment.   He is advised to take Tylenol as needed in addition to the above-mentioned medicines should he have any recurrent chest pain.

He was admitted to the hospital on May 11th 2021 for a vaso-occlusive pain crisis. He then developed fevers, increased inflammatory markers, coagulopathy and significant tachycardia- echocardiogram, was done which showed coronary artery aneurysms raising concern for Mis-C. Retrospectively, his previous echocardiogram few years ago also showed coronary dilation although now it was slightly worse.  patient was given IVIG and steroids as treatment for Mis-C following which fevers resolved and his inflammatory markers improved. He is being followed with serial echocardiograms which shows stable echo findings.  He remains in the hospital still for treatment of his pain crisis.

I was extremely tired I could not go to work.  I did not eat all day but I did take a lukewarm shower and some Tylenol.. About 5 PM my fever broke and it still took another 24 hours for me to feel myself again.

                                                Per patient he received his second Covid vaccine 3 days prior to arrival and immediately following developed myalgias, subjective fevers and &#34; viral symptoms&#34; which she managed with ibuprofen 2 tabs q6h some improvement.  On the day prior to arrival he developed increasing shortness of breath particularly with talking and with ambulation.  He also describes chest tightness with deep inspiration, the tightness radiates to back, no radiation to left arm or jaw.  Chest tightness is non-positional, but does feel worse immediately after he lies down from ambulation and then slowly dissipates.  His last subjective fever was yesterday evening.  He has never had a reaction to the vaccine before.  He has no allergies.  No prior medical conditions he is aware of, and takes no medications.  He did not experience any of the symptoms following the first vaccine. He has h/o asymptomatic COVID infection in November 2020. Cardiology consulted for concern of pericarditis post COVID-19 vaccine. He does not have significant ST elevation or PR depression.  He also does not have evidence of significant pericardial effusion at this point.  The high sensitivity troponins are mildly elevated.  He does have viral syndrome.  Is unclear if Covid vaccination was causally related to his symptoms.  We would like to improve his medications for better chest pain control and to prevent recurrent pericarditis in the future.

The pain returned about 6 hours later and was getting more severe so he went to see his doctor. There an EKG was abnormal so he was referred to the ED where a work up showed ST elevations c/w pericarditis and an elevated trop I of 24.   The night prior, he reported a low grade temperature. He has not had any more fevers for the past 12-18 hours. He denies any other symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, cough syncope. He denies sick contacts but did have a sore throat 4-5 days ago without any other associated symptoms. He has had recent negative COVID tests while at college.

Placed on telemetry monitoring for the duration of the admission. Started on IV steroids and given IVIG on hospital day 1. Continued on toradol which was switched to motrin on hospital day 2. Cardiac MRI did not show signs of fibrosis. Troponin downtrended throughout his stay. At the time of DC echo showed normal function, ekg showed T wave inverions, and troponin was down trending to 0.57. Pt to be restricted from physical activity until cleared by cardiology. Infectious workup also sent, most of which was pending at time of discharge.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The vaccine was administered to the writer at 0800 on 1/5/2021. No immediate reactions were noticed for the 30 minutes observation period immediately after. The writer&#39;s muscle that received the vaccine began to become increasingly sore throughout the day; however, that was similar to the first dose of the same vaccine a few weeks prior. The pain was described as constant (2/10) but aggravated with motion. The pain did interfere with the writer&#39;s normal range of motion (specifically raising the writer&#39;s arm above shoulder height). From 0800-2200 on 1/5/2021 no noticeable symptoms except for the injection site pain occurred.   At 2200, the writer rapidly developed chills, body aches, a headache, fatigue, and a fever of 100.8. These symptoms were left untreated and continued through the night (the symptoms did not interfere with sleep). The writer woke up at 1300 on 1/6/2021; all previous symptoms had resolved by this time except for the injection site pain. By 1400 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed pain near the right axillary lymph nodes. The pain can be described as moderate (1/10) and generally occurred only with motion. The writer was unable to palpate any swelling in the area. Around 1800 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed it felt weird to swallow. Specifically, it felt as if there was a slight internal swelling 1-inch subhyoidally and 1-2 inches laterally within the right side of his neck when he swallowed. The swelling was not palpable from the skin&#39;s surface. The writer did not seek medical attention as breathing/eating/drinking were not made more difficult but monitored this closely. The swelling in the neck resolved by 2000 on 1/6/2021. The lymph node pain in the right arm resolved over the course of a few days and was no longer present by 1/9/2021 at 1300.

                                                I felt muscle aches and pains  about 6-8 hours after I received the vaccine. I had COVID-19 in late January 2021, and these symptoms from the vaccine felt about the same as the COVID symptoms I had, they just didn&#39;t last as long. However, around 36 hours after I received my vaccine, my armpit area started to become sore. It has felt swollen and sore for the past 36-48 hours. I also developed a fever of around 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit today, so around 72 hours after I received the vaccine. I have also been fatigued for the past 3 days.

                                                Initial presentation Patient was in his usual state of good health until 4/19 when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. He awoke the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. The next day he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the ED with a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure of 100/69mmHg, heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, patient was ill-appearing with diffuse pustules on his face, chest and back, periorbital edema, and leukoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa. His abdomen was soft and tender to palpation in the suprapubic area and at both costovertebral angles. Hospital course In the ED the patient was found to have a metabolic acidosis of pH 7.33 with an anion gap of 16, lactate 2.6, neutrophilic leukocytosis (22k), acute renal insufficiency with a BUN of 45 and creatinine 3.81 (baseline is 0.76). The patient?s urine demonstrated packed RBCs and 5-10 WBCs. He was admitted to the medicine service for further management. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have rhabdomyolysis (CK 584), worsening renal failure (Creatinine 8), follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. CT A/P without contrast showed increased attenuation of renal pelves and ureters consistent with hemorrhage, but no renal stones or hydronephrosis was seen. The patient was treated with pulse dose 500mg IV Methylprednisilone for 3 days and then transitioned to 60mg Prednisone. The patient?s pustular rash and oral leukoplakia greatly improved while on pulse dose steroids, but his kidney function continued to decline (Creatinine rising from 8 to 11), and the patient?s bilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. Bilateral hearing loss prompted an MRI of the brain which identified several punctate infarcts across multiple vascular territories in bilateral cortices and left cerebellum. The patient?s kidney function has continued to decline, with progressive hyperkalemia and hemodialysis was begun.

It continue to persists even today  and fluctuates in size and temperature throughout the day with the lymph node being largest in the morning.

This pit has been leaking fluid since 7:00 AM yesterday, on April 2. There is a mild, numbing pain in the region, and I&#39;ve taken Ibuprofin to deal with that pain.    I don&#39;t know how long this will last, but according to the handout I got, swollen lymph nodes are normal and I had no other adverse side effects other than feeling a bit drowsy this morning, though me staying up until 3:00 AM playing video games could be a confounding effect.

                                                On 4/22 I felt two lymph nodes behind my left clavicle. Today is 4/26 and the lymph nodes felt larger so I saw the NP at the Drs Office and she gave me an order for an ultrasound of my neck if my lymph nodes don&#39;t go down in 10 days or if they get larger. The order states it is due to the assessment finding lymphadenopathy of left cervical region.

Patient says that he was in his USOH until yesterday when he started having substernal chest pain which was getting worse with inspiration but also with specific movements. He does have pain even at rest sometimes but he thinks that it&#39;s exacerbating by breathing. Had some nausea/vomiting as well. Denies other symptoms. Not really sob or leg swelling.    In the ER, his Trop I was 10.7 and his WBC was 12.2. His EKG was NSR with short PR and STE I, II, III, AVF, V4-V6  Patient is a 21 y.o. male with no past medical history who got his second dose of COVID (Pfizer) vaccine on Saturday presented with chest pain since Sunday with some pleuritic characteristics. He was found to have a very elevated trop I to 10.7, leukocytosis to 12.2 and STE in I, II, III, AVF, V4-V6. His POCUS in the ER was without significant pericardial effusion and probably normal EF. Differential at this point includes pericarditis vs myopericarditis (there are some myocarditis cases reported in Israel post Pfizer vaccination, predominantly in young male patients) vs less likely ACS.

He apparently had the findings are vaccine 2 days ago and developed pleuritic chest pain.  His ECG shows pathognomonic changes for pericarditis in the is a small troponin elevation.  He has no past medical history or exertional symptoms to suggest CAD.  Bedside echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular systolic function.  He was admitted and placed on aspirin and colchicine.  A cardiac MRI today showed evidence of myopericarditis.  He had 3 beats of nonsustained VT on tele.

                                                Pericarditis diagnosis:  This is a 21 year old male who presented to the emergency department on 4/27/21 with a two-day history of chest pain.  He was seen in a  emergency department on 4/26 and reported a normal EKG, blood work, and x-ray.  He was discharged home.  His was worsened so he reported to an urgent care in .  That team had a concern for pericarditis, so referred the patient to the  emergency room.  He had a reproducible pain over the costal margin but did describe a positional component.  Provider felt they still had to consider pericarditis as well as costochondritis.  The suspicion for pulmonary embolism or acute coronary syndrome or very low.  The suspicion also for myocarditis was low.  His EKG did show some J-point elevation versus ST elevation in the anterior and lateral leads.  There was no evidence of reciprocal depression.  His troponin test was normal.  His CBC and metabolic panel were normal.  He had had CRP which was mildly elevated at 4.6. A bedside point-of-care ultrasound showed no evidence of a pericardial effusion.  Provider felt it was reasonable to treat him for pericarditis although his EKG is not classic for this.  It was recommended he use his scheduled ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times a day.  He was also given a 1 month course of daily colchicine 0.6 mg. It was recommend he follow closely with his PCP to see if he needs to have this colchicine course extended.  He will follow-up with his primary doctor in 1 week for repeat check.

He was noted to be tachycardic and hypotensive with a severe leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers and &#43; troponin, and an LVEF 35-40%. He was referred to tertiary care center, had a cardiac MRI that showed little inflammation but LVEF now 12%.  On 5/21/21 he was started on high dose steroids and placed on mechanical circulatory support with VA ECMO.  Cardiac function quickly improved and he is ready to come off VA ECMO 5/29 with an LVEF improved to &gt; 40% during weaning trials.

                                                I started feeling achy around 9:00 pm and felt like I was going to get more ill. I took some Tylenol in hopes it would help but it got worse throughout the night. During the night, I couldn?t hardly sleep due to feeling really hot and achy. I felt like I had a fever but did not have a thermometer to check it. When I woke up this morning, I noticed I had a knot on my clavicle which I believe it to be a swollen supraclavicular lymph node. I was unable to go to my internship today due to feeling ill but I am feeling better now after sleep and medication.

This was accompanied by a mass that developed under my right armpit, about 4-5 cm in diameter and bulging out to the point that I felt it touching my upper arm before I even saw it in a mirror. It was not red, and it was malleable with a small, hard nodule in the center. I used an ice compression and some ibuprofen over a few days, and it has receded about 95% of the way, almost back to normal.

A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EK9231, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm (top of shoulder) on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history, stated that he is perfeclty healthy.  There were no concomitant medications. There were no prior vaccination within 4 weeks.The patient received the first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine on 12Jan2021. It was administered in his left arm; however, he has developed a rash on his right arm and right leg. It&#39;s kind of large but it is not oozing or anything. The patient wanted to know if this is a normal side effect. He wanted to know if this a serious allergic reaction. He stated that he got the first dose Tuesday and he is beginning to have, he does not know if it is a mild allergic reaction or just a symptom but he has a rash on his right arm right around the elbow and one his leg it is like little red bumps that kind of itch. In his paperwork it is saying one symptoms that could be severe allergic reaction is a rash all over the body so he is wondering if this is a mild reaction of some sort and also if there are any other cases like this. He first noticed the rash on his arm yesterday (14Jan2021) after he took a shower he looked on his arm and seen a trail going down and today he noticed one on his leg. He noticed the area on his arm yesterday and today he noticed the area on his leg. He says they are little red bumps that itch. He does not know if it was kind of wet but there was a little trail going down and its itchy, it is only the 2 spots that he has noticed are really bad. He says is has persisted he thinks it has remained about the same, he definitely won&#39;t say they have gotten worse, they may have swelled up a little bit, he is trying not to scratch but he has scratched a little bit so that is probably why it has swollen up a little bit. The patient has not taken anything for the events; other than using lotion, he was putting lotion on when he first noticed it. The patient had not recovered from the events.

Did have some swelling and motor loss, NO CP, SOB or sensory loss, no redness, no injury, no fever, chills, ha, depression sore throat, cough, rash, lymphadenopathy, abd pain, GI distress, no trauma or recent illnesses. 2/21: admitted clinic w/rhabdomyolysis: no preceding workouts, increased activity on ship, back sleeper, no alcohol, no trauma,. nsp: skin intact, no erythema. Mild edema to upper arm around triceps. Mild purple discoloration to dorsum of hand. Palp: TTP about triceps. TTP anterior shoulder. TTP biceps. Able to palpate triceps tendon and biceps tendon. NTTP throughout the rest of hand and forearm. Hand is cooler relative to contralateral side. NTTP cervical spine. ROM: Full passive ROM of the shoulder and elbow with pain. No micromotion pain with any joint in the upper extremity. Painless cervical spine ROM. Motor: 3/5 strength to OP/FPL/2nd FDP, EIP/EPL, 1st and 2nd DIO. 3/5 deltoid, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors. Sens: Decreased sensation throughout entirety of forearm and hand distal to the elbow. Above the elbow, sensation is intact. Vasc: 2&#43; radial pulse, symmetric to contralateral side. BCR &lt;3 sec. Hand is cooler than contralateral side. Lab: CRP &lt;5, ESR 4, CK 31,924, PT 14, INR 1.1, D-dimer 0.46, AST 610, ALT 186, Cr 0.94, WBC 6.3 Imaging: Radiographs of the chest, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand demonstrate no fracture. The shoulder is well located. CTA starting at the heart demonstrate no vascular abnormalities. Assessment: unlikely that he has compartment syndrome or a cervical spine pathology. His exam does not localize to one specific innervation or muscle group. His paresthesias and diffuse 3/5 weakness on exam may be related to parsonage turner syndrome (post viral neuritis) versus edema. While he does have a cool hand and mild/moderate edema on exam, his CTA is normal and his exam is very reassuring that this is not compartment syndrome. He likely has rhabdomyolysis based on upper arm swelling in the setting of CK of 31924.   Discharge 2/22/2021: He received a total of 3 liters of IV fluids and was encouraged to drink large amounts of water. Repeat CK levels showed to be down trending as were his AST and ALT enzymes. Plain radiographs of his left arm and shoulder were unremarkable as was CT angiography of his chest. Electrolytes and renal lab work was within normal limits throughout the hospitalization.On the day of discharge, he was tolerating a PO diet, ambulating without difficulty, and hemodynamically stable. LUE w/ minimal swelling, no erythema. TTP over L triceps belly, No TTP over the distal LUE. Somewhat decreased sensation to light touch over distal LUE. 2&#43; radial pulses b/l. LUE ROM somewhat limited 2/2 pain, but intact. ---- to f/u with HCP in 2 weeks, sooner if worse (medical officer)   CK 2/22/21 was down to 14653

                                                Approximately 7-10 days or so after receiving the first dose of the pfizer Covid vaccine I started to develop this red, nodule-like, painful &#34;rash&#34; on both of my forearms. Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like &#34;rash&#34; along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior. The initial presumption at this time is that the clots are vaccine-related, but could be linked to an underlying blood disorder that was triggered by the vaccine. Blood hyper coagulation labs have not yet come back. I was initiated on Eliquis starting April 12th for the DVT.

Body fatigue, temperature varying from low 99 F up to 101.3 F. These symptoms subsided after about 2 days. Also developing during this time was an asthma attack, characterized by wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Patient has had life-long history of asthma, moderate, well-maintained with albuterol inhaler (life-long) and Qvar redihaler (beginning in early-mid 2020). However, after the common symptoms subsided, the asthma attack prolonged for over a week (2nd injection on 22 Apr 2021, and present as of reporting (03 May 2021). Albuterol inhaler would ease the wheezing, but no effect on mitigating the coughing / difficulty breathing. Qvar redihaler had no effect. Asthma attack would alternate in waves (approximately every hour up to 4-6 hour cycles), of breathing mostly clearly (some difficulty persisting), and severe attacks when extremely difficult to breathe.

The following day my neck felt as if there was a lump in it, probably from swollen lymph nodes. As days pass I had several sinus attacks, Acid reflux, and being weak in general. Which I dont regularly have. I am still experiencing a lump like feeling in my throat.

Around 6am I measured my axillary temperature to be 100.9 F and took 650 Tylenol once which broke the fever. I was unable to go in to work that day. Now, two days after the vaccine, my other symptoms have resolved aside from a painful, and visibly noticable, lymph adenopathy in my left arm pit the same side as the vaccine.

                                                This 24 yo male reports receipt of his first Pfizer Covid vaccine lot #EN6199 to his Left deltoid.  He advised within &lt;15 minutes following the vaccine he sensed the left side of his neck was swelling.  He notified Immunization staff who brought him to the ER via w/c. He stated the ERMD did not perceive/palpate any swelling or nodules, and treated him with IV Benadryl with resolution of s/s.  He did not require any other doses of benadryl.    He received his 2nd Pfizer covid vaccine on 3/30/2021 lot#ER8734 to right deltoid.  He stated within 15 min again, he had the sensation of throat stiffness (as if muscles really tight/tensed) and this made it difficult to breath and caused his chest to hurt. He was taken to the ER again and given Benadryl again with resolution of symptoms. He was released later without any reoccurrence of symptoms. He states he went to work on 3/31 where he began to feel bad/achy-feverish.  Today he had a fever (not taken), total body aches but mostly to his left hand.  He reports feeling fatigue and unable to do normal AM routine of working out.  He could only stretch today.  He denies any trauma, recent illness, difficulty breathing, swallowing, eating, ha, n/v/d, or other symptoms.

My arm was swollen for about 3 days, I couldn?t move my arm for almost a whole week. My muscles were very weak in the arm and hurt to put pressure on it and couldn?t lift my arm. It has gotten better but it has now been 3 weeks and I am still experiencing some muscle pain and weakness in my left shoulder. The shit was administered in my left arm  directly below my shoulder bone.  I still can?t move my arm to shoulder height or higher with feeling pain and weakness in the muscle.

                                                The patient reported that they were experiencing tightness in their arm and believed it swelled initially. They left the pharmacy area and went to get Tylenol that was recommended by the pharmacist. They then began to get lightheaded and had syncope, attempted to get back up and the cashier asked to if they wanted to sit, but fell again. It was not clear initially to the employee who was helping them they had received the vaccine. 911 was called and the employee helping them let the pharmacist know they had just gotten their vaccine. The immunizing pharmacist went to check on the patient. EMTs were already helping the patient and had taken his blood pressure which was normal the lightheadedness had stopped and both sitting and standing blood pressure was the same. He had an elevated heart rate per the patient but didn&#39;t know any of the numbers the EMTs had taken. His father was driving him. He was not experiencing any symptoms and the injection site had no swelling and was otherwise unremarkable.

A 25-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3247), administered in left arm, on 27Jan2021 at 09:30 AM (at the age of 25-years-old) at 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies: pollen. No COVID prior vaccination and no COVID tested post vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccine received in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient reported that his lymph node above the left shoulder blade was swollen on 30Jan2021 at 08:30 AM. He went to receive an ultrasound in 2021 to confirm. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was received due to the event. The patient then received the second dose of BNT162b2 (lot number: EL3247) on 17Feb2021 at 08:30 AM, administered in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was recovering from the event.

That morning he had noticed increased substernal chest pressure associated with palpitations, nausea, diaphoresis, and left arm tingling. He notes that early last year he was very sick and though he had COVID but confirmatory testing was not available at that time. After recovering from the illness he noted that he had occasionally episodes of chest pressure and palpitations. However yesterday was the worst his symptoms have ever been. He did receive his 2nd COVID vaccine this past Saturday and experienced fatigue, nausea, weakness.  In the ED patient has HD stable, afebrile, saturating well on RA. Labs were notable for troponin of 5.2 which trend down to 3.1. ESR WNL, CRP elevated 2.4. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with signs suggestive of possible pericarditis. CXR negative. CTA showed no pulmonary embolism, enlarged and prominent left axillary lymph nodes, nonspecific, cholelithiasis. Patient admitted for NSTEMI. Enlarged axillary lymph nodes likely reactive in the setting of recent COVID vaccine.    Cardiology consulted. Patient underwent cardiac cath which was unremarkable. Cardiology recommends short course NSAIDs for possible pericarditis, however EKG changes unimpressive per cardiology. Discharged home on ibuprofen 400 mg TID for 5 days. Advise follow up with PCP within 1 week.

                                                Patient developed sudden onset of fevers and malaise on 5/7/21 (26 days after his 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine).  His symptoms progressed to involve shortness of breath which prompted his admission to our Hospital on 5/12/21.  He rapidly deteriorated requiring intubation and ultimately placement on ECMO and temporary internal heart pump (Impella device) placement.  He was thought to have myocarditis due to elevated troponins at the time of admission and cardiac MRI showing wide spread myocardial inflammation suggestive of myocarditis.   He was treated with high dose steroids and supportive care due to the concern for cytokine storm and eventually started to show signs of improvement.   He was eventually taken off ECMO, internal heart pump and ventilatory support and went home after 20 days in the hospital.  However, follow up cardiac MRI revealed ongoing myocarditis, but his ejection fraction had improved.

A 25-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 16Mar2021 at 03:15 PM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. Concomitant medications included ZYRTEC D for unknown indication from an unspecified date. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 16Mar2021 at 03:30 PM the patient experienced pain in arm, light headed (waited the recommended 15 minutes and left), numbness in face, breathing difficulty, neck pain (immediately went back to the facility that administrated the shot, was put under observation), cheek swelling, throat swelling and tingling. Treatment received for the events included diphenhydramine and Tylenol. The clinical outcome of the events pain in arm, light headed, numbness in face, breathing difficulty, neck pain, cheek swelling, throat swelling and tingling was resolving.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                throat fell really tight. They told him was throat was closing up.; Anaphylaxis/anaphylactic shock/severe allergic reaction; Swelling of the throat/throat was swelling; Trouble breathing; Itchy throat; Said that his throat felt really thirsty.; He is very upset./He is pretty devastated.; His throat started to do it again.; They said maybe it was something he ate or maybe sinuses; This is spontaneous report from contactable consumer (patient) and contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 25-year-old male patient received the first dose for BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot No. EWO187) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 19May2021 at 12:00 or 13:00. Relevant history included Diabetes, obesity, endocrine abnormalities, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, respiratory illness, compromised immune status and Allergies. The patient had Allergies to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that can induce anaphylactic shock, severe reaction, swelling of face and throat. Relevant concomitant drug was unknown. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Additional Vaccines were Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect If applicable. No Vaccines were Administered prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Family Medical History was none. About 3-5 minutes after being administered the Vaccine, the patient immediately developed anaphylactic shock. He was transported via ambulance to the Emergency Room on 19May2021 where he verified he was admitted to the hospital Emergency room for about 5-6 hours and discharged from the hospital the same day, 19May2021. He was told not to get any additional doses.  He was still having swelling of the throat and went back to the ER today and was given a steroid prednisone 40mg a day for 5 days.  He was advised to take benadryl also.  He said he didn&#39;t get any IVs or anything.  He had a past medical history of anaphylactic reaction to NSAIDS.  He has been advised not to get the second dose. The patient stated the anaphylactic shock occurred with trouble breathing, throat was swelling and itchy throat. He did go into ER, they told him to just keep drinking fluids, that there was nothing else they could really do. When he was seen in the emergency room they gave him Benadryl and a steroid: Prednisone for now which he is on for the next couple of days. He was told that after 2 days or something, that after getting injected that he wouldn&#39;t have any symptoms-but he is still having those pretty severe symptoms of anaphylactic shock. Initial onset of anaphylactic shock was about 3-5 minutes after Pfizer Covid Vaccine shot was administered. Within 10-15 minutes he had swelling of tongue and throat and difficulty breathing. They called an ambulance, the ambulance took him to the Hospital emergency room where he was admitted and discharged that same date on 19May2021 after about 5-6 hours; he reported discharge time was around 16:40. They told him to come back if he had any issues that occurred over next couple of days or worsening or causing problems; to call back the nurses line. He was on a lot of Benadryl, a lot of antihistamines. When he gets off the antihistamines almost all the allergic reactions of the anaphylactic shock reoccur. This morning, 21May2021, he didn&#39;t take any Bendaryl before bed, and this morning when he woke up he was alright. After being at work like 30 minutes he felt the itchiness; scratchy throat; swelling of tongue; a little swelling of the throat; difficulty breathing. He took Benadryl and called the hotline who told him to call the Emergency room, he called the emergency room and went there. He talked to them this morning because he went to work and had issues breathing. He called and they told him to come in asap, so he went in to the emergency room; they gave him Benadryl and told him there was nothing else they could do other than him taking the steroid: Prednisone. The patient was in the hospital 3 days and will be day 4 tomorrow. He was trying to figure out how long this will last. They told him to talk to his doctor. They basically told him they were not responsible. The patient&#39;s mother reported that her son received the shot Wed 19May2021. Does not know if the Walgreen&#39;s reported this. He left there in an ambulance within 10 minutes of getting the shot. They took him to the emergency room and he got mixed information. He went back again today. They blew him off and told him maybe it was something he ate. She assumed that an allergic reaction would be about 24 hours but this is day 3. She is scared he may be taking too much Benadryl. He said he felt like he needed something to drink. Said that his throat felt really thirsty. He went back inside since his throat fell really tight. They told him was throat was closing up. They saw that his throat was swollen and they called the paramedics. Within 15 minutes they came and brought him to the emergency room.  Nobody had given him Epi. They were going to give it to him an Epi pen  but he wanted to wait for the paramedics. He was freaking out. The paramedics showed up and they were unable to give him Epi, stating he didn&#39;t have hives. He only received Benadryl. They he had to have to give him extra Benadryl because whatever they gave him in the IV because the first didn&#39;t work and his throat was still closing up. It made him feel like a drug addict asking for Benadryl.  She was not sure if they gave him Benadryl in the ambulance, knows that it was given in the emergency room. The Benadryl may have been started in the ambulance but she is not sure. They did give him oxygen in the ambulance. Clarified he was in the ER over 4 hours, but was not admitted to the hospital. They gave him steroids but forgot to send him home with steroids. He had to call to find out about getting them and they told him they forgot to send the prescription in. He was late starting the next dose of steroids. He went back to the ER today, day 3. He didn&#39;t feel too bad today and went to work. After exerting a little energy and moving around, his throat started to do it again. He didn&#39;t have Benadryl on him. He left work because he thought it was going to close up again the day he got the shot. Once he calmed down, he took Benadryl. He called the hospital to ask if this was  normal. He was told that it is not normal and was told that if he still felt bad, to come to the hospital. They said maybe it was something he ate or maybe sinuses. He spoke to one of the doctors. They had never shown him how to use an ePi pen. He does not know how long this will last. He gets scared. Treatment: Has only been taking Benadryl. He started the steroids yesterday and today. They had given him Benadryl today in the ER and he is home now. The patient visited to the Emergency room twice, first time by ambulance, confirmed he was not admitted. He was pretty devastated. The outcome of events was unknown.
