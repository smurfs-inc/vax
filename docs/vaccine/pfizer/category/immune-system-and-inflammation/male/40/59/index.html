The patient has no medical history and concomitant medications.  The physician reported that he got the COVID Vaccine on 18Dec2020 and he got Lymphadenopathy as a possible side effect of the vaccine. It was recently (03Jan2021), he noticed an enlarged lymph node (Lymph node is on left supraclavicular, so above the clavicle on the left side). It could be unrelated, but he was told to call and report it. He would like to know were there patients in the clinical trial who got lymphadenopathy (which part of the body). He did not received treatment. He knows that lymphadenopathy was reported in the study. The reported considered the event as non-serious. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The first couple days I had a really sore left arm, but didn?t feel any ?side effects? until about Wednesday, 1/6 (about a week later). I remember waking up to a sore left side of my upper body. The left side of my neck, chest, arm, and lymph node (under my left arm) felt weird. It was until about Saturday night, 1/9, that I felt my left under arm lymph node noticeably swollen. I had a bad headache and loss of energy, and overall feeling unwell. No fever or night sweats to report. I was absent from work on 1/11 and 1/12, as a result.  1/13 was my first day back and feel better. The swollen left lymph node is no longer present, but still slightly tired. I did not seek Medical Care for my symptoms.

By 10hrs, I started with varying chills/sweats that lasted all night, injection site soreness, and soreness in left breast area. The next day I was extremely exhausted and had trouble staying awake. Muscle aches in both shoulders and neck. Also had varying fever from 100 up to 104.1 throughout the day. At 36hrs after injection. I took 2 Advil to help with the muscle aches...nothing taken to this point. 48hrs After injection some energy returned, but still lethargic throughout the day, and occasion fever between 100-101. During shower, I noticed swelling under my left armpit, not present on the right side. At 60hrs after injection, fever gone, energy returned...lingering soreness of left shoulder and breast area and swelling under left armpit remains.  At no point did I have any breathing or lung issues...but otherwise it felt like I had a bad flu (minus the coughing/wheezing) for 2 days.

                                                Starting at 8pm on vaccination day I got loopy and disoriented, and had a hard time speaking intelligibly.  I also had trouble with balance and fine motor skills.  Had some personality changes too: became very moody with erratic mood swings. The next day I slept all day because of exhaustion and aches. When I woke up on Wednesday (36hrs later) I was literally screaming in pain because of how bad my arm and shoulder hurt. It hurt to move it, and hurt not to move it.  It was excruciating and ibuprofen didn&#39;t seem to help at all. Throughout Wednesday I could hardly move my left arm. Getting dressed or washing my hair was very difficult and very painful.  I was also still very uncoordinated. My left armpits lymph nodes were so swollen that (1) it filled in my entire armpit so there was no more pit, just a very soft bulge, and (2) the fluid extended all the way to my chest and it looked like I had one breast and one pec.

                                                Developed severe abdominal cramps on my left side around 7 p.m. on Wednesday, April 28. Cramps were intermittent and in varying degrees of intensity. Cramps continued through Friday, April 30 with varying intensity. Attempted to treat with Tylenol and GasX.  Starting around 10:30 a.m. on Saturday May, 1, the pain in my left side increased in intensity and was not waning. After consulting with a telehealth practitioner, I  went to the emergency room and was quickly admitted. My blood and urine were tested, along with CT scans of my body. The CT scan revealed that blood was no longer reaching two parts of my left kidney and I was diagnosed with a arterial thrombosis.   I was fully admitted to the hospital and a heparin drip was immediately started.

So, it was between his armpit his heart where he felt the bubble; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (parent). A 40-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 (at the age of 40-year-old) as single dose indicated to prevent from Corona virus (Covid-19 Immunization). Medical history included seizures and gout. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included unspecified medication for seizures. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: ER8730) on 24Mar2021 for Covid-19 Immunization. The patient got the second Pfizer shot later this month, left the office, 45 minutes later (on 14Apr2021) he had seizures and ended up in emergency room. He has had small seizures but they are not back to back, of and on throughout the years and now we are saying that maybe COVID Vaccine shot is what provoked him to, what made him had seizures. Reporter stated, even though he has had seizures in the past like it could be 2, 3 years apart for one. But the shot it caused him to have another seizure, but he is not going to continue to have seizures, as he is on medication (unspecified medication) right now. But the medication is on, if they take him off it, he could have multiple seizures constantly (name of medication not clarified further). Also on 14Apr2021, the patient also had a scar in left arm, it is another symptom he had. He had the scar in his left arm before he had a seizure, he said over here between his heart and his arm felt like a (incomplete sentence), now they don&#39;t know if he had a one scar or what it says but he says that &#39;he could feel a bump, it was like a bump in there. So, it was between his armpit his heart where he felt the bubble&#39; (not clarified further).  The patient underwent laboratory test which included: blood work, a urine sample and they did a CAT scan to see knowing the problem in his brain, all on 14Apr2021 with unknown result. The day of the test was on the 14th, it would have been on a Wednesday. It was the same day that he got the second shot. So, he had these test done on 14Apr (14Apr2021). Reporter confirmed of getting the test results on Thursday, so did not have the details. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of seizures which included Levetiracetam 500 mg tablet, he takes one tablet twice a day, so he takes two tablets a day. This was ordered by his doctor in emergency room. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 40-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0164) administered in left deltoid via an unknown route of administration on 16Apr2021 at 12:50 pm as 1st dose single for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that that he received the vaccine in his left arm, the bicep muscle, or above the bicep. He states the muscle on the shoulder area. Patient states that asthma was in the lungs and chest. He has had mild intermittent asthma and gets it 4 times a year. There was no prior Vaccinations, no adverse events within 4 weeks. Medical history included asthma (patient was diagnosed 30 years ago), allergic to shellfish. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Apr2021 patient experienced is there any correlation between the delated anaphylaxis and ingredient, throat tightening with difficulty breathing (Throat tightness and dyspnea), less of a passageway, fair amount of coughing/dry cough swelling in the neck area and fatigue. On 19Apr2021 at 10:15 HCP indicated tracheitis. The patient states that he got the vaccine on 16Apr2021 at 12:50 pm and isn&#39;t sure exactly when the swelling started because he got a little fatigued. Patient states that it was about 3-5 hours after and at a certain point he noticed it. It was reported that a half an hour to an hour later patient throat started to tighten, it gets triggered by certain stimuli, steam and vocalization, and rubbing the area. patient states that he could reproduce the issue if he rubs the area, the frequency has decreased, and in that case, it has improved. It was reported that patient was diagnosed with tracheitis on 19Apr2021 at 10:15 and it was still ongoing, or the effects of it are. Patient states that what he feels in the front of his throat near the trachea and up a little further was inflammation. Patient gets the symptoms of the tightening of the throat, and it is inflamed there is less area to breath. Patient states that his understanding of the tightening of the throat and dry cough are all symptoms of the tracheitis. It was reported that the first symptom experienced after the injection (at least 2-3 -4 hours), patient had fatigue first then probably a half an hour to an hour later the swelling started. patient believes the fatigue has gone away, but not 100 percent sure. patient states that there are times he has felt fatigue and is not 100 percent of the cause. patient states that if he does feel fatigue, he assumes it because of the tracheitis. patient states that these events happen when he needs to get area in his throat, and it might cause the fatigue. patient states that the coughing is parallel with the throat tightening, when he wants to open his airway or pass way the coughing seems to occur. Patient states he gets relief or a more open passageway and the coughing reflex or coughing bouts are less, when he gets the tightness of the throat or the inflammation he sort of goes into coughing. The outcome of the event for hcp indicated tracheitis was not recovered and unknown for the other events, whereas the outcome of the event fatigue was recovered.

                                                Immediate nausea, hot flash and heart palpitations at time of injection, soreness for 3 days, and on the 4th day I had a general feeling of malaise, which worsened until I developed a fever. Severe fatigue and constant fever as high as 105 for three days, and finally went to the ER. Immediately treated for sepsis. Full blood panel, blood cultures, x-ray and CT scan. Also ran some additional cultures for respiratory  pathogens. The Dr?s had a tough time determining what it was. They saw a very small area which they called pneumonia, however, I?ve had pneumonia and this was not what it was. Final discharge paperwork stated Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

                                                A small rash approximately 2 cm in diameter appeared on my right anterior thigh about 4 inches above the knee.  It started off red and mildly itchy with significant warmth compared to the surrounding area.  A day or two later a similar rash appeared on my left wrist and posterior forearm that presented as raised bumps but was similarly itchy.  Another day later a similar rash appeared on my right posterior forearm.  I then decided to contact a telehealth provider who reviewed via video and decided to prescribe over-the-counter anti-histamine (zyrtec) and a topical ointment of mupirocin.  I continued to take the zyrtec and applied the ointment but over the last several days the rash on my leg has increased in size to 20cm x 15 cm with noticeable swelling, itchiness and mild aching pain.  Another noteworthy symptom is the area of the original rash on my thigh deepened in color and is now scaly and less itchy.

                                                Since my 2nd dose of my Covid shot, I experienced an inflamed lymph node in my left armpit. It lasted about a week and eventually passed. But since that event, I have been experiencing sharp pains on the left side of my body (arms, legs, buttocks), such as shocks, tingling, and numbness in my extremities. If I lift my left arm up, I get the sensation the arm and hand is falling alseep. But it&#39;s not the normal falling asleep sensation, more of a shocking pain running to my hands. My buttocks/back thigh area is constantly cramping up.

                                                I received the first vaccine without a single side effect. However, the evening after receiving my second dose, I began to get chills, a fever of 101.7, and night sweats. The next morning I woke up to two rashes on my chest. I continued to experience chills, a fever of 102, and the rash now covers my entire body, including my face. The rash is painful, itchy, and bumpy. This is day two. I have swollen lymph nodes in my neck. The urgent care I saw today told me to watch my throat to make sure it doesn&#39;t close up.

I have sporadically experienced ringing in my Right ear as well but not nearly to the extent I have in my left ear. I also experienced frequent, daily headaches for about the first month or so after the shot. I also experienced neck/right shoulder stiffness for about 3 weeks following the shot. I continue to wake up on a daily basis with a feeling in my head and ears like I&#39;ve been listening to loud music or been in a loud sporting event for several hours (on top of the still nonstop/constant ringing in my left ear that will not go away). I have also experienced swelling in my feet and ankles anytime i&#39;m active for an extended period of time

A 42-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Lot #: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 (at the age of 42-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not have any known allergies. The patient did not receive any other medications within two weeks prior to the vaccination and did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 30Jan2021 the patient experienced swelling, red spots and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;two weeks after my COVID-19 vaccination I noticed swelling, red spots, and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it. I visited my podiatrist who recommended NSAIDs for a week. Today, my sister in law who is a nurse said it looked like COVID toes. When I googled an image of COVID toes, the spots looked identical to my own.&#34; The adverse events required a physician office visit. The patient received treatment for the events which included NSAIDs. The clinical outcomes of the events swelling, red spots and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it were all not recovered/not resolved. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Was rushed to hospital where I was admitted very quickly. I was blacking out on the drive there and blacked out while in their care. This was from one dose of Pfizer vaccine for Covid. I was put on a GI, Allergy, and steroid medications. I was hooked up to an IV and 3 drugs were injected. I passed out numerous times but was discharged at 5am.

                                                I got my 2nd shot on March 26th.  On Monday March 29th 6:00pm, my elbows started to itch and develop hives/rashes.  Then my knees and then foot and hands by the night.  It was burning and itching and it swelled up a little. Oddly the itchiness and redness goes away and then comes.  Taking Allegra does help but its not making the symptoms go away.

                                                I had a strange feeling in the left side of my face that I wasn&#39;t sure if it was a reaction or not.  It happened within the first 15 minutes but did not last more than 30 minutes.  I did not experience anything else until the first evening when my arm was very sore.  The next day my arm was more sore and I had a mild circular red mark around the injection site and the arm was much harder on that side.  I also felt a little in my back and neck.  By the second day in the evening the only thing I felt was pain in the arm which eventually traveled into my armpit by day 3.  It wasn&#39;t until day 5 that all the pain was completely gone.  I may have experienced fatigue the first two days also.

On Tuesday, March 30, 2021 my entire leg swelled  to twice its normal size at which time I went to the emergency room and a blood clot was diagnosed in my right leg. I completed a multitude of tests and bloodwork with a hematologist and there are no factors or reasons they can identify as to why I developed a blood clot.

By 9:30 PM on the night of 4/3 the large right toe had swollen and was unable to move.  By the morning of 4/4/2021 no pressure could be placed on the right foot without extreme pain.  Pain reached highest pain by 4/7/2021 and has slowly tapered but remains.  Swelling has reduced to point where a lose shoe can be placed over foot and some walking can occur with effort.   Joint pain continues in shoulders, knees and hips.  I become winded after walking only a few hundred feet.  (typically jog 2 miles/day and walk an additional 5 miles)

He said the rest of the week he didn&#39;t feel quite right.  A week after the vaccine he started with red capillary veins popping up all over his legs. By Saturday his legs were purple and swollen. He has multiple tests run at the hospital. They doctor believes it is vasculitis that has resulted from patient getting the covid vaccine.

Paced around my house and backyard in a fog, confused, not clear of thought. Had a hard time spelling words in emails. Symptoms went away within 45-60 minutes and did not return. Since that time felt a little tired but nothing serious. Today I feel completely normal.

                                                Almost 3 weeks ago I received my 2nd Pfizer vaccination for COVID. I had some swelling in my armpit. A hard bump also appeared between my right leg and crotch. My armpit feels 100%, but the bump has not gone away. Concerned, I wanted to get it checked out. I set up an appointment for the earliest possible, 6-29-2021.

Pt states that after receiving his 2nd dose on 05/06, he noticed his leg stiffness got significantly worse. He tells me that he tried to &#34;push through the pain&#34; and mow his lawn but had to stop d/t severe cramping of the LLE and pelvis. He states he rested his leg and went to bed, and when he woke up he noticed that his left leg was severely swollen. Pt decided to take 3 days off work to continue to rest the leg, but ultimately came in for evaluation at the suggestion of his coworkers. Pt denies fever, chills, chest pain, or SOB. He denies history of smoking, prior clotting, long car travel, air travel, leg injury, or recent surgery.    On exam, the left lower extremity is significantly swollen, erythematous, and hot to the touch. Physical exam otherwise unremarkable. Will admit to the hospitalist service for further medical management.   ED Course: Hypertensive with BP 170/93. Initial workup significant for WBC 13, K 3.3, glucose 159. CT chest/a/p with findings suggestive of multiple PE&#39;s of the left and right lower lobes as well as extensive LLE DVT extending slightly into the IVC. Trop &lt;0.03. BNP 66. ECG shows sinus tachycardia.

It isn&#39;t as bad as it was but definitely painful. The upper back pain has came back and isn&#39;t terrible painful but is uncomfortable. Pain in most of my joints: knees, elbow, fingers... Most noticeable in my knees. (I weigh 150 pounds). I have been tired a lot. I did not have any issues with the bells palsy in my face. I received allergy shots for years and stopped getting them when I had surgery. After the surgery, I started getting the allergy shots again, it made me swell and my back pains were increased because of it. So I stopped getting them. So the issue may be that the COVID shot is making me swell.

A 42-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Lot Number: ER8735), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 15Apr2021 at 15:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had not received other vaccinations on the same dates as when he got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine injections, or in the four weeks prior. The patient also stated that he has not started new medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Mar2021 (lot number: EP6955) at 15:30 in his left arm for COVID-19 immunization. On 18Apr2021, 3 days after the patient got his second dose his feet were numb, they felt like they were asleep, which progressed from his feet up his legs to his stomach and chest area, then to arms and hands. It has stayed the same since it got to his arms. He says he is probably on day 22 at the time of the report. He says he got to see a neurologist and he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome. The patient reported that there has been no treatment and was told that it has to run its course. The patient was not hospitalized for the event. He says he just wanted to report that and that he was also curious if others have been reporting that. He says he has never experienced this before, he was very healthy and never had any symptoms with vaccines before, this is all brand new to him. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                I had an acute anaphylactic reaction to a yellow jacket sting.  Within 20 minutes of the sting, my whole body was swollen and airways began to constrict.  I received epinephrine, type 1 and 2 antihistamines, and steroids, and the symptoms resolved.  I am reporting this because I was stung by a yellow jacket in the same location a year earlier (pre-vaccine) and had no reaction.  I had never had an anaphylactic reaction.  Clearly, other factors could have caused the new response to what appears to be the same stimulus, but receiving an MRNA vaccine designed to stimulate immune response seems like a suspect worth investigating.

Ears became full with fluid and pressure then extreme tinnitus developed.  My regular doctor prescribed 2 different antibiotics which had zero effect on tinnitus. It is  almost 12 weeks after the tinnitus began and I still have ringing in the ears. It has reduced to 50% over the 3 months. I have never experienced this symptom previously and it has become the worst health event in my life.  I have not been exposed to any loud sounds. I have been to see 2 ENTs and they believe the condition is permanent. I had a CT scan completed and it shows there are no issues. I am hoping it is inflammation and will go away over time.   I am currently taking Prednisone and hoping it reduces any possible inflammation.  The ringing and popping noises in my ears need to stop ASAP.

I went to see my PCP who performed exams, lab work, x-rays, CT scan of the head, CT scan of the abdomen and my doctor does not find anything wrong for me. To this day I continue wit the headaches that do not go away. I do not feel well to do my daily living activities and I get anxiety.  I feel very tense and frustrated due to my symptoms.  I do not have the lot # for my vaccines to provide.

Vital signs were assessed by a Registered Nurse and a Physician. Oxygen saturation was noted to be 88% on 2 liters of O2 by nasal cannula. Verbal order received at 10:03am from Physician and EpiPen administered to right thigh with improvement of symptoms. She was transferred to the Emergency Department (ED) via stretcher. In the ED, she was re-dosed with an EpiPen secondary to her airway type symptoms. She was reevaluated after 15 minutes and received Solu-Medrol, Pepcid, Benadryl IV, as well as IV fluids. She also received Ativan for her generalized jitteriness and anxiety. She improved and felt significantly better at approximately 11:43am. She was monitored for 3 hours in the ED and was discharged home at 3:34pm in good clinical condition and advised to continue to take Benadryl as needed. She carries and EpiPen on her person and was advised to return immediately if symptoms return.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

Then 48 hours later, her left axilla has become very swollen and painful. The pain has subsided but remains mild and swelling persists. The area seems to show fluid accumulation in the subcutaneous tissue but no erythema or e/o [evidence of (pending confirmation)] abscess infection noted. It&#39;s now been present for 4 days. The patient received treatment which included NSAIDs. The patient had not been COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                anaphylaxis; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable healthcare professional (patient himself). A 43-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced anaphylaxis in Jan2021. The outcome of the event was unknown.   No follow up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation and known safety profile of suspect drug. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

In addition, the morning after the injection I woke up with a bright red face rash and draining on the left nostril, the left eye crusted shut with yellowish drainage, a red blister-like spot on the left lower eyelid, bloodshot eye, and swelling from the eyelid and down into the cheek. The swelling got worse after a couple of days, leading to medical treatment with eye drops and an antibiotic.

                                                Shingles.  I received the second dose of covid vaccine on Wed, April 28. Three days later, Saturday May 1,  I woke up with intense abdominal pain, spanning the entirety of my stomach, and wrapping around my right oblique and kidney area. I had thrown out my back one week prior,  assumed this was more muscle pain, and treated it as such.   The Monday following, May 3, I went to the chiropractor, still in intense pain, but also with a tingling sensation on the affected area, sensitivity to the touch without pain. I assumed that I had burned myself with the heating pad.  Wednesday a rash began to form in the affected area. My pain was nearly gone, I no longer felt muscle tightness, and assumed that the condition was resolving itself, and that the rash was heat rash from the heating pad.   Friday the rash was redder and my abdomen showed signs of significant swelling. I still thought this was muscular, that perhaps I had pulled the abdomen, treated with ice and decided to visit Orthopedic urgent care Saturday.  Saturday the pain had increased. I went to Urgent care, and was told I have shingles. I asked if the covid vaccine could have caused shingles to flare, was told &#34;theoretically&#34;, but thar we do not really know enough to say whether the vaccine contributed, or whether it was coincidence.  At home, I read a bit on the covid vaccine qnd shingles, saw what appeared to be anti-vaccer propaganda, but also read about this self-reporting system...so, I thought that I might as well submit my info.

                                                Developed right neck swelling/adenopathy which spread to the left.  Significant to impair neck mobility.  Developed high fevers roughly 12 hours later with rigors.  Was seen in the emergency department.  Found to be febrile, significantly tachycardic (sinus) .  Was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone empirically.  Felt ill for the next 48 hours afterwards with weakness, slow to resolve tachycardia and cough.  Neck swelling subsided however, right neck lymphadenopathy persisted for well over a month.  Was sent home from ED with Bactrim and keflex for coverage of possible neck cellulitis.  However, I do not believe it was a cellulitis.  Neck was not tender, not indurated nor erythematous.  I am a hospitalist and had colleagues take a look as well.

Since receiving the vaccine, he has experienced multiple side effects at varying time points: pain at injection site left shoulder (experienced pain first day of receiving vaccine on 28Dec2020 and couple of days after fever (unspecified date) resolved (on an unspecified date); he was currently experiencing intermittent minimal pain especially when he wakes up; feels something is different; fever (experienced 08Jan2021); fatigue (developed 07Jan2021). He went to the ER on 08Jan2021 when he developed fever, nausea and shortness of breath which also resolved that day. When he went to ER, his CRP was up a little at 1.1. His PCR and antigen test was negative at that time (08Jan2021); a retest of PCR done 5 days after sxs started (unclear of time window) was negative. He was concerned that he had the fever many days after the vaccine. HCP was asking if any cases of fever and fatigue reported after 7 days (around the 10 day mark) of receiving the first dose. He stated that he is planning on taking the second dose. The patient is a physician calling about the Pfizer covid vaccine. He received his first dose on 28Dec2020.

He had tachycardia, nausea and shortness of breath. He was not admitted, stated his fever was controlled and his breathing was better. His oxygen was 100% and everything was ok and he was sent home. In the ER he had xrays and labs and everything was ok, except his CRP was a bit up. In the ER he had an antigen and pcr covid test (08Jan2021) and they both came back negative. About 4 or 5 days after the symptoms started, he had an outpatient repeat pcr test and nucleic acid rapid test (unspecified dates) and they both came back negative. He is on his way to get his second dose and he is asking if the symptoms could be side effects from the vaccine. Outcome the event fever was recovered on an unspecified date. Outcome of nausea and shortness of breath was recovered on 08Jan2021, while outcome of pain at injection site left shoulder was recovered on 28Dec2020. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

But i was very sick with my stomach and had issues breathing in late 2019 and again early 2020, took medication (antibiotics) both times.   I had to write on this form over and over again kept getting frozen with error from the PDF. Even if I hit OK, it keeps popping up and does not let me finish, so I can imagine that lots of people gave up, like I may. Pfizer 4/13/2021 EW0162. After 5pm Pfizer 5/04/2021 EW0170. After 2pm

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Mar2021 at around 13:00 or 13:30 (at the age of 44 years old) (Lot Number: EP7534, unknown expiration) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020; sneezing and runny nose both on 21Mar2021. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient reported that he received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 22Mar2021. He felt fine after receiving the vaccine, but there was little bit rash on arms just afterwards and felt maybe a little restless but felt fine and went for a walk on 22Mar2021. As the night went on, he really noticed how sore his arm was/pain in his arm and when he was sleeping, he had trouble sleeping/problems with sleep (Mar2021) and felt movements in his chest at times (Mar2021). It felt like he had COVID all over again and had chills, soreness, and his smell was kind of gone in Mar2021. He was previously feeling pretty good. He had COVID-19 in Nov2020, and his symptoms feel very similar including loss of sense of smell but no coughing. He had a fever but that has gone away in Mar2021 and he did not take aspirin or anything for it. He also had fatigue, some swollen in lymph nodes, and his heart rate accelerated in Mar2021.  He had sneezing and runny nose the day prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient would like to know if his symptoms are related to the vaccine or if he possibly has COVID-19 again.  His symptoms are the same as COVID as far as what he can see, and his symptoms are really high. He would like to know if he can still receive the second dose of the vaccine if he has a positive COVID test after the first dose of the vaccine. The patient mentioned that there was very pretty high percentage of people having the symptoms after having the vaccine, kind of virus &#34;causing&#34;.  The patient asked if he needs to be tested to see if he had the virus before he was vaccinated and to know if these are one of the side effects or one of the symptoms of the virus, and to make sure that these are not actually corona virus. The patient recovered from fever in Mar2021, while unknown outcome for the remaining events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Client came to vaccination site at 1715 for his 2nd Pfizer dose on 06/13/21.  After being seated with RN, he expressed concern about receiving his 2nd dose due to the reactions he experienced after receiving his 1st dose.  RN requested Lead RN speak with the client regarding his concerns.  At 1720 Lead RN spoke to client.  Client stated that 1 ½ days after getting his 1st dose, he experienced soreness &amp; tenderness in the axillary area of the left arm.  Client stated that 3 days later his axillary area began swelling.  The swelling continued below his axillary down the left side of his abdomen and onto the left side of his back.  Client stated the pain level was a 4 on a scale of 0-10.  He also stated there was no discoloration or redness in any of the areas where he experienced swelling.  On day 10 the left side of the client?s neck began to swell.  He also started to experience discomfort at the injection site and arm fatigue.  Client stated at no time did he experience any trouble breathing, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  Client stated he has been dieting and lost 145 lbs. in the last year.  He previously had high blood pressure, but no longer does.  He also stated the only other underlying conditions he has is a thyroid problem (hypothyroidism), and he is not medication compliant.

Client takes no other medication, but is allergic to penicillin-based antibiotics.  Client stated he gets dizzy, hallucinates, and swells up in various places on his body.  However, he does not experience shortness of breath or trouble breathing.  Client did not take any medication for the side effects he experienced after receiving his first Pfizer injection or seek medical treatment.  Client stated all the swelling began to subside on day 17.

Prior to RN administering vaccine, Lead RN educated client on normal vs adverse effects of the vaccine.  Lead RN confirmed with client that he has access to a HCP for follow-up, if needed.  Lead RN also recommended client follow-up with his HCP regarding his hyperthyroid condition.  Lead RN instructed client to seek emergency care if he experienced shortness of breath, trouble breathing, or chest pain at any time after leaving the vaccination facility.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN). Thursday evening (14Jan2021), the patient had slight 1-2/10 substernal chest pain on/off. Friday evening around 23:30 (15Jan2021), the patient had chest pain substernal 7-8/10 that lasted for one hour. The burning sensation was worse with cold air. It resolved with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Monday early morning at 04:00 (18Jan2021), the patient experienced STEMI COVID vaccine induced wherein the patient woke up with 10/10 chest pain and shoulder pain which lasted for 30 to 40 minutes and resolved with paracetamol and ibuprofen. The patient also decided to check blood work Monday morning (18Jan2021) while in the hospital. Trop came back 16.28 ng/ml. This is the old trop not high sensitivity. Normal high is 0.30 ng/ml. The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

                                                Fever (100.4F), chills, and muscle ache started within 24 hours and lasted for one day. Took Tylenol which eliminate the fever and all the aforementioned issues were resolved.  The second day noticed swollen painful lymph nodes on the right side of my collarbone (same side of the injection). The issue is still ongoing. Currently, I am taking Ibuprofen and using warm compression to alleviate pain.

Pt refused intubation and was started on BiPAP w/FiO2 of 100%. Given Remdesivir and Decadron. Was placed in ICU. Also covered with zithromax and rocephin which was stopped after procalcitonin found to be normal.  4/1 Pt was weaned off BiPAP to HFNC 4/3 Pt was weaned off HFNC to 4L per NC. From 4/3-4/5 he had significant improvement. On 4/5 did not require O2 at rest but still had desaturation to 88% with ambulation. The team wanted to keep him an additional night but he demanded D/C. He finished 5 day course of Remdesivir prior to D/C and was to finish 10 course of Decadron after discharge

                                                2 days after my second shot I broke out in Hives and welts down my torso, Arms, and legs. I went to urgent care and they gave me a shot of prednisone and gave me a pack of the same steroid to take over the next 6 days they also prescribed some prescription Claritin and Famotidine.. The following day 4/16/21 around 1130pm I woke up to my face being swollen as well as my tongue. I was taken to the ER where the triage unit gave me epinephrine as well as another steroid to stabilize the swelling as I was having trouble breathing. Once stabilized I was released and took 50 mg of Benadryl every 6 hours as well as the Claritin, famotidine, and the prednisone. I had hives for a few days after and followed up with my primary doctor, but as of today I feel like i am back to normal.

                                                Patient reported that he woke up the day after vaccination with a slightly swollen, tender area  about 1 inch X 1/2 inch on the inner aspect of his left leg below the knee (lateral calf muscle). Fearing he had a deep vein thrombosis, he called the ER. I took the call and agreed with the need for evaluation. At the ER he was examined by a physician. No radiology or laboratory tests were performed. He was released with a prescription for Motrin, PO, prn. Follow up call to the patient today (36 hours after discovery of painful area and 56 hours after vaccination) the patient reports no improvement and no worsening of the painful area.

                                                From hospital discharge summary:  &#34;45 y.o. right-hand-dominant male who presents with few hours of improving left arm heaviness/left hand cramping in the setting of getting his second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in his right arm 3 days ago and 3 weeks of mildly increased exercise/intermittent fasting. The patient reports getting his first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination on April 7, 2021. Reports some mild symptoms afterwards. Around that same time, the patient reports having a checkup with his primary care doctor that was notable for a cholesterol elevation to 200. This prompted him to try and lose weight including intermittent fasting and increase in exercise, especially for exercises and cardio.  The patient reports approximately 20 pound weight loss over the past 3 weeks. 3 days ago, the patient reports getting his second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in his right arm.  Reports fever (maximum 103 Fahrenheit) and mild headache the subsequent 2 days after the vaccine.  Last night, the patient went to sleep on his left side at around 8 PM.  He woke up at 4 AM with significant left arm heaviness and left hand cramping.  He tried to massage his hand with some slight improvement of the symptoms but otherwise the symptoms persisted.  Hence, this morning, he called his PCP, who told him to come into the ER for further evaluation. Here, the patient reports improving left arm heaviness/left hand cramping.  He also does report family history of heart attack and an uncle at a similar age and massive heart attack of his grandfather in their 60s. He denies fever, anorexia, unexpected weight change, headache, blurry vision, sinus pressure, cough, hemoptysis, orthopnea, PND, SOB, DOE, chest pain, pleurisy, changes in taste/smell, N/V/D, abdominal pain, flank pain, urinary sxs, genital sxs, black stools, incontinence, absence of flatus, calf pain, leg swelling, numbness/tingling, streaking redness/rash/skin changes, easy bruising. Also, deny history of HTN, DM, smoking, prior MI, prior PCI, prior CABG, prior TIA/CVA, or history of PAD. Further, denies recent trauma/fall, history of cancer, blood thinner use, recent drug use, recent travel, sick contacts, family history of connective tissue disease/congenital aortic anomaly, or family history of similar sxs. --- Hospital Course by Problem  # Troponinemia (Likely myopericarditis)  The patient has a family history notable for MI and CABG in relatives aged 50-70 on his mother&#39;s side. The patient notes that most of these family members were heavy smokers and drinkers, which he is not (never-smoker, rare EtOH, never illicit drugs). His symptoms are notable for L arm heaviness/cramping that began around 8pm on 4/30/21 at 9/10 severity and subsequently was 3-4/10 severity on presentation to ED and is 0-1/10 severity at time of admission to the floor; he has no associated numbness, weakness, coolness, or pallor. His symptoms are non-exertional. He denies CP, SOB, lightheadedness, nausea, jaw pain, abdominal pain, fatigue. He noes that he recently got the second COVID shot in the R arm, and had a post-vaccine course notable for Tmax 103 ~3d ago and 101 as recently as yesterday. His EKG was notable for ST-elevation in II/III/aVF and his troponins were elevated 305 -- &gt; 298 -- &gt; 328. Of note, his CRP was elevated at 69. The patients symptoms and findings could certainly be compatible with atypical ACS and, given the low risk of bleeding associated with heparin, he was treated conservatively upon admission with heparin infusion, metoprolol tartrate 6.25mg q6h, atorvastatin 80mg (he received ASA 325mg in the ED). However, given his recent covid vaccination and elevated CRP and reported fevers, this could also be compatible with myocarditis or other inflammatory etiology.  TTE on 5/3 demonstrated preserved EF 55% with no WMA. Given reassuring TTE, a cMRI was ordered to assess for myocarditis vs scar tissue from recent ischemic event. Cardiac MRI on 5/5 was notable for finding consistent with myopericarditis (see below). Aspirin and atorvastatin was stopped on discharge. Patient was discharged with metoprolol 25 mg daily.&#34;

On Monday the 11th they operated on my left knee because there was a lot of inflammation, that same day the second knee became inflamed, I was hospitalized from April 11 to 17 with a lot of pain in both legs.   On April 21 I continued with a lot of pain and swelling in both legs and even in the ankles there was swelling. A rheumatologist doctor, because of the laboratory tests she conducted, did come to the conclusion that it was reactive arthritis caused by the Pfizer vaccine.   Today June 1, 2021, I still have pain in both knees and ankles, especially the right one, both knees and the right ankle are a little swollen, until May 24 I walked with a walker and I did it with too much pain.

A 45-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0182; Expiration Date: Aug2021, NDC number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19May2021 at 13:00 as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sinus infection in 2011 (for which he visited a doctor 10 years ago to get an antibiotic). Other than that, he was healthy. Patient had no family history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: ER8735; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 28Apr2021 13:00 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Patient had no problems after first dose. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. 6 hours after vaccine, the left side blew up. About 12 hours after the second shot in the middle of the night, patient had the initial reaction and pretty normal side effects (little nausea and fever). Patient had a lymph node inflammation/swelling, which was severe on his left side including his arm pit, down his side, even down into his groin. The reaction died down after about 2 days but spread to rest of the body. On 28May2021, Friday of last week (about 10 days later), everything just blew up. Every one of his lymph nodes went crazy. So many were down in his groin area, the lymph nodes blew up so badly. It was putting enough pressure in that region, it was cutting off circulation to his manhood. Patient had to go to the hospital around 1:00AM. Patient was diagnosed finally at 04:56 and clarified it to be an emergency room visit. Patient was seen in the ER for about 3-4 hours. He was never actually admitted into the hospital. ER doctor believed that patient had a hernia due to the swelling in the lower abdomen. Patient did not know all the tests that were done in the ER. When patient mentioned the swelling that cut off the circulation to manhood, the ER doctor had them ultrasound his manhood, but the doctor never actually listened to the patient. The doctor basically did not want to hear that there were any problems with the vaccine. Patient felt that administration led to lymph node reaction. Instead of sitting in arm for a couple of days or going into a fatty or muscle tissue, vaccine went into the lymph system and now his lymph system was going crazy. He believed this one time when the person jabbed the COVID vaccine in and squeezed the plunger, it put the product right into a lymph node and all of it right into the lymph system. Patient never had a lymph node problem. Patient still had severe lymph node problems. Patient was getting lymphedema in some areas. The only reaction that was abnormal was the extreme lymph node swelling. Outcome of the events was unknown. Investigation Assessment: Yes

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23May2021 12:50 (at age of 45 year old, reported as &#34;was Given: 12:50pm, right before 1:00pm&#34;, Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient not had medical history and family medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 02May2021 12:50 (at age 45 years old, reported as &#34;was Given: 12:50pm, right before 1:00pm&#34;, Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Patient had the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine last Sunday (23May2021). Since then, he thinks he had an allergic reaction to the vaccine. On 26May2021 (Wednesday late morning, early afternoon), he woke up and the left side of his face was all swollen and puffy in the lips, chin and cheek. It started out in the lower cheek and then kind of spread through out the day. It eventually went down to the lower lip on the left side and moved up to the upper lip on the left side. His face was still swollen but to a much less degree. He took Benadryl and it kind of went away and was getting better. His left hand was all swollen and itchy now. It started after but was simultaneous with the face swelling. On 27May2021, he woke up this morning and his right wrist and forearm was swollen. Not really a rash but was red and swollen, and looks like a histamine reaction. Right wrist and forearm swollen was reported as worsened. He had been extremely congested the past 2 days. Was extremely congested with 99 percent blockage. He took Afrin which knocked it out. It was better but he was still very congested. No physician office visited. He was at Urgent Care right now. The outcome of the events &#34;left side of his face swollen and puffy in lips, chin and cheek; extremely congested&#34; was recovering. The outcome of other events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

He says it progressed that evening to numbness and states his spouse noticed slight swelling to his face. He also complained of pain to his teeth and gums. He voiced concerns about bell&#39;s palsy, but stated he didn&#39;t notice any asymmetry or paralysis in his face and his symptoms have resolved entirely as of today 1/4. He was never seen or evaluated while he was having symptoms, unfortunately, and was able to continue working. Denied chest pain or difficulty breathing, no rash. He reports self-medicating with prednisone on sat/sun with improvement and as mentioned, is now asymptomatic.

Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

The pain was very pin point in location and lasted for approximately 10 days before easing up.  Very small isolated pain severe enough to go to the DR, but I could not afford to on account of my wife having severe unknown abdominal pain and being in the ER and DR  multiple times herself (she got the same vaccine an hour before me?).  Possible symptom 2:  4-5 days after the shot I developed an isolated and severe pain in a preexisting nodule/mass (lymph node?) located on my mid right thigh, it has never had any sensation before.  The pain was persistently severe for approximately 7 days before easing up.

January 9  - ER - Diagnosed cellulitis - round of Ceflex for a week - things got worse. Since January 9, I&#39;ve had two other separate ER visits and three rounds of CEFLEX. Was referred to Dermatology - Arrhythmia Nodusem  - so now I&#39;m off Ceflex and on a steroid regimen now. I just started it today. It hurts to even touch my skin and it hurts to walk.I&#39;m in  a lot of pain. I have no open wounds so no reason for this to happen.

                                                Within an hour of receiving the vaccine I felt a sharp pain shoot down the back of my knee to my heal. I continued to work with the pain.  The next day my knee and calf was sizeably larger.  I went to the urgent care on March 19, 2021.  Then to the Emergency room on March 20, 2021.  They performed an ultrasound of my leg and found a blood clot.  It is in a superficial vein.  Followed up with a vein doctor and will go again in three months for another follow up.

I also had and raised reddened (pea to dime sized) hives on my arms, legs and chest.  I thought that it was an allergic reaction to several insect bites from being outdors Sunday evening for about an hour. Allegra and Zyrtec didn&#39;t help the itching very much, so I&#39;ve been taking Allegra every 10 hours and Benadryl every 6 hours for the past 48 hours.  When the Benadryl wears off the hives return become raised, red and very itchy.  I didn&#39;t think that it could be from the vaccine because I didn&#39;t really have any issues other than local swelling and itching at the ilocal area of the vaccine njection site.  I&#39;ve also been treating the hives with topical Hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl cream.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s fiance). A 46-year-old male patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Apr2021 11:20 (Lot Number: EW0162) (received at the age of 46-years-old) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.

She then reported that the patient started experiencing a fever, profuse sweating, and was spacey about 12 hours after the vaccine, a little after midnight 19Apr2021.  She doesn&#39;t know if the dehydration made it worse.  His fever was low-grade 99.8 degrees and lasted 4 and a half to 5 hours and has now resolved.  When asked if patient received any treatment for fever, caller said it was so recent, and that was listed as a common side effect that goes away. Reported the patient drank fluids and she kept an eye on him. Leg swelling was about 15 hours after the vaccine, early morning 19Apr2021.

She further clarified that the patient takes ibuprofen for pre-existing right knee pain. Caller also reported that the patient propped his legs to alleviate the swelling, it has improved some but the swelling did not go away.

A 47-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), unknown on 18Dec2020 (lot number: EK5730) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Caller is a Physician Assistant. Caller states that she is calling about the Covid Vaccine. She had a patient received his first dose of the vaccine on Friday 18Dec2020, 3 days later on 21Dec2020 he had an urticarial rash that persisted, The urticarial rash was treated with prednisone and resolved by 27Dec2020, it has not reoccurred. The allergist said it was a delayed hyper sensitive reaction that was Prompted by the immune simulation from the vaccine. The Patient was treated for the urticaria.  Caller would like to know if a patient experienced an allergic reaction to the first dose is there anything prophylactically needing to be done when administering the second dose of the Covid vaccine? Caller is very upset and frustrated and stating she wants to speak to someone that is a clinician with the clinical trial team who can give her recommendations for a specific patient. Caller asks if they should do Prophylaxis with antihistamines for the second dose. He did not have anaphylaxis but he had angioedema. Caller states that she did a Vaers report on 22Dec2020, but no one contacted her. He started taking Zyrtec and Vistaril. The Allergist said it was fine and he will still need the 2nd Booster Dose. The Angioedema started on 22Dec2020, it was also treated with prednisone, in addition to being administered Benadryl IM, and Vistaril. The outcome of the event urticarial rash was recovered on 27Dec2020 and Angioedema was recovered on 22Dec2020.

                                                47 year old Gynecologist with PMH of severe MDD, GERD, asthma, referred to the ED by his PCP, after 5 days of gait instability, and about 4 weeks of altered mental status, confusion, short term memory deficits and malaise. ADEM suspected and extensive infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic workup was initiated. CT brain  - reported NAD MRI brain consistent with Acute Diffused Encephalomyelitis and suspected ADEM. MRI cervical spine with evidence of demyelination involving posterior cord. ICU course complicated by new onset of aphasia, partial left frontotemporal seizures, LGIB due to proximal rectal laceration and central diabetes insipidus.  Admitted 3/15/21.  On 3/17 he developed aphasia with right sided facial droop and stroke alert was called. Later on 3/17 he developed GI bleeding and was taken for emergent colonoscopy, from which no significant conclusions could be made due to lack of preparation and subsequent poor visualization. No foreign body was reported. After he continued to have ongoing bleeding, the patient had a sigmoidoscopy, during which the migrated clip could be removed and two new hemostatic clips were placed.  He subsequently developed large volume urine output and nephrology was consulted; the patient was diagnosed with likely diabetes insipidus.  On 3/20 acyclovir was discontinued after HSV PCR was negative. High dose solumedrol for ADEM completed 5 day course 3/21.  VDRL was non reactive. There were no oligoclonal bands. Solumedrol 1g daily was started 3/24/21: MRI showed L&gt;R patchy enhancement and diffusion abnormalities consistent with ADEM. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion of the left superior cortex, bilateral medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, genu of the corpus collosum, and pericallosal white matter, with ddx including status epilepticus, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis including herpes simplex.  Completed 5 day course of high dose steroids, 6 days of IVIG and on ongoing PLEX. Neurological improvement noted 3/25

                                                My husband&#39;s face swelled up. The right side of his face around his nose including his lips. It happened suddenly with no warning. He had been feeling ok but that morning experienced sudden onset of severe pain in his hip. He had taken ibuprofen for the pain a few hours before the swelling in his face happened. He has never had any reactions to ibuprofen. He has no known allergies. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before.  The swelling got worse overnight but during the following day the swelling started to go down. By that night it had gone down completely. Now he is fine but his lips look a little bruised, However, now we don&#39;t know if he should get the second vaccination which is scheduled on the 30th April. We did not contact a Dr.

                                                Approximately two weeks after receiving the vaccine I developed Shingles. My symptoms started as a sore/tender area in the center of my right collarbone and a red bump behind and slightly above my right ear that spread until the right side of my neck and head were covered in a thick set of rashes. It took about five days for the rash to fully develop.    I do not have an autoimmune disorder or any  other medical condition that would lower my immunity. I have not been under any undue stress nor am I recovering from a recent illness. I am also not immuno-compromised in any way that I am aware. I had a physical in February with no issues identified. I did have chicken pox as a kid.

The reporter stated that the hospital staff stated that they reported the patient&#39;s adverse event to Pfizer, the local health department and the CDC, but the patient&#39;s family and friends were not sure if the report was filed, thus the reporter was calling. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;6-7 hours after getting home from getting the vaccine on 16Mar2021, the patient started to feel fever, pain in his back, and pain in his neck that went up to his head. The hospital had given the patient Tylenol and the hospital staff informed the patient that if he felt a fever or pain after the COVID-19 vaccine, he should take the Tylenol.

                                                Light headed, dizzy night of shot.  Went to bed.  400 am fever and shivers for 5 hours.  Massive headache.  Lymph nodes and testicles swelled.  All pounded to my heart beat.  Kept taking Tylenol and didn?t seem to matter.  Last for 5-6 hours.  Massive headache continued...tired but hard to sleep sleep and in zombie like state.  Woke up Friday feeling a little better.  Went downhill  about 5pm Friday.  Headache returned.  Tired  and couldn?t sleep much.  Brain in fog.  Went to bed.  Woke up with headache on Saturday.  A wave of fatigue came over Saturday around 3pm.  Tried to nap but couldn?t sleep.  Persistent dry cough developed Saturday night.  Lasted through Sunday.  This is all to the best of my recollection.

The stress does steroids where given through 1/24/21 and medicine for the headaches are still be used to relieve the pain from the headaches. I was released from the hospital the late morning in the late morning of 1/25/21

A 48-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, lot number EH9899, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 06Jan2021 at 09:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received vaccination in Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. Medical history included bladder cancer from an unknown date, cancer treatment with tumor vaccine therapy BCG (Bacillus Calmette Guerin) on 23Dec2020, bone spur in right thumb from an unknown date, COVID-19 from an unknown date and drug allergy to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (AUGMENTIN). The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. Concomitant medication included doxycycline. On 08Jan2021 (also reported 3 days after the vaccine) at 05:45 the patient experienced pain and swelling in his right knee/calf and ankle. Pain and swelling in the right knee, calf and ankle continued until 14Jan2021 when the patient went to the urgent care. He was sent to the emergency room with a suspected blood clot and ultrasound proved no clot was in the leg. On 15Jan2021 the patient went to a hematologist and had an additional ultrasound which found a bakers cyst behind his right knee. He continued to have pain and swelling in the right leg and left hand which had already arthritis and he suspected it was an immune response to the vaccine. Rest, ice, compression and elevation were suggested as therapeutic measures to treat the events. The reported events had not resolved yet at the time of the report.

                                                Directly after the injection there was a tightening of my throat. It did not affect breathing and dissipated over the course of the day. I also had experienced reactive lymphadenopathy, specifically in the left clavicle area. The lymph node protrusion was large enough to been seen with t he naked eye.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes under left armpit were severely inflamed when I woke up on Saturday 2/06/2021. 1-2 days later I had severe pain on my Left back- ended up being my brachial plexus nerve. Few days after that I developed numbness and weakness on my left side and pins and needles in my Left index finger. I saw my primary care doctor twice that week. He started me on low dose Prednisone and gabapentin for the pain while sleeping. When the nerve pain/numbness did not subside, I asked for a neurology referral. Two doctors saw me for brachial plexus neuritis. I have had 2 ultrasound guided and one fluoro guided cortisone shots along the nerve. I have also been going to PT 2-3 x/week to regain my strength on the Left side &amp; calm nerve.

I noticed it in the shower on the morning of Saturday, April 10th, 3 days after my second vaccine dose.  There is no pain. But it did shift on Sunday and the swelling seemed to be both in my armpit and my left breast. But the swelling was reduced.

                                                Fri. Apr. 23, 2021: Within 12 hours of vaccine administration, and in addition to injection site soreness and discomfort, began to notice tenderness above left clavicle, and could feel slight lump or swelling there.  Sat. Apr. 24, 2021:  -7am-8am. Lump on upper surface and tucked behind left clavicle more noticeable and tender, painful if pressed.  Was often irritated and pressed on by seatbelt when driving.   -8pm: Lump above and on clavicle a noticeably swollen, firm mass approximately 2cm across, painful to pressure or touch.  Apparently a swollen lymph node.   Injection site deltoid sore, like ?punch? to arm.  From this point on I will not document that further, other than to say the soreness peaked the following day, and lessened to non-issue rapidly after.  Sun. Apr. 25, 2021: -8am: Swollen lymph node above left clavicle swollen even more, 2-2.5cm across, constantly sore.  Painful when touched or pressed. -12pm: Pain associated with swollen lymph node above left clavicle spread laterally to lateral end of clavicle, and slight swelling to discomfort below lateral end of clavicle, in hollow between pectoral and deltoid muscles.  Remained through night.  Mon. Apr. 26, 2021: -8am: Lymph node over left clavicle still enlarged and tender, painful to touch or pressure, but not quite as bad as previous day. Irritated by seatbelt when driving. -8pm: Lymph node over left clavicle reduced in size to around 1.5cm across, still firm to touch and painful when pressed.    Tue. Apr. 27, 2021: -8am: Lymph node still swollen, about 1-1.5cm across, firm, and painful if pressed.   -8pm: Lymph node approximately 1cm across, but still firm, and painful if pressed.    Wed. Apr. 28, 2021: -8am: Lymph node above left clavicle remains approximately 1cm in size, firm to touch, but not painful, only some tenderness if pressed. -8pm: Same condition as earlier in day.  Thurs. Apr. 29, 2021 through Fri. May 7, 2021:  The lymph node above the left clavicle was pain free.  It stayed the same size, around 1cm, and is still firm enough to feel and locate by touch.  May 7 marked 2 weeks since vaccination dose 1.  Please note, patient was diagnosed as Covid-19 positive on Dec. 27 or 28th, 2020, but had a nearly symptom-free run of the disease (slight and short-lived cough, some joint pain 1 day, no fever, no other symptoms).

I haven&#39;t ever had issues like this before leading me to think the cause may be related to the vaccine.   I&#39;m reporting this in case there is some sort of pattern that others may be reporting.   I say it&#39;s a small chance that it&#39;s related to the vaccine, but I wanted to report it since it was so unusual for me.  In item 21 below I am checking Dr. visit.  Although I have not visited a doctor yet, it looks as if I may have to.

                                                Started experiencing some dizziness on March 8th that lasted for approximately 3 weeks. Did get the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and a week later felt a sort of hot feeling in my head similar to that ballon sensation when first coming down with the flu but nowhere near as intense. The dizziness was worst on March 10th then slowly resolved itself over the next few weeks. It was mild to moderate in intensity, I could feel a continuation of movement after turning my head sideways, it felt like the head was still going. Strange. I was still able to go to work but the effect was noticable. The only variables in my life recently were beginning Humira on Feb 2nd 2021 and getting the series of Pfizer Covid vaccines on Feb 19 and March 12. I did notify my gasteroenterologist because at first I assumed it was the Humira. He said that is not a side effect. On further research I have seen a lot of people reporting vertigo several weeks out after the Covid shots as if the antibody formation produces and inflammatory response in the ear in some patients. Unknown the symptoms are related to the shot or not. I had one outbreak of Meniere&#39;s Disease in 2006 and has not recurred. Perhaps the vaccine can cause a recurrance?

For dose 2, I felt stronger pain at the same place (left armpit) at the night when I took dose 2 shot (4/14/2021). Now 4/16/2021, I am feeling better and predict that it would be gone in days.

He had his first dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer) on 4/23, and his symptoms began on 4/29. He was itchy all over, but when he developed fever and SOB he came to the ER on 5/2 and was discharged on prednisone. His symptoms continued and so he came back to the ER and was admitted. He had a lymph node biopsy to rule out lymphoma (pathology returned negative for lymphoma). He was treated empirically with ceftriaxone and doxycycline. He tested &#43; for EBV IGG but not IGM. EBV PCR was pending upon discharge. He had a borderline positive lyme serology. He was discharged on doxycycline and steroids with improved symptoms. He returned to the ER with again worsening SOB, night sweats, worsening rash, recurrence of fever. He denies sore throat or any sick contacts. He reports a normal appetite. He was found to be hypotensive and in AKI.

An 49-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 11May2021 16:45 (Lot Number: EW0182; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021) as 1st 0.3 ml single dose at the age of 49-years-old for covid-19 immunisation; testosterone cipionate, via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 (Lot Number: 88945; Expiration Date: 30Sep2021) and ongoing, at 150 mg, 2x/week (150 mg injection bi weekly ) for gonads, low testosterone. The patient medical history included low testosterone, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, COVID in the past (He did not know initially he had it, he had lost of taste and smell). Concomitant medication included dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing. None prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history relevant to AEs. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. The patient experienced anaphylactic reaction (medically significant) on 17May2021. Time of onset (24-hour clock): Roughly 18:00. Usually he took the testosterone in the morning, but he forgot. He was wrapping up the day, took the testosterone and by 18:02 he was on the ground, cold. The patient got his vaccination last Tuesday (11May2021). He was also on testosterone for gonadism. He usually administered the vaccine in his shoulders. He took the testosterone bi-weekly. On Monday he administered it his left shoulder and on Thursday it is in his right shoulder. After getting the vaccine he administered testosterone in his right shoulder on Thursday and had no issues. The patient mentioned everyone else who got the COVID Vaccine he knows had sore arm, nausea, but he did not have any of that. On Monday (17May2021) he injected his testosterone into the same arm/location, left arm, where he got the COVID vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction. He contacted his doctor and went to the emergency room. The patient confirmed he felt like he had recovered completely from the anaphylactic reaction. Caller clarified the anaphylactic reaction. He did the testosterone injection in the same spot he had the COVID injection. Within 5 minutes it was like his skin was on fire. He was sweating, had stomach cramps, and was throwing up. Once he stopped throwing up he looked at his arms and saw they were solid red. They were all inflamed. His legs were inflamed. His hands swelled up. They were red. He had to take his wedding ring off. He was itchy. It was like he was on fire. He was sore, and sore where injected the Testosterone into left arm. He confirmed he had no problems swallowing or breathing. Based on the symptoms he was experiencing he realized these were things listed to be aware of when getting the COVID shot and to seek medical attention for. He went to the ER and they verified it was an anaphylactic reaction. Treatment included: He was given an Epi-Pen. It made him feel like off, like he had too much coffee or something. he was also given Benadryl and some Anti-Inflammatory to calm his body down. Investigations: He had blood drawn at the ER. However, he does not know if was actually tested. He was informed when the nurse drew blood it would be up to the doctor, but he has no knowledge if anything was done. Action taken of testosterone cypionate was dose not changed. Outcome of the events was recovered on 17May2021.

A 50-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK4176, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the left arm, on 07Jan2021, at 11:30 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient has no medical history and no known allergies . There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first vaccine of bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020, at 12:00 PM, Intramuscular, on the Right arm for Covid-19 immunization, he had numbness in his right hand x2 days. On 09Jan2021, following second dose, he has had numbness in both hands x2 days and on 10Jan2021, day 2, he ran a fever and his lighter weight facial fillers swelled and were painful (around the eyes - not my lip fillers). His eyes have a mix of Juvaderm products. It spontaneously resolved after 1 day with a subjective loss in overall volume. Density of the product used seemed to be a factor in the response. He knows this has been reported with the Moderna product, but he does not believe is has been reported with our product. It appears the response may not be product specific, but more specific to the type of vaccine. The patient has no Covid prior vaccination and not covid tested post vaccination. No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2020.

                                                Client reports swelling in left armpit, assuming lymph node swelling, on Friday evening (over 48 hours after COVID-19 Vaccine #2 was administered in left deltoid). At time of reporting (2/9/21 at 1100) client reports progression of swelling from left armpit to left side of stomach. Client reports &#34;it looks like [he&#39;s] gained about 15 pounds on the left side of my body&#34; from armpit to stomach. Client reports he is having no pain or discomfort, but feels &#34;a noticeable pressure from fluid buildup on left side of body.&#34; Client went to see internal medicine physician 2/9/21. Physician was not concerned at current state but instructed client to monitor and call physician if pain occurs or if swelling noticeably worsens. When asked if swelling was worsening each day, client states it is hard to tell due to the shifting of fluid and &#34;maybe settling due to gravity.&#34;

I had Covid in March 2020 and the feeling was similar without the coughing and much shorter timeframe.  That continued until about 3am on Thursday March 18 when I thought I was almost back to normal.   When I woke up at 6am I thought I was ok but then I realized I had a lump under my left armpit on my side seemingly like my lymph node is swollen.  That continues as I write this at 341pm on Friday March 19.  I also developed hives on my right bicep and on my left and right buttocks and left and right hamstrings.  this is itchy.  I no longer have the soreness, sweating or fatigue but i have the swollen and what seems to be allergic reaction symptoms of hives.

                                                No immediate reaction but 5 days later (April 1) lymph nodes on neck were painful but went away after a day. But nausea and loss of appetite which started 5 days later on April 1 still remain as of today 4/7.  It doesn&#39;t prevent me from eating or any other problems just definitely not myself.     What&#39;s even more strange is my desire to drink 7up because of feeling sick. Haven&#39;t drank this stuff in over 30 years. But the feeling of nausea triggered past memoires of drinking 7up to feel better.

Injection site pain - feels like been punched in arm. Headache in the evening. Night chills and complained of &#34;tight&#34; (not acute) chest pain... but no breathing problems. Morning fever of 101F. Headache, Dizzy, Fatigue, Muscle Pain (esp in legs, asif he had &#34;run a marathon&#34;). He spent most of the day &#34;resting&#34;.  Evening on day two, we noticed a large bump under his vaccinated arm. Radius about 5cm - larger than what I know swollen lymph nodes to look like - almost looks like a bicep between his armpit and nipple. Tender to touch. Morning of day three (48 hours after vaccine) bump under his arm remains and all other symptoms seem milder.

Helped at first but now pain and swelling have persisted. Did go jogging while on vacation and thought this may have attributed, now more concerned about DVT.

About 14 days later I started to get a rash on hands and feet with burning sensation.  I was evaluated and diagnosed with Covid toes.  About 1 week later I developed a fever and was evaluated and diagnosed with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and a DVT.  I continue to get worse to include arthritis in hands, wrists, feet and ankles.  I was admitted to the hospital with worsening pneumonia, reactive arthritis and a rash on elbows, knees, hands and feet.  I was in the hospital for about 5 days.  I have been evaluated by rheumatology, pulmonary and dermatology since.  The ongoing theory is I have a reactive arthritis from COVID and may have developed psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis.

A 50-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 50-year-old, dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 25Mar2021 19:00 (Lot Number: ER8730; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to spring pollen, oak birch, and ash. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) and levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) taken as allergy medication. On 25Mar2021, the patient got the shot, waited 15 minutes, no problems. On 26Mar2021, woke up to a very very red face. On 27Mar2021, massive facial angioedema, fatigue, itching, notable penis redness, his penis was also &#34;sheet red&#34; and swollen. The patient started 4mg prednisolone on 27Mar2021, kept facial swelling and allergies at bay, mostly, but a very close rate to not keeping up. On 02Apr2021, swelling subsided and mostly was getting back to &#34;normal&#34;, however lips were flaking, skin flaking. On 04Apr2021-week of, things got better, very swollen lips but everything reasonably in check. On 12Apr2021, the face re-firing red at approx 1pm, slept until 6pm, and complete relapse of allergy/angioedema. Trip to Emergency room (ER), given shot of Kenelog in the arm, released. On 13Apr2021, no improvement, steroids ended 6 days after the patient started taking them, 2nd trip to ER with epinephrine shot, no improvement; blood taken, white blood cell count normal. On 14Apr2021, allergist appointment and he was told that he was allergic to something in the shot triggers pollen allergies, rosacea, etc. 50mg prednisone 5 days, 40mg 5 days, etc. He states that it was a systemic histamine reaction. On 26Apr2021 starts up again, mild, contact me. The patient doesn&#39;t know what to do with the second vaccine in general and he had called and they say no on him getting number 2. He was terrified of vaccines now because of his reaction. He also says that he was not hospitalized but he went to the emergency room twice. The patient would like to know if there have been any reports of those who had a similar reaction to this getting the second dose of the vaccine and how they reacted. He states that he has been told that he should not get the second dose but wonders if he were to get another COVID-19 vaccine other than Pfizer, if he would have the same reaction. The event allergic to something in the shot/systemic histamine reaction resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The event massive facial angioedema/ complete relapse of allergy/angioedema resulted to emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with steroids for the events. The outcome of the event massive facial angioedema/complete relapse of allergy/angioedema was not recovered while for the rest of the events was recovering.

                                                Shortly after receiving the injection my arm went ice cold all the way to my fingers and warmed up again quickly. On the way home (about an hour later) I noticed numbness and tingling in my hand and that has continued since (11 days as of this report). My upper arm muscle was sore later that evening and by the next day the pain in my upper arm was extreme. I couldn&#39;t move my arm without extreme pain. I took some tylenol late in the day and that did help cut down on some of the pain. I also put an ice pack on my upper arm but it didn&#39;t help. The pain wasn&#39;t as bad the next (3rd) day but it&#39;s still significant enough for me to restrict activity with it. There is also a burning sensation off and on as well as itching deep in my arm. My upper arm has also felt like there is a tight band around it (since day 2) although the muscles themselves don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s any tightness or knots. I took ibuprofen on day 10 and it helped a little but not a whole lot. At this point I also have what feels like swelling or tenderness under my arm near the armpit area. The pain, burning and itching in my upper arm continues as well as the numbness, tingling and pins all up and down my arm to my hand and fingers.

                                                Within 24 hours I developed chest pain about 2 inches to left of sternum. Within another 24 hours the pain shifted another 2 inches towards my left armpit. Pain can be slight to intense at times requiring me to sit down.  Within 24 hours I developed a painful bump in the trapezoid about halfway between neck and shoulder.  The bump has gone down now (day 10) but the pain continues. It?s relatively constant throughout the day but gets severe enough towards the evening to stop or minimize the use of my left arm. It seems to be activity related. The more I need to do that day, the worse it is in the evening. Pain in left arm has been as expected but continues at day 10. It is slowly subsiding and is minimal compared to the other two pain locations.

Also noticed the day after both shots I was highly sensitive to the sun  and my forehead got discolored blotchy red/brown (similar to a bad sunburn but without the pain) that took a day to mostly go away, but still has hints of it.   Cold sore is subsiding but expect it to last at least a week. Haven?t had them in a long time, but recognize it.

CONSULTS: None    INPATIENT PROCEDURES: None    DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY: Patient is a 51 y.o. male with a past medical history of psoriasis, environmental allergies who presents today with sudden shortness of breath, left side pleuritic chest pain 7/10, worsened with deep inspiration.  No recent travel, no family history, no history of malignancies, no immobilization or surgeries. He had his 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on April 1.  He does not have a history of COVID-19 infection, and COVID-19 PCR test was negative in ER. His blood pressure is a little high at 170 6/83 mm, pulse 76 per minute saturating 96% on room air, troponin less than 6, BNP 16, WBC 12.3,, EKG without any significant ST T-wave changes. CT angiogram of the chest shows nonocclusive thrombi in almost all the lobes, there is no saddle embolus noted.  There is no evidence of right heart strain.  Echo: The technical quality of the exam was limited due to suboptimal acoustic windows. The left ventricle is normal in size. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness. The left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. Regional wall motion abnormalities cannot be excluded due to limited visualization. The right ventricular size, thickness, and function are normal. No significant valvular pathology identified with Doppler examination. There was insufficient tricuspid regurgitation envelope detected to calculate right ventricular systolic pressure.  Injection of contrast documented no interatrial shunt. There is no comparison study available.  He was started on Heparin gtt. And admitted for observation. He required no supplemental oxygen. He was discharged later pm on Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, than 5 mg bid for 3 months. I am questioning did he had COVID-19 vaccine related bilateral PE. His hypercoagulable profile is pending. He has no sign of malignancy, no new symptoms, no weight loss. He had normal colonoscopy 2 yrs ago.  He should follow up with his PCP.  He was given work excuse from 4/26-5/3/21. She shouldn&#39;t take non steroidal anti-inflammatory (Ibuprofen (Motrin), Naproxen, Naprosyn, Voltaren, Relafen ... meds because of blood thinner Eliquis. He can take Tylenol 500 mg 1-2 tabs 3-4x a day as needed. He was also prescribed Lidoderm patch.    For HTN he was started on DASH diet and Norvasc 5 mg daily. He should follow up with PCP next week.  Also he was instructed to quit smoking.

They tried to give me muscle relaxants and pain meds. But It did not cure anything. I have had a low-grade temperature(usually exactly 99.5 but sometimes higher ) for 38 days and does not go away. I felt inflammation and at the hospital, they did a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and it showed 144 mg/L. I entered the hospital from 5/21/2021 till 5/25/2021. They ran many tests but found no infections. They did possibly find some preexisting condition that I might have had all along.  The only problem I have is I was completely healthy per se (even with the preexisting condition that I didn?t know about) right before the vaccine I was able to exercise, able to lift weights, good energy level, and eating properly. I feel like the vaccine is still somehow working in my body even that is not supposed to be the case. I feel like my body is still in a state of hyper inflammation and it killing me.

A 52-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0164), at the age of 51 years old, in right arm at single dose on 23Apr2021 16:30 for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, seasonal allergy and covid-19 in May2020. The patient reported he had symptoms of the covid-19 virus in May2020. He had a positive covid-19 virus test and did quarantine. The patient reported he&#39;s never been allergic to any kind of medication. Concomitant medications included atenolol 50-25 mg at one tablet a day. The patient didn&#39;t know the name of the other medication combined with the atenolol. The patient reported one was for the heart and one was for the blood. He also took medication for seasonal allergies but declined to provide the name. The patient previously received a flu vaccine (NDC/Lot/Expiry: unknown) on 2020 that made him feel bad with a head cold. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EP7534), at the age of 51 years old, in right arm at single dose on 02Apr2021 16:30 for covid-19 immunization. The patient started having some problems maybe a week after that. He started feeling like the nerves in his right arm were jumping. Like his right arm was agitated. His finger on his right hand were swollen. The patient did get his vaccine in the right arm. He thought his arm was going to bother him after he got the vaccine. The nerves in his right wrist are bothering him. Like he felt the nerves moving up and down and his arms, like he had no control of his arm. His right hand blew up with inflammation. His right hand looked like it was going to explode. His right hand won&#39;t relax. On 01May2021 was when he noticed his arm acting funny. He would say that the swelling had gone down from taking the antibiotics but his right arm was still very uncomfortable and he couldn&#39;t bend the fingers on his right hand and he couldn&#39;t make a fist with his right hand. His right wrist felt like needle and pins. The patient went to the emergency room at a hospital two nights in a row on 04May2021 and 05May2021. The first time he had x-rays done. The second time he had x-rays and a sonogram of his right arm to check for blood clots and he had some blood work done. All of that came back negative. The emergency room doctor asked him what arm did receive BNT162B2 in, he told the doctor his right arm, the doctor told him he&#39;s having an allergic reaction to BNT162B2. The emergency room doctor prescribed him an antibiotic to take. He&#39;d already finished the antibiotic and didn&#39;t recall the name, the bottle had been thrown away. The patient followed up with his primary care doctor on 13May2021 and was given a prescription for a muscle relaxer and motrin 600 mg to help bring the swelling and pain down in his hand. In the emergency department he had a right arm and right wrist x-ray. The doctor was trying to figure out why his right hand looked like a balloon. The only conclusion the emergency room doctor came up with was that he was having a reaction to BNT162B2. The outcome of events nerve in wrist bothering, felt nerve moving, feeling nerves jumping, right arm agitated, no control of arm, right hand won&#39;t relax and couldn&#39;t bend fingers was not recovered. The outcome of events hand blew up with inflammation, fingers on right hand swollen, right hand explode and pain in hand was recovering. The outcome of events wrist felt like needles and pins and allergic reaction to vaccine was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 51-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 04May2021 (at age of 51 years old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included flu, has gotten the flu before but has never gone on this long.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Clinical course as reported: He is a practicing physician who has been providing vaccinations to patients all of his life.  He ended up with severe right deltoid pain. It is usually not a problem, he has dealt with this with other shots.  By the second or third day, it was very tender and swollen and had axillary lymphadenopathy on the same side he re-ceived the vaccination. It persisted the next day until day 5 or 6. He then started to get worried.  He went to the hospital. They did a CT scan which noted there was notable lymphadenopathy. They thought it was a reaction to the Covid vaccination.  2 days later, he went home and he kept taking Motrin and Tylenol on board. Lymphadenopathy was evident in the left axilla, inguinal nodes, and is still there now. On day 7, he went into full blown flu syndrome, had a headache, body aches and flu like chills, the whole thing. Is still a little bit rhinitic and is very congested, and is draining like a faucet. It has all been happening since he got vaccinated. He was told he was either exposed to covid or it is from the vaccination. He went to urgent care yesterday (20May2021) and they did a Covid test which was negative.  He hates to point fingers but this fatigue has been overwhelming and is never ending.  He called withheld where he got the vaccination. He said the pharmacist has been hearing this from a lot of patients.  He reported for 7 days straight the clinical events as they were happening. Nobody has contacted him, they said some-one would be contacting him the next day and he has not heard from anyone.  This laid him up for 5 days. The last 4 days, he had severe pain in the left foot, and the right hand. It was out of the blue like someone whacked him with a hammer. He couldn&#39;t even walk, it was completely painful.  He hasn&#39;t worked out since he got the damn shot. In 15 days, he has not gone to the gym.  They did an X-ray which didn&#39;t say anything. He was in immense pain. They gave him prescription for Prednisone 50mg and he hasn&#39;t been able to get to the pharmacy to get it yet but will head over shortly.  Has been taking Motrin and Tylenol around the clock. Has been taking antihistamines because his nose has been running like a faucet non stop and he has a sore throat. Sore throat has gotten better in the last 5 days. The pain was really bad. The sore throat has subsided. The  nasal drain-age and his eyes are watery are still there. Has been fatigued and his body aches and he is exhausted.  The second vaccination is due 25May2021 and he is absolutely not getting the second one.  When having other viral syndromes, he has never felt this sick. Has gotten the flu before but has never gone on this long.  He is just feeling like crap. Can barely even get out of bed every morning. It is unbelievable. He hasn&#39;t had any true positive exposure. Has not been exposed to other family members with Covid/ coronavirus.  Have practices strict isolation in their home. They have 5 kids and they did not go near anyone or go to any public places.  For this to happen, it has to be because of the vaccine. Nothing else could have caused this. No one else around him has been sick. Is not sure if they are getting a lot of reports.  When going on line to the Pfizer vaccine reporting, it took him a while to get a number to contact Pfizer directly. He called (Withheld) and they gave him 2 wrong numbers. It took 4 people to get the number to report this to Pfizer. He thinks there is a lot of under reporting.  If he has a deductible, he would like Pfizer to take care of the cost for his ER visit. On 21May2021,  reported that Beginning 05/04 when received vaccine, experienced Very large lymph nodes and Flu syndrome. Outcome for events sore throat was recovered on May2021, for other events was unknown.

A 51-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot/Batch number: EW0181), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 28May2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included alcohol use stated that all he does was drink some liquor and beer. No medications or surgeries. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. Patient stated that after he received his first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine dose on 28May2021, later that day he states his left arm (injection arm) started twitching, he vomited, and his left pinky and ring fingers were numb, and the patient felt nervous like he was shaking. On 14Jun2021, the patient also stated that he got the shot and the band aid that they cover the injection area with, it was branded in his arm and he got the shot 3 weeks ago and it looks like a band aid is on his arm. He thought it would be gone and it stayed. On an unknown date, the patient reported that his right leg and foot started swelling. The patient&#39;s right leg blew up. He reports the band aid to his injection site looks like it &#34;burned&#34; into his arm. He states his right/foot leg swelling and left arm twitching have continued and wants to know if this is a reported side effect. Now after he got the shot his arm has been twitching, he&#39;s sweating and vomiting all morning. His right leg blew up and he feels weird. He just doesn&#39;t feel like himself. Right after the shot, the patient felt like there&#39;s a bunch of fluid. It&#39;s ongoing, it has gone down a little bit. It&#39;s improved a little, very irritating when it does happen. He can&#39;t eat. It won&#39;t stay in his stomach and he can&#39;t hold water. It has improved but when it happens, he feels terrible. There was no emergency or physician room visit for the events. The clinical outcome for the events was unknown, the other events muscle twitching, and shaking was not recovered.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

The flu symptoms passed, but continued to have problems with lymph nodes. Fatigue set in just after flu symptoms, have never recovered. In June, I started having pain in my upper maxillary. Saw my dentist, who sent me to a dental surgeon. They determined that it was wire from a jaw surgery 30 years ago. They removed the wire, but all of the other wires are giving me pain, and may need to be removed. They had not bothered me prior to the vaccine. Mental health has also declined and not recovered. My medications are now higher than pre vaccine. Fatigue is still a major problem.

Patient has had HSV-1 lesions before but never to this extent; patient is otherwise stable and afebrile.  He has no radicular pain. Labs are ordered for CBC and a CMP. The vaccine support center was called at approximately 3:35 PM and message left.  The vaccine support center was called again on February 26, 2021 at approximately 9:20 AM. Provider spoke with NP for consultation. VAERS CDC report advised. No further action required. Antiviral medication was not offered due to the fact that patient was on day 6 post outbreak and out of the window of opportunity to treat acutely.

A 52-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6205, Expiry date: Jun2021), via intramuscularly to the left arm on 26Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included Hypertriglyceridaemia ongoing. Concomitant medication included Fenofibrate. The patient previous vaccination included Shingrix used for shingles and experienced with sore arm. The patient lab test included Sar-cov-2 which was negative. Patient reported that he received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech covid vaccine on 26Feb2021. He is due for his second dose this Friday 19Mar2021. He is calling because he experienced lymphadenopathy- explains he experienced Lymph node pain/tenderness around his left clavicle. Caller clarified that the injection was on his left side. The pain/tenderness occurred the next day, 27Feb2021 and it was self limiting and it lasted about 5-7 days. He didn&#39;t think anything of it, everything else was ok, the arm pain resolved after one day. On 12Mar2021, he developed similar pain on the right side, but it was a more intense pain/tenderness and lasted maybe 4 days. He still experiences it, but less frequently. He is not sure if he is describing it correctly. During the afternoon, it gets a bit more tender. He doesn&#39;t feel it in the morning, but by the afternoon he notices the pain/tenderness. He did not know if there were any reports of contralateral lymphadenopathy (lymph node pain). He clarified that there is no redness or lump- he doesn&#39;t feel anything, even if he touches it there&#39;s no pain, but periodically there will be a shooting tenderness. He feels like it&#39;s getting better, but it is still persisting. He clarified that on the right side- he is experiencing pain near the axilla, underneath the arm next to the chest. He is waiting to see if it is improving and doesn&#39;t know how long he should wait. He stated that it wasn&#39;t that painful on the left side, it was just a little tender; he knew something was different. The pain wasn&#39;t always there. Sometimes there&#39;s a little pain on the left side still, but not as intense as the right side. The pain is there, it&#39;s not worsening but it is not improving. The patient also reports joint stiffness around neck and shoulder and describes discomfort as ongoing intermittent tenderness. The reporter reported events Lymphadenopathy-Lymph node pain around left clavicle, Lymphadenopathy-Lymph Node Pain/tenderness on right side- near the axilla, underneath the arm next to the chest to be serious due to Medically significant. The outcome of events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts needed.

                                                Side effects: light chills, strong headache (3 days, after now 9 days still coming back briefly), fever (37.8C), muscle pain, body joint pain for 3 days, left arm pain (3 days), sweating (2nd night), fatigue for ~2days, and most importantly: for over 9 days/nights swollen nymph knot under left arm, was as big as a full hand full (like a full bar of soap), has meanwhile improved daily, but I can still sense a small (wallnut size) under the arm now, 9 days after the shot. It&#39;s important to inform because the media and the doctors are not reporting how bad and lasting the side effects are and it is important to be transparent to patients what to expect, otherwise trust is eroded and people stop getting vaccinated.

The next morning, 4/23, my lymph nodes on the side of my neck, and under the tip of my chin swelled up  significantly. Still there... Then the headache started (4/23), and is still ongoing. This is accompanied with major body aches, a very low grade fever, and occasional chills. Today, 4/27 at approximately 6:30pm, I started puking.

A 52-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0173 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 08May2021 at 02:38 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included Bug bite (happened 5 days prior to 30Apr2021 and regimen of an antibiotic). He was completely done with the rotation for a least 8 days before he got the vaccine. It might have something to do with this. concomitant medication included dicloxacillin (started it on 30Apr2021 and it was for 5 days. He did not know what it did was). The patient reported that on 08May2021, day one, he experienced, tiredness and injection site pain. On day 2, until now side effects which had not gone away. It hadn&#39;t gotten worse, but it was not any better. The patient felt like congestion, but his nose was bone dry, like crusty dry. It hurts a little bit because it was so dry and he had arm soreness, nothing out of the ordinary. The arm soreness was just normal injection stuff. At first it was a little tender on the injection spot. It went away after about a day. On 10May2021, the patient felt like there were little, tiny baby hands pinching his internal organs randomly throughout his abdomen. It was not a sharp pain, more like a little squeeze all through his abdomen. It felt like his whole throat was swollen. It was not visually swollen, it more felt like a football in his neck. Stretching it was helping. His toes have been locking up like a pre-clamping. He had numbness from his ankles to his feet for 8 days, and now he has numbness from his knees to his feet. It was not completely numb, but it was not normal. The feeling of baby hands pinching his internal organs started the second day after the vaccine and has stayed consistent. The patient&#39;s eyes swollen, and his vision was diminished. Day 2 through today, it felt like his eyes were swollen, his vision was seriously diminished, he had a golf ball sized welt on his arm not at the injection site but 2 inches from it, and he was really dizzy and really lightheaded and almost fainted at the corner store. The feeling like his eyes were swollen started on day 3 after the vaccine. The crease of his eye be-low the eyebrow and on top of the socket got red and puffy and looked like sunburnt skin does. It was at the point that now it feels swollen all the time almost like he had pink eye and his vision has been diminished about 30%. He had a test done yesterday and his vision was 20/25. Some-times he could not even read a text and had to stare at his phone for 10 minutes to make out words. He did not have these issues before. The feeling of his eyes being swollen was a little better in the mornings and about 1300 it gets worse when he gets lightheaded to where was when it started. His vision became diminished about day 3 after the vaccine. It was a little better in the morning, but in the afternoon, it goes to exactly the same as when it started. He noticed the golf ball sized welt on his arm about 3 days ago. The doctor seemed to think a drop of the injection might had travelled from the injection site and his body was creating a defense to it. It was scary to take a shower and then see that. It didn&#39;t hurt. It was not painful, but it was a weird foreign entity. The cramping in his toes started probably day 3 and was consistent. The numbness started on day 2 after the vaccine, and up until 3 days ago it was just his ankles and feet. 3 days ago, it got to the point where it was from his knees to his feet. It has gotten worse since it was now travelling up his legs. On his injection arm- 2 inches away from the injection site appeared a size of a gigantic golf ball - when asked with his doctor he said that he thinks that a drop of the vaccine travelled and his body building a reaction to it and it was very abnormal. The patient also had numbness from his ankle to his feet worsened and from his knees to his feet- almost feels like it was cold and tingly. The patient also had dizziness and lightheaded about day 2 after the vaccine and it was the same. It came in waves but was consistent throughout the day. He would be fine then had a wave of dizziness. He has been laying down so much because he was so tired, ringing ears, felt like his glands were swollen, pressure in his neck to his injection site, and back pains. The patient stated that his doctor was only form urgent care. The patient Felt like whole throat was swollen, toes locking up, really lightheaded, mind has been foggy, and arm soreness. The patient had bizarre side effects from the Covid Vaccine for 11 days now. He thought it was the smart thing to report them to Pfizer. He didn&#39;t like to give personal information. He declined to give his mailing address or his email address. He hated when asked for race, but he guessed it might be important. He did not have a mailing address, phone number, or email address handy for his physician. He went to Urgent Care yesterday to have it checked and they did an EKG and said he had to be sent by ambulance to the ER. The doctor did bloodwork, and she said everything looked alright and to rest a few more days and keep hydrated. The patient underwent the lab work and procedures which included chest X-ray with unspecified result. He thinks it was on 18May2021. His mind has been foggy with all of that. It was yesterday or the day before. He could not be sure. He has been sleeping so much and was in a complete daze. The fogginess he had the whole time as his other symptoms, and it was the same. He has been eating well and hydrating and taking a multivitamin and Gatorade, all the things&#39; people say to do. He asked if Pfizer has heard of this before. He was panicked it might be chronic, and he worries about the safety of the second shot for him. He was sure many people haven&#39;t reacted, but these are freaky side effects. He asked for advice and if Pfizer had heard of this before or if he was some weird anomaly. On his way to get the vaccine he asked 2 people at the city health line if they had taken it and they both said no. He asked 3 other patients and they said they took the Pfizer. One woman said she will take it when they make her. The guy who gave him the shot lied and said he wasn&#39;t eligible. It might have been his way of not having to discuss it. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior vaccination. The patient was tested for Covid post vaccination with Nasal Swab on 18May2021. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Device Date: 23May2021,Additional information has been requested.

One vial of two was diluted incorrectly with less Normal Saline than require. This error was not noticed until person mixing vaccine said they were out of vaccine and did not have enough to get 5 dosages of 0.3ml. Two people mixed one vial of vaccine together demonstrating to the other. It appears the person making the error did not notice they did not have 1.8ml of NS but must have had some air and did not realize it. The error was noticed when all the vaccines were given and one person had not completed pulling up the vaccine. So, 2 of 7 patients received the incorrect dose of vaccine and it could not be determined which two received the incorrect dose. Patient report; slightly sore arm, some slight body aches---resolved

                                                It appears that I obtained gout as a result of the vaccination I received on May 2nd, 2021. I have no prior history of gout. Several hours after my vaccination my big toe on my left foot began to hurt. By Monday morning, May 3rd 2021, my big toe and the area surrounding it had swollen and was very painful, making it difficult to walk. I began putting my foot in cold water as well as hot water with epsom salt.to reduce the swelling and get rid of the pain. On Tuesday morning, May 4th, 2021, my toe felt better was still painful to walk and put pressure on it. There is still swelling on my foot in the area around my big toe as well. In googling my issue and feeling that this could only be due to receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, I decided to contact a podiatrist. I scheduled an appointment to see Dr.  on Thursday, May 6th 2021 @ 11:30 a.m.

Given an IV of antihistamines, steroids, and something else. Given a CAT scan to ensure swelling was subsiding. Within 10 minutes after the second shot, my neck had a bulge the size of a softball.  This was day one.  As I type this message, it is now 22 days since that injection and I still have large swelling of my left lymph nodes on my neck and around my left shoulder blade causing me pain.

I felt faint about 30 minutes after the first dose as well.   The second dose seemed to be going okay even though there was much more pain at the injection site.  But the armpit and lymph node issue has become much worse after the second dose.  Painful to touch today into the left pectoral region the sometimes travels into the rib cage.  Soreness in the left elbow and left index finger.   All of this has been occurring since April 29th and it is still happening May 20th.

                                                Patient is noticed to have generalized weakness, holding his head towards right side, mild right facial puffiness with mild left facial droop, and sent to ER, on 1/22/21. Patient also had mild fever for the last two days and was on Tylenol, blood pressure also remained elevated moderately than the usual readings. Patient was admitted through ER for 2 days and was discharged on 1/24/21, with a diagnosis of possible TIA, Todd&#39;s paresis post seizure. Patient&#39;s CT head and MRI of brain was negative for acute stroke. Patient&#39;s left facial droop and right side facial puffiness resolved over a week but noticed to have right sided pronounced weakness with moderate swelling on right arm. Patient used to eat by himself,but now not able to do so and not able to hold cup in the right hand. Patient was again sent to ER for repeat CAT scan of head, further evaluation and management. Not sure if patient had an adverse reaction to Covid-19 vaccination, but definitely these symptoms were developed after 2 weeks of receiving Pfizer vaccination, which may be coincidental. Patient was followed up by the neurologist a week after the discharge from hospital who couldn&#39;t rule out adverse reaction of vaccination. Patient is awaiting for an EEG, carotid ultrasound and Echo as an out patient.

Shortly thereafter, I developed a sever headache along with fever, chills and lethargy. Sever body aches followed with joint pain throughout entire body. All symptoms lasted 24-36 hours. 48 hours later, still feeling stiff with aching back muscles and feeling tired.  Large underarm lumps have developed 72 hours after injection. All of the aforementioned occurred after the second injection.

A week later I started to feel very ill; chills, low grade fever, fatigue, sweaty, head ache in the middle of my face, muscle aches, fuzzy thinking, and later a cold sore. I started taking Tylenol and stayed home from work. It has persisted over the past 4 days but I started to feel better yesterday.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

Patient was hospitalized for management of severe sepsis secondary to Covid pneumonia resulting in acute hypoxic respiratory failure.  Patient was also treated for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia given duration of Covid symptoms prior to coming into hospital.  Patient made nice recovery and was able to wean off from high flow oxygen down to 2 L with exertion.  Patient overall made nice recovery hence he was discharged home.   Patient was noted to have rising D-dimers despite clinical improvement in Covid infection.  He is at high risk for developing DVTs hence he was recommended to use Xarelto 10 mg daily for 1 month to prevent any risk of DVTs.   Patient voiced understanding of this.  In he was discharged home with home health care.   His readmission potential is low to moderate.

                                                The first night I had itching down my left arm and palm of my hands, my wrist. Then my hands swelled up quite large. It lasted about 3-4 hours and then completely went away. The following day, the same thing happened but this time it was both hands around midday. I had some pain, but it was not severe. This lasted 3-4 hours again and went away. The next day, both my armpits swelled up profusely and itched. I had light itching on both arms and swelling again. On my back, the pain shot down my back and in my left hip. The pain was not extreme, it was just uncomfortable. This lasted a few hours and went away as usual. About 24 hours and nothing happened. Then my left hand and palm started itching lightly. My tongue and mouth began itching and swelling profusely to a point where i couldn&#39;t eat anything. The next day, my heels started itching on both feet and my toes swelled up. I saw my doctor who provided me steroids. They lasted 5 days and I had no symptoms while on the steroids. When the steroids ended, my throat started to swell and my mouth as well. It got a little difficult to breathe but by the time I got ready to go to the ER it had subsided. This was accompanied by lite swelling and itching in my left hand. The same symptoms keep occurring. I went to an allergist/immunization specialist. I am now on my 3rd run of steroids. As soon I am off the steroids, my symptoms return. I have also been on antihistamines which seemed to help a little in conjunction with the steroids. Without the steroids, they do not help.

A 55-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), intramuscular in left arm on 17Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included mixed hyperlipidemia. The patient had no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on Jan2021 via intramuscular. On 17Jan2021, the patient experienced nasal and sinus congestion, rash on chest and face, angioedema of lips and periorbital area and wheezing. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient received an OTC antihistamine and monitored the condition.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a chronological association and known product safety profile, a causal relationship between event angioedema and BNT162B2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient at appointed time for second dose and related this event. Patient reported that the vaccine site became progressively painful, swollen and bruised starting the day after the vaccination.  The swelling progressed including his hand, numbness in the ulnar nerve area. By 3-4 days after vaccination he was unable to lift his shoulder so  he saw his PCP who suspected a hematoma or thrombus but found neither. He then saw an orthopedist Feb 3 or 4 who was uncertain but sent him to Physical Therapy with a diagnosis of axillary nerve  injury.    See continuation page

No ear pain, sore throat, fever, or other evidence of URI. Has happened once before in entire life, and that was with fever and sore throat.  After 16 hours of swelling and mild aching from swollen nodes, consumed Naprosyn 250mg 12 hours apart. 2 doses total. awoke the next morning with isolated, painless, 2 cm bullae on left abdomen, 3 cm bullae on left forearm, 1 cm reddened patch adjacent to arm bullae (suspected this area to also develop bullae). Discontinued Naprosyn. Abdominal bullae spontaneously drained. Reddened patch disappeared. 3 cm bullae persists but no growth or change. No new lesions, though right preauricular adenopathy slightly increased in swelling and tenderness.

In hindsight, he is questioning whether there is an association between his COVID vaccine series and the clot. He recieved his 1st dose (reported above) on 3/13/21. Symptoms (gradually progressive redness, irritation, swelling) began approximately 3/28/21, but were not recognized as a blood clot at the time. He received his second dose on 4/3/21 (Lot EW0150) in the right deltoid muscle. He reported to the ED for treatment on 4/4/21 with continued worsening of symptoms. So far, his treatment is going well with no lasting deficits and continuing followup treatment.

                                                anaphylaxis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified),  via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 05Dec2020 11:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; and amoxicillin, clavulanic acid (AUGMENTIN), via an unspecified route of administration from 18Mar2021 at unspecified dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), AV Nodal block, and pacemaker. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 18Mar2021 20:00, the patient experienced anaphylaxis. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days on an unspecified date due to the event. The patient reported that he was on augmentin on and off for years and when he got his first vaccine. And on 18Mar2021, he began augmentin again and had anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization. The patient was asking if this was related to the vaccine, but seems to be a possibility. The event resulted in resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The event was treated with epinephrine, steroids, benadryl, and fluids. There was no other vaccine in 4 weeks and patient had not had Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The action taken in response to the event for amoxicillin, clavulanic acid was unknown. Outcome of event was recovered in 2021.  Information on batch/lot number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the event anaphylaxis is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2. The event occurred more than 3 months after the administration of vaccine and can be attributed to augmentin based on provided information, including close temporal relationship and positive rechallenge.

A 55-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP6955; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 24Mar2021 (at the age of 55years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heterotaxia (Situs inversus), ankylosing spondylitis, back problem, and cerebral palsy; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included diazepam, methocarbamol, meloxicam, salbutamol (ALBUTEROL), and unspecified muscle relaxant; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient reported side effects that has official after taking the COVID shot (confirmed as Pfizer COVID Vaccine). The patient stated &#34;I&#39;ve got cerebral palsy in my left hand and it seems to be a better connection in my left hand, I can now, it&#39;s easier for me to pick up small objects and I used to have problems doing that. It is like, I am messenger pain is eating my nerve endings. But here&#39;s what happened, 2 days after taking the shot around 26th, I took the shot on 24thMarch, 2021; I took Diazepam, Meloxicam and muscle relaxer (captured as unspecified medication) for back problem. I don&#39;t even know if it had anything to do with it, might be just been all the shot, but methocarbamol too. I took those 3 drugs, 2 hours after that, my whole hand, my whole left hand, just my left hand started hurting (further clarification unknown hence captured as suspect conservatively). In my left-hand kind of after feeling and I couldn&#39;t move my fingers as well. And afterwards it was in March, it started hurting, my whole hand swelled a little bit. It had like a slight fever to it, it was warm, and it swelled up just slightly not up here, nothing big. I still can&#39;t put in my ring, but it was slightly bigger than what it is today, and this hurt. It felt like, I&#39;ve chills my whole hand like it&#39;s going down. So, I work it out, I stretched it, that helped the pain so I could work with them during my fingers stopped working it out. And then afterwards I found out I could, my hands were moving better, it works better. Before I&#39;ve like little jerks in my hands, you know my hand wouldn&#39;t do what I wanted it to do. What I wanted to do more, I can press button, I can pick up smaller objects. It&#39;s not 100 percent better, it&#39;s not as good as my right hand which had no cerebral palsy in it but it&#39;s a lot better than it was. So, I just wanted to report that.&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Development of fever blisters (cold sores).   I&#39;ve had cold sore/fever blister before.  For the past 30 years I would typically get ONE cold sore roughly about every 3-4 years.  Typically it was an indicator I was about to experience an illness.  They were VERY rare and always noted as I will not kiss my children or wife when I would get one.  It would always appear in the exact same location on the upper left part of my top lip.  Very minor cold sore but a cold sore none the less.  My reaction to the 2nd shot was pretty strong.  I had a 102F fever starting at 10PM the evening after the second vaccination.  Very strong muscle contractions and joint inflammation.  The fever and soreness disappeared about 36 hours later and I was fine.  Fast forward a week or two (from the second shot) and I developed an unusual coldsore on my lower lip.  It appeared almost immediately.  I began to apply Abrevia (10% Docosanol) right away.    Honestly it was a very unusual cold sore.  Much larger than any cold sore I had ever had.  It even caused bumps on the  interior part of my lower lip.  This has never happened.    In the past this cold sore would be it.  Then I would be free of them for an extended period.  As of April 21, 2021, I&#39;ve had 2 additional cold sores.   This is three cold sores in a period of less then 5 weeks.  My diet, exercise and lifestyle have not really changed.  This is VERY odd.

After midnight a low grade fever started along with chills.  Was shivering quite a lot from about 1:00 AM to 4:30 AM on April 11th.  Had a headache as well starting at midnight along with fever, chills, aches, and shivering.  Body aches and low fever continued through April 11th and were gone by April 12th.  Noticed lymph nodes swelling quite a bit under my left arm (arm that had the shot) through April 15th.  Swelling went away and have not had any side effects since.

                                                I received the vaccine in the right arm and within about 20 seconds I felt like I was going to faint and had rapid heart rate (pulse of 155) measured by EMT. I needed to remove the mask as I was having difficulty with the rapid heart rate and feeling of fainting. I also felt pins and needles type feeling in my legs and my face felt slightly swelled. I felt tired and that tired feeling lasted for the entire day. I stayed at the vaccination site for approximately 30 minutes at the advice of the EMT and went home. Later I had a slight headache but heart rate became more normal.

My fingers and hands have been swollen and throbbing since the second vaccine. My doctor and myself believe it is rheumatoid arthritis triggered from the vaccine. I will have test done to confirm this in 3 months when I received my healthcare back from my employer...

Advised to use an icepack on it and take benadryl for the swelling. Started this treatment on March 13 in the afternoon. Swelling seems to be subsiding slowly each day. Was told by doctor&#39;s office if swelling didn&#39;t start going down by March 17, to call them back.

He was doing well but then 3/24/21 patient noted  his right eye was feeling  &#34;funny&#34; and the next day or 2 it continued and then was hard to close eye on its own.

                                                On  January 8,  I started having a cramping feeling in my right calf. It went on throughout the day without a event.   I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

This is the second of two reports. The reporter describes events following both vaccinations in a vaccine series. This report is for those events which occurred following the second vaccination.      A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3249), intramuscularly on 01Feb2021  (at the age of 57-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia from an unknown date. The patient&#39;s historical vaccinations included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 after which he experienced inflammation, joint pain and burning sensation in the joints. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The vaccination was administered at a hospital. Concomitant medications included acetaminophen (TYLENOL), tamulosin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) all from unspecified dates and for unknown indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Per the reporting physician, he got his first vaccine on 22Dec2020.  His MCP and PIP joints and SI joints started burning close to 3rd week in Jan2021. He had some minor SI pains intermittently before but none with hands. Continued hurting enough that he started taking Osteobiflex and fish oil and more tylenol for inflammation. After second vaccine on 01Feb2021 the symptoms he experienced after the first dose have been getting worse.  He mentioned that his hands burn all the time, at times like tonight bad enough that they keep him awake.  He has red nodular areas on some of his knuckles and a distinct nodule at the proximal ulnar aspect of my left 4th finger PIP that is uniformly erythematous. Not all knuckles have the same degree of burning, but all including thumbs have it. The SI joint pain is more variable and at time does not bother him, but the hands get swollen and tight to close everyday. He plans to start some prednisone tomorrow due to the progression of the burning. The clinical outcomes of the events burning sensation in joints worsened, swelling of hands, stiffness joints, inflammation, condition worsended, erythema, nodule on extremity were reported as not recovered. The outcomes of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administration and off label use were unknown.  It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021154881 Same patient, same drug, different AE, different dose of vaccine.

                                                Evening of the second vaccine, I started developing flu like symptoms. By 2 o?clock in the morning I had a 103 fever and a rash all over my torso. Over the course of the next week, I developed fever blisters and swollen lymph nodes in my armpit on the side of the injection. I have some presently undiagnosed Nuro immune disease that may be transverse myelitis. The Covid vaccine exacerbated all of the symptoms of the Neuro immune condition.

Next morning, &#34;pinching feeling&#34; in left underarm. After continuing to feel this, I finally went and looked and found a &#34;red spot&#34; at the point of the greatest soreness and also noted swelling of the general area. This soreness has continued on through to today (3/29/2021).

Symptoms became worse throughout the day.  Reported sick at work on 3/23 because symptoms were worse.  (measured temperature 98.9 to 99.9 throughout the say, normal temperature for me is 97.5)  Had covid test that came back negative.  Started taking cold relief medications.  Conditions slowly improved over next few days but still don&#39;t feel 100% as of this report.

Lower extremities had pitting edema: lower legs and feet. I tried a diuretic (flouresime) but it did not help. I tried elevating legs and no change. Used a tems machine with electrodes to increase blood flow in calves but it did not help. Could not get shoes or socks on and ankles were so swollen that walking was very difficult since range of motion was inhibited and could not bend ankles. No relief until 2 weeks later it is now starting to subside. Still significantly swollen when getting 2nd vaccination today 4/2 at 12;20 pm lot EP7533.

A 57-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Mar2021 (at the age of 57-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included joint pain and ongoing 45-packs per year smoker. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL), hydroxyzine (manufacturer unknown) and diclofenac sodium (manufacturer unknown). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The physician reported, &#34;patient had anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema on separate hospitalization (I was not involved for this but reviewed photos and this was reportedly attributed to the vaccine; I&#39;m uncertain if that event was reported). On hospitalization, the patient was with small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism on a CT PE (CT scan for Pulmonary Embolus). Patient is an active smoker. No other obvious cause.&#34; As a result of the adverse events (unspecified), the patient was hospitalized for one day. The start date of the events was on 29Mar2021. The patient was treated with apixaban (for pulmonary embolism). The clinical outcome of &#34;anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema&#34; and &#34;small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism&#34; was resolving.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for events pulmonary embolism, anaphylactic reaction and associated generalized rash and generalized erythema. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight since discharge from the hospital. In 2021, the patient experienced had fever, temperature 101.1 F. On an unknown date, the patient experienced had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation), steroid induced diabetes, lower extremity edema, 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs, weight slowly coming down, weight up 4 lbs, rash, diarrhea, and leg healing (limb discomfort). In 2021, patient weight was up by 4 lbs since discharge from hospital. The action for nifedipine in response to the events was unknown. The action for methylprednisolone in response to the events was unknown. The action for treprostinil diolamin in response to the events was unknown. The outcome of the events COVID-19 pneumonia, drug ineffective, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation was unknown. The outcome of the events rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unknown date in 2021.  Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia , and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the consistency with the known safety profile of the suspect product BNT162B2, events of COVID-19 pneumonia, Drug ineffective, Fever, Diarrhea could be related to the suspected drug of BNT162B2. All the other events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.  The reported events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Nifedipine.  The events of Diabetes steroid-induced is most likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus. All the other events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Medrol.   Medical history of ongoing Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH/ High BP disorder/ increased pressure of pulmonary circulation), ongoing Systemic lupus erythematosus, and ongoing Dyspnoea may provide explanations for some of the events (such as Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Volume overload, Mitral regurgitation, and Oedema peripheral).   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This is a solicited report received on 31Mar2021 from a consumer via (pharmacy name). Patient began therapy with Orenitram (treprostinil diethanolamine), on 01 Aug 2019 for primary pulmonary arterial hypertension. The patient was supplied with Orenitram 0.25mg, 1mg, 2.5mg and 0.125mg and the current dose was reported as 3.875mg, via oral (PO) route, every eight hours (q8h). On 23Mar2021, the patient experienced event COVID-19 and pneumonia (COVID-19 pneumonia, hospitalization, medically significant).On 23Mar2021, 1 year 7 months 23 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalized due to COVID-19 and pneumonia and discharged on 29 Mar 2021. The patient was on oxygen at the time of reporting. Action taken with PO Orenitram dose for the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was not reported. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was unknown.The reporter did not provide causality for the event of COVID-19 pneumonia. Follow-up information was received as solicited report on 15Apr2021 from a consumer via (pharmacy name). On 06Apr2021, the patient had pneumonia (pneumonia, medically significant and hospitalized). Additional lot number and expiration date were added to 2.5 mg concentration of PO Orenitram. On 06Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 6 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalized due to pneumonia and remained hospitalized at the time of reporting. The patient was also hospitalized in Mar2021 for COVID (previously reported COVID-19 pneumonia). Action taken with PO Orenitram dose for the event of pneumonia was not reported. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the event of pneumonia was unknown. The reporter did not provide causality for the event of pneumonia. Additional spontaneous information was received on 19Apr2021 from a consumer (social worker) via (pharmacy name). Event of pneumonia was omitted and subsumed under COVID-19 pneumonia. Since 06Apr2021, the patient remained hospitalized due to COVID (previously reported COVID-19 pneumonia). Follow-up information was received on 27Apr2021, from a nurse on behalf of the reporting physician via a query response. On 16Apr2021, the patient had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID, AHRF secondary to Influenza B exacerbating PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (acute respiratory failure, hospitalized, medically significant), pulmonary hypertension (pHTN) exacerbation, AHRF (acute hypoxemic respiratory failure) secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, pHTN treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hospitalized and medically significant), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (influenza, hospitalized), volume overload (fluid overload, hospitalized). On an unreported date in 2021, the patient had fever, temperature 101.1 F (pyrexia). On an unreported date, the patient had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) (mitral valve incompetence, medically significant), steroid induced diabetes (steroid diabetes, medically significant), lower extremity edema, 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs (oedema peripheral), weight slowly coming down, weight up 4 lbs (weight fluctuation), rash (rash), diarrhea (diarrhoea), and leg healing (limb discomfort). On 16Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 16 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalised due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID (previously reported COVID-19 pneumonia) and for AHRF secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, then transferred to the other hospital with volume overload and diuresis. The patient was presented with volume overload and needed oxygen requirement (none needed at home prior to both hospitalizations). The patient&#39;s breathing and oxygen were improved with diuresis. Patient&#39;s pulmonary hypertension was treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus. Patient was given intravenous (IV) solumedrol (25 mg in AM and 16 mg in PM) as per the discussion with rheumatology and pulmonary hypertension cardiology with improvement in oxygen status. On 24Apr2021, the patient relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included: complete blood count (CBC) WBC (white blood count) 4.79, RBC (Red blood cell count) 3.31, Hgb (hemoglobin) 8.4, Plt (Platelet count) 146. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) Na (sodium) 141, K (potassium) 4.1, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 39, Creatinine 1.68, glucose 90. On 25Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.51, RBC 3.24, Hgb 8.2, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 39, Creatinine 1.59, glucose 117. On 26Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.41, RBC 3.30, hgb 8.3, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 37, creatinine 1.54, and glucose 90. The patient was discharged on 26Apr2021. Patient&#39;s physical exam at the time of discharge showed pulse 65 bpm, respiratory rate 18 per minute, blood pressure (BP) 138/78 mmHg, temperature 36.5 °C and weight was 90.9 kg. The patient was breathing comfortably in no distress on 2 Litre nasal cannula (NC). Minimal crackles appreciated in the morning posteriorly. The patient had 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs and edema unchanged but overall leg size decreased. Continues to be pitting but improved on the day of discharge. Patient&#39;s discharge diagnosis pulmonary hypertension exacerbation. Patient&#39;s diuretics were increased from 40 mg daily to 60 mg daily and may needed more diuretics. Discharge medications included: Protonix (pantoprazole), Demadex (torsemide), Medrol (methylprednisolone), Citracal &#43; d (calcium citrate, ergocalciferol), Lanoxin (digoxin), Epipen (epinephrine), Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), Folvite (folic acid), Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine sulfate). Patient&#39;s medications of Pepcid, Lasix, and Aldactone were stopped after discharge from the hospital. The patient was instructed to take pantoprazole 40 mg daily while on steroids and when steroids tapered, he had to discontinue it in future and would stop pantoprazole and resume taking home dose of famotidine. Patient was on nifedipine at home and physician thought to be the contributing factor to lower extremity edema so stopped taking the nifedipine in house. It was reported that steroid induced the diabetes. It was reported that the patient needs transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) due to had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) but not agreeable at that time. The patient tried ethacrynic acid 50 mg daily but felt it was not making a difference with his weight. The patient went back on the Bumex (bumetanide) on Friday. Patient&#39;s weight slowly coming down to see doing good later on Bumex, his rash subsiding and leg was healing. Patient&#39;s weight was stable at 155 lbs and had multifactorial stable shortness of breath (SOB). Patient&#39;s weight was above baseline and needed more diuretics. Patient had been in touch with his COVID positive brother who was symptomatic and refused to be covid testing quarantining at that time. On 24Feb2021, the patient got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and his temperature was 101.1 °F in 2021. The patient would take Tylenol (paracetamol) and monitor if fever persists to 48 hours he would go to the urgent care. Patient was started on Eliquis and felt much better and no longer to had temperatures and diarrhea. On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, CI 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID-19 swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight in Apr 2021 since discharge from the hospital. Action taken with PO Orenitram dose due to the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was updated to dose decreased and for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. Action taken with nifedipine, and Medrol dose for the events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation was unknown. The outcome of the events of rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events of pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unreported date in 2021. The reporter did not provide causality for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea, and limb discomfort. Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia, and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded. Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities. Information on the batch/Lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known safety profile, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of drug ineffective, COVID-19, pneumonia, rash, pyrexia and diarrhoea cannot be excluded. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was secondary to COVID-19, therefore was also considered as related to BNT162B2. The other events were considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to BNT162B2. Steroid diabetes was considered as related to methylprednisolone and other events were unrelated to methylprednisolone. Oedema peripheral and limb discomfort were considered as related to nifedipine and other events were unrelated to nifedipine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 57-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EW0169), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 22Apr2021 08:00 (57-years-old) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization (his cardiologist recommended him to get it and signed him up for it). Medical history included ongoing coronary stents  (Has 18 coronary stents in total. The last three stents were put in 2018), burning of nerves in the back from Apr2021 (The burning of nerves was done through injection), underlying heart issue, neuropathy, diabetes, blood pressure, Cholesterol. Concomitant medications included metformin taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing; pantoprazole from an unspecified start date and ongoing; lorazepam from an unspecified start date and ongoing; gabapentin like a nerve block for neuropathy and diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing; isosorbide taken for slow release nitro for heart from an unspecified start date and ongoing; carvedilol taken as beta blocker and helps blood pressure and stuff from an unspecified start date to 10May2021; rosuvastatin  taken for cholesterol from an unspecified start date and ongoing; ticagrelor (BRILINTA) taken as blood thinner; losartan taken for blood pressure from an unspecified date and unspecified date; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPRIN, Bayer) from an unspecified start date and ongoing; magnesium from an unspecified start date and ongoing; furosemide taken as water pill from an unspecified date and unspecified date; metoprolol from 10May2021 to an unspecified stop date; amlodipine from an unspecified date and from May2021; chlorthalid tabniva taken as water pill (25mg at night at the time of the shot, couple of days ago he had to start cutting it in half, now he is only taking 12.5mg at night). The patient previously took Plavix (Brilinta replaced Plavix to keep his stents open. He was on Plavix over 6 years ago), Fentanyl, and Versed. The patient experienced passed out (hospitalization) on 04May2021, blood pressure is low/blood pressure was 80 something over 50 something (hospitalization) on 01May2021, not feeling well on Apr2021, white blood count is high on an unspecified date, dehydrated on an unspecified date. The patient was hospitalized for passed out and blood pressure is low/blood pressure was 80 something over 50 something from 04May2021 to 05May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood count: 13 on 12May2021.  The patient received Pfizer COVID vaccine and reported after 1st dose received on 22Apr2021 he is not feeling well, he has an underlying heart issue and a history of stents placed, white blood cells are high and has a low blood pressure. His Dr. asked him to call Pfizer to ask if this could have been reported as side effects from vaccination. He was asking if he should get the second dose. He had Pfizer shot and has got to get the second one on Saturday. He doesn&#39;t know if it is related or not. He has been going to the doctor. He has underlying conditions and takes heart medications and has stents. He has not been feeling good since getting the shot. He is not sure if it is affiliated. His white blood count is high and he has to go to the doctor. His doctor is advising him to hold off on getting the second one and told him to call and ask if anyone else has had side effects like that. He clarified shot as COVID19 Vaccine. He saw his cardiologist yesterday and they thought it was interesting that he started having problems. They wanted him to call the phone number and see if he can postpone the second one. He is not sure if it is related to the shot. His blood pressure has been really low (01May2021) since taking the shot. He takes a ton of medications and they are having to adjust his medications since. Not been feeling good is ongoing. It started 3 to 4 days after getting shot.

                                                Heart rate increased; Swelling arm; Arm soreness; soreness at the vaccine injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 13:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) at an unspecified dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history was reported as &#34;no pre-existing conditions.&#34; He mentioned that he reviewed his allergies with a pharmacist prior to vaccination but did not specify what his allergies were. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was a tobacco user from an unknown date. The patient also reported a history of pneumonia which was reported to have occurred on seven different occasions following each of seven different vaccinations with the flu vaccine (manufacturers unknown) prior to 2013. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. He stated that after receiving the COVID 19 Vaccine he had side effects. He said the side effects went away at twenty four hours later, but he is still having one side effect, and has a concern. He clarified that he has an elevated heart rate since getting the COVID 19 Vaccine. He said he has never had an elevated heart rate before getting the COVID 19 Vaccine. He reported his heart rate is normally low, between 62-65. He said when he was at work on 28Dec2020 his heart rate was OK, but prior to going to bed that night his heart rate was 93 - 95. He said he thought at first he was just stressed. He also reported the COVID 19 Vaccine is the only thing he has taken. He mentioned that his heart rate has been down to 93, but then up to 105, and higher. He specified that he first presented with an elevated heart rate between 4:00 5:00PM on Tuesday, 29Dec2020. He said the elevated heart rate subsided enough for him to sleep later that day. He said he then started work around 10:00AM today, 30Dec2020, and felt the elevated heart rate in himself, and didn&#39;t say anything to anyone at work. He said when his heart rate got bad, it was about 12:30PM today and that today (30Dec2020) at work he didn&#39;t feel right at lunch, so he took his oxygen level and heart rate. He said his heart rate was 141. He said he called his primary care doctor, but didn&#39;t go to the emergency room. He said he doesn&#39;t have chest pain. He said he said something about his heart rate to a staff member at work, and the staff member tested his heart rate, and told him it was 141. He said he spoke to the nurse at his doctor&#39;s office, and the nurse said the doctor couldn&#39;t do much, and that he could go to emergency room or their practice&#39;s urgent care that is open until 7:00PM.  He said he tried to go to the hospital emergency room, but ended up driving by because the hospital was so busy they were triaging patient&#39;s in the parking lot. The patient also experienced arm swelling and arm soreness following the vaccination on 28Dec2020. He said he could feel the soreness at the vaccine injection site when he moved his left arm. He stated that the swelling was down to his biceps and it resolved within 12- to 14 hours after the vaccination. As treatment, the patient took a generic 81 mg Baby Aspirin (UPC Number: 050428323922, Lot Number: P110657 Expiration Date: May2020) on 30Dec2020 between 3:00 and 3:30. The patient stated that the generic 81mg baby aspirin was an expired product. The clinical outcome of heart rate increased was not recovered and the clinical outcome of arm swelling, arm soreness and vaccination site soreness was recovered on 28Dec2020.

                                                Right Foot started hurting the night after the vaccine. The next day, it hurt to  walk on it. Mainly around the base of my 2nd and 3rd toes. The next day it hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t walk on it and saw the doctor. A red area had developed on top of my foot at the base on my toes. Doctor though could be Gout but didn&#39;t really look like it and usually that is in the big toes. Plus the timing of this issue and my vaccine were suspect. Had X-ray on that Friday, two days after vaccine and everything looked fine they said. I was prescribed Celebrex  and over the weekend took two per day due to the pain. I stayed in bed all weekend and pain got worse before taking another dose of medicine which helped for a while.  Swelling continued to be about the same or a bit more and the redness moved over to my big toe and then up my foot around towards the right side. Today my right side of foot is really soar now as well and still can&#39;t walk on it and still swollen. Doctor at a urgent care sports medicine location prescribed me Prednisone steroid to see if that helps. But so far 5 days after vaccine and my foot is still swollen, red across the top and so painful it keeps me up at night and I can&#39;t walk on it. I&#39;m hoping the steroids work.

                                                Approximately 45 minutes after receiving the shot I started experiencing some mild tingling/burning in my right shoulder (at the injection site). Shortly afterwards, I also noticed swelling and numbness in my hands and face. The swelling in my hands increased to the point where my ring finger on my left hand began throbbing. The ring is already tight due to weight gain, but I became concerned that I may need to cut the ring off. Throbbing plateaued and continued for about an hour then subsided. Swelling and numbness also plateaued and subsided, though those took longer (about 2 days). Overall, it felt a bit like the time I discovered that I was allergic to shrimp/lobster/crab but it did not progress to the same level (no trouble breathing with this episode).

On Saturday 3/27,21, almost 4 days later, at about 1:00 PM, felt hives breaking out on my sides.  It traveled up to my lower armpits, but never went into my arm areas.  Later that day, it traveled down side of legs, but then dissipated.  I went to bed about 9:30 PM that night with only slight discomfort. At 1:30 AM on Sunday 3/28/21, I awoke with severely swollen lips and face.  My breathing began to get difficult, so I immediately headed to the ER at  (about 30 minutes away). They at first started to give me a dose of Benedryl, but I explained to them that I am allergic to it.  I then instead received some Prednisone and immediately the swelling subsided.  Dr.  prescribed 15 pills over a 5-day span to totally clear up the reaction.

I also notice that my armpit on left side was swelling up.   I figure it would be something that would go away by morning. Woke up on April 22 with a baseball sizes lump under my arm, pain and stiffness in my shoulder, neck and chest. I&#39;m greatly concern since i had  none of these symptoms prior to vaccine.   today is april 23rd and my lump has gotten bigger.

                                                Initial symptom was swollen lymph nodes in left armpit--where I got the shot. I am informed enough to know this means I had active antibodies that recognized the virus and attacked it. This lasted approximately 4 days.  After day 2, this began where I am today; occasional vertigo/loss of balance with persistent high blood pressure/headaches consistent with when I contracted Covid 11/2020. I have been to my primary doctor twice. The possibility of this being a vaccine reaction has never come up. It is as if I have the headache/blood pressure portion of Covid infection all over again.    There is no outcome yet. Having read other people&#39;s comments, it is a waste of time and money to get diagnostic tests, and physicians are guessing. No thank you,  I learned of these symptoms and this website from the many internet forums (one is listed above) where people are discussing their vaccine reactions. I never wanted this vaccine, but there is considerable pressure to get vaccinated, even when you contracted the virus. I feel vaccine passports are going to be forced on people. I regret the decision to do this.  My second shot is scheduled for 4/30, but I am cancelling it, I am certain this is Covid vaccine related. I am a very healthy and physically fit 58 year old that eats well. Don&#39;t drink, don&#39;t smoke, mainly vegetarian diet.

A 58-years-old male patient (boyfriend) received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26Mar2021 08:30 (at 58-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization (So he wouldn&#39;t get Covid). The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. Caller reported that the patient did have pretty much the exact same reaction 30 years ago in 1991 when he had the measles vaccine and was told not to take further measles vaccines after that, patient had rash and hives. It was reported that after, the patient received the shot on 26Mar2021. 9 days later on 04Apr2021, he began he got a rash on his skin all over his body. He got rash, hives and itching. He also had irritation in his throat on 08Apr2021. So, he went to the doctor and the emergency room and he is taking medication and he has been taken the medication for approximately 4-5 days now. Medication worked during the day but by the next morning the rash and itching start all over that. Body rash: Caller reported that the body rash started in the patient&#39;s torso and under the patient&#39;s arms.  Caller reported that the rash spread up the patient&#39;s neck. Caller reported that the patient had a red, itchy rash (04Apr2021) and there were some hives involved. Caller reported that the patient went to his doctor on 05Apr2021 in terrible, miserable shape. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s physician prescribed prednisone. Caller reported that the patient took the prednisone later in the day on 05Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient went to work on 06Apr2021 and felt a little bit better but during the night of Tuesday, 06Apr2021, the rash began to spread again and the patient began to get the hives. Caller reported that the patient went to work on 07Apr2021, after taking a dose of prednisone. Caller reported that the patient called her around 8:00 PM on the evening of 07Apr2021 and stated it&#39;s starting all over again and it&#39;s spreading. Caller stated that the patient reported that he had hives on his neck, his shoulders, his body, his private parts, and his butt.  Hands swollen (07Apr2021): Caller reported that the patient&#39;s right hand was swelling and had swollen to at least 1 or 2 sizes bigger than normal. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s left hand was swelling some. Caller reported that the patient had difficulty squeezing both hands into fists due to the swelling. Caller reported that the patient went to the emergency room during the night of 07Apr2021. Caller reported that the emergency room provider prescribed a stronger dose of prednisone and administered prednisone to the patient in the emergency room. Caller reported that the patient did not go to work on 15Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient took a dose of the new, stronger prednisone and the prednisone seemed to settle the rash down a little bit. Caller reported that around 3:00 AM 07Apr2021 into Friday, 08Apr2021, the rash started all over again. Caller reported that the patient already had an appointment scheduled with his physician for 08Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s physician referred him to an allergist and the allergist prescribed Fexofenadine HCl 180 mg and Famotidine 40 mg. Caller reported that so far, the fexofenadine and famotidine seem to be working. It was also reported that patient had Burning sensation in esophagus on 08Apr2021. Caller reported that the concern of her and the patient is that the patient is scheduled to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine this Friday, 16Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist is recommending that he wait another 2 weeks to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she and the patient are going to go to the appointment on 16Apr2021 and request for the appointment to be rescheduled for 2 weeks later. Caller reported that she is very concerned if the patient should be getting a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine or not. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist informed the patient that the patient could get Covid-19 and die from that, but that the patient won&#39;t die from the allergic reaction he is experiencing. Caller reported that she questions the allergist&#39;s opinion because of the misery that the patient has been in. Caller stated that she just needs some answers. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist had stated that there was one other person that he was aware of that had a reaction 10 days after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that it was odd that the rash had started 10 days in, and reported that the patient ruled out food and ruled out any changes as the patient hadn&#39;t changed soap or laundry detergent recently. Details were not provided for the other patient the allergist reported had a delayed reaction 10 days after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist thinks the Covid-19 vaccine caused the patient&#39;s reaction. Caller reported that she and the patient are scared about whether he should get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and are unsure of what she and the patient should do at this point. Caller stated that she knows that people don&#39;t like to give advice, but that they say if you have immediate adverse reaction you shouldn&#39;t get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that the patient&#39;s reaction wasn&#39;t immediate, and asked if it the rash should still be considered an adverse reaction and the patient should not go get second the second dose, or should the patient go with what his doctor said as it is recommended that you should listen to physician. Body rash: Caller reported that the patient&#39;s rash has dissipated for the most part. Caller reported that the patient still has some redness in parts, but the itching has subsided at least as of this morning, 12Apr2021, when she spoke to the patient around 6:00 AM. Hands swollen: Caller reported that the swelling the the patient&#39;s hands went down in the emergency room on Wednesday, 07Apr2021, night and began to dissipate on Thursday, 08Apr2021, with 50 mg of prednisone. Caller reported that she believes the patient&#39;s hands have returned to normal at this point, reporting that the patient is at work and as a mechanic, the patient has to work with hands. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s primary care physician did take blood work, but the patient&#39;s allergist said that the results of the bloodwork would probably not be relevant based on fact that the patient was on medication at the point that the labs were drawn. Caller reported that she believed the initial prescription for prednisone was 10 mg tablets. Caller reported that the patient had to take 4 tablets the first day, 3 tablets the second day, 2 tablets the third day, and 1 tablet after that. Caller reported that she and the patient are concerned about the patient getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she and the patient are trying to anticipate what would happen after the patient received the second dose. Caller stated that she would like to know if someone would recommend or say it&#39;s ok for the patient to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and if the patient has a reaction, that it won&#39;t be as life threatening as getting Covid-19. Prednisone did not help rash, hives, or itching (10 mg tablets, dispensed in pharmacy bottle). Outcome of the events red, itchy rash; body rash; body rash/patient did have pretty much the exact same reaction 30 years ago in 1991 when he had the measles vaccine and was told not to take further measles vaccines after that; and hands swollen was recovering. Events had some irritation in throat and burning sensation in esophagus was recovered on 09Apr2021; while other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                DVT in right leg; Swelling in right leg; Discomfort in right leg while walking; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 10Mar2021 at 16:30 (batch/lot number: EN6208) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (wanted the protection). Medical history included deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from Jul2018 and ongoing. No family medical history relevant to the adverse events. Concomitant medication included warfarin taken for maintenance level for history of DVT from Aug2020 and ongoing. The patient experienced DVT in right leg on 02Apr2021, swelling in right leg on 15Mar2021 and discomfort in right leg while walking on 15Mar2021. The patient reported that he had a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and he believes that it was directly related to the COVID-19 vaccine. He reported that he has a history of blood clots in his right leg going back to 2018. He reported that his most recent DVT was in Aug2020 and he was cleared in Nov2020. He reported that he received the COVID-19 vaccine on 10Mar2021. He reported that on 15Mar2021, he started to notice his right leg swelling. He reported that he called his physician on 29Mar2021 and that his physician ordered an ultrasound. He reported that he had the ultrasound on 02Apr2021 and a deep vein thrombosis was found again. Swelling in right leg: he reported that the swelling has gone down. He reported that the reason that he mentioned that he has a history of blood clots was because of his warfarin dosage. He reported that he was first diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis in Jul2018. He reported that he went through that cycle and that his maintenance level of warfarin was maybe 10 or 12 mg of warfarin per day. He reported that he had another deep vein thrombosis in Aug2020, and since Aug2020 he has been on 17 mg of warfarin daily. He reported that the blood level on warfarin maintenance was supposed to be between 2 and 2.5. He reported that now because of the deep vein thrombosis he experienced in Aug2020, his doctor wanted his level to be at 2.5 to 3.5. He stated that he doesn&#39;t think that at that blood level for his warfarin that he should have gotten a blood clot. He reported that something compromised or interfered with the warfarin, resulting in a deep vein thrombosis. Discomfort when walking: he reported that it feels like his leg was compressing. He reported that the discomfort seems to have gotten better. He was queried for details of warfarin prescription. He reported that the 10 or 12 mg warfarin tablets that he had been taking when the blood clot was diagnosed in Aug2020 have been consumed and he no longer has the bottle. He reported that he did not have the bottle with him for his current warfarin prescription. He reported that the warfarin was not auto-refilled by the pharmacy. He reported that the warfarin was only prescribed a week or two at a time. Investigations: he reported that since Aug2020 when the deep vein thrombosis returned, he started doing self INR tests at home. He reported that he constantly self-monitors his INR at home and his levels were consistently at 3.0 to 3.1. He reported that he monitors his INR at least once a week, sometimes twice a week depending on how he feels. He reported that sometimes his INR goes over 4 and he can feel it. He reported that his system was a little off when it feels too high so he knows how to adjust. He reported that he last checked his INR today, 15Apr2021, and that it was 4.0. He reported that he typically checks his INR on Wednesday. He reported that he keeps a log of his INR levels. He reported that he did not see his physician on 29Mar2021, but that he called his physician and his physician wrote a prescription for the caller to get an ultrasound. Vaccination facility type was pharmacy. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room and physician office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He reported that he doesn&#39;t usually get vaccines. BNT162B2 second dose (lot number: ER5729) was administered on an unspecified date; anatomical location: left arm. The outcome of the events was recovering.

I then received a second dose (Lot # EN6206) on 3/13/21.  Over that weekend the pain in my leg grew worse and the leg began to swell. on 3/15, I went to my primary care physician who said it looked like a blood clot. He sent me to a radiologist for an ultrasound (?) of the leg. After confirming the clot, I went to a local ER. They started me on Eliquis to treat the clot

A 59-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: EN6207, Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (at the age of 59 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lupus from 2020 and ongoing, ongoing High Blood Pressure, Spinal Surgeries from 1999, Chronic Pain,Retention water, blood clot issue. The patient previously had tetanus shot. Concomitant medications included losartan potassium; allopurinol; hydroxychloroquine; methocarbamol; morphine sulfate (MS CONTIN); oxycodone; furosemide.  Caller states he is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine. Seven days later the dose of vaccine (18Mar2021), patient developed Bell&#39;s Palsy which he has never had before and has never had any other problem with. He has seen an ENT, his pain doctor, and his medical doctor and they all say the Covid vaccine has caused the problem he is having. He was told by his ENT this is very possibly permanent. Emergency Doctors are who he went to because he thought he was having a stroke, because half of his face went numb. He has been to the doctor 10 times in the last 7 days, it has not been fun at all. He didn&#39;t put it together until he saw the ENT, who said Bell&#39;s Palsy is caused from a virus. States he had no idea until he said that, that it could possibly be from the injection. States he has never had Bells Palsy before and it started 8 days after the initial shot. His right eyelid was sticking on his eye and wouldn&#39;t shut and he couldn&#39;t move his face on the left side and he can&#39;t control it at all. Clarifies he couldn&#39;t shut his right eye all of the way. Since then they have told him he needs to tape his eye shut for 12 hours a day to keep from going blind. The thing that bothers him is his eye sight in that eye is getting worse every day even though he uses the cream and tapes it shut. His wife told him even with both eyes shut, it will not completely shut because his lower eyelid is hanging down too far. The ENT told him he needs a hearing test today at 2:00p.m. to see if this is going to be a permanent problem. He is getting ready to go to the ear doctor to find out more. At the same time he developed the Bells Palsy, his blood got really thin and wouldn&#39;t clot which seems really weird. Also on 18MAR2021, his left hand got really swollen and the entire arm bruised and they said the edema in his hand got to the point where his skin was cracking because his blood got so thin that it couldn&#39;t clot at all. He had a blood clot issue in the past. States his arm and hand have improved, he can move his hand again finally. The ENT said that since he has been on Prednisone, for recovery for Bells Palsy, for over a week and gotten worse instead of better, it may be permanent. Prednisone is not working, it has actually gotten worse. Prednisone 10mg for 7 days and to decrease by one tablet every day until gone but states he has gotten worse. Treatments (assessed as for all events): Prednisone. States that it has been two weeks since this happened and the doctor told him the only other option is skull surgery. The bones in his head would be drilled out to make room for the nerves in hopes he would be able to work his mouth again, so not a good thing. Eye cream. He is on disability and his house payment is 3/4 of what he makes, so he can&#39;t take care of the medical bills himself otherwise he wouldn&#39;t worry about it. It is very depressing. His medical doctor said he hadn&#39;t seen any cases of Bell&#39;s Palsy for 2 years, and he has seen 4 in the last week so that doesn&#39;t give him a lot of confidence even though he is still encouraging people to get the vaccine because it is safer than not.He has multiple visits to the ER 3 times between 18MAR2021 and 19MAR2021 within 24 hours; states he was in the ER for hours and hours but no admission. States they did a CT Scan, MRI, CT with contrast and then after that ended up 22 saw ENT who confirmed the fact that Covid Vaccine that gave Bells Palsy and on 22-23 saw his GM again. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None within 4 weeks; states 9 months ago he had a Tetanus Shot. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy, Visual acuity decreased, Eyelid disorder, Orofacial dyskinesia, numbness in face was not recovered; other events was recovering. All events happened on 18Mar2021.

                                                Thumb hurt; Hand swelled up; Elbow was swollen; Intense pain in the elbow; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 59-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, at age of 59 years old, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 09:45 (Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure increased from 1995 and ongoing (It is controlled), anxiety (young and suffering from anxiety, has no clue why) and family cancer history. The patient previous received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 19Mar2021 09:45 (Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at age of 59 years old, at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He received the Covid vaccine on 09Apr2021. The following day he later noticed his elbow started bothering him that night, and around midnight it woke him up. He had intense pain in the elbow and tried to tough it out. 4 hours later he was in the ER, it was that bad. When he got there they did an ultrasound and some X-rays. The ultrasound showed his elbow was swollen, and they removed 17cc of fluid. They asked if he had any trauma to his arm and he said absolutely no way. He doesn&#39;t know what to think. He was trying to find someone to help with the issue. On a scale of 1 to 10 the pain was a strong 10. To this day it was still bothering him pretty bad. He coundn&#39;t work because of it. He could hardly straighten it out because it is so sore. It was painful, but not as bad as Saturday(10Apr2021) and Sunday(11Apr2021) morning. On 13Apr2021, his hand swelled up. That&#39;s gone away. His thumb hurt on 14Apr2021 and that had gone away, he just aced that. He put ice on his elbow. His elbow from last night(13Apr2021) to today (14Apr2021) probably had a 30 percent change. It is getting better but it is still sore. He can&#39;t straighten it and he is trying to bend it to work it so it doesn&#39;t get stiff. With the work he does he needs to use his arms. He works in construction. He got the shot on 09Apr2021, and the pain was later in the day. He received his dose around 0945, and at about 1500 to 1530 he noticed his elbow bothering him. Later that night when he went to bed he was uncomfortable and couldn&#39;t sleep. Eventually he did fall asleep and at 0000 he woke up in excruciating pain. He tried to deal with it until 0400 when he went to the ER. His pain is nowhere near what it was. When he tries to straighten it, it is very painful, about a 6. If he bends it back it is much better. If he tries to straighten it the pain level goes up. It is still swelled up a bit. It is hard to say if it has improved, he never really saw it. He went to bed and when he woke up he was in so much pain. He had on his PJs and put on his shoes and left. All he knew was he was in pain. He presumed it was more swollen then, they did the ultrasound and found all that fluid. The pain in his thumb subsided a bit. He took the ice off of it about 30 minutes before this phone call, so about 45 minutes ago. It feels a little better. At least one part of the puzzle is solved. He noticed it at about 0730 this morning. He had an ultrasound on 11Apr2021. He had 3 to 4 X-rays on 11Apr2021. Outcome for events was not recovered. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information expected

One day it felt like a giant hand was squeezing me around the chest and back.  Random periods of nausea.  One day I had overwhelming fatigue, it took every ounce of my strength to lift myself.  It felt like something was laying on me pushing me down.  Another day my upper  right lip and upper right face swelled. Arm hurt at vaccine site.  All this went on over a period of 2 weeks.  To this day my upper right lip randomly swells.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 59-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8732) at the age of 59-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Mar2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. He has no known allergies and has COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, rosuvastatin, oxybutynin, and tamsulosin. There were no other vaccines in four weeks and no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient reported that he was having some wild effects from the vaccine and did not know what to do. On 26Mar2021 at 15:00, he was having neuropathy like effects. His hands, arms, legs, and feet were experiencing pain and burning sensations, they were burning like nerve damage; he also has a little burning sensation in his nose and cheeks. He has never had this before. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. He was also having some weird sensations in his calf muscles, these sensations started within the past week and a half (Apr2021) which prompted physician office visit. The physician placed him on gabapentin 100 mg to start from 12Apr2021, but it was not enough, it was titrated up to 300 mg, three times a day and he is scheduled to see specialist soon. The patient mentioned that this vaccine has ruined his health. He also went to an urgent care center because his leg was bothering him, it was swelling on an unspecified date in 2021; he thought he had a blood clot; they did some kind of test where they looked at the leg and did not find anything. He didn&#39;t have a particular question. He would just like to talk to someone to see if this was going on with anyone else, if it will go away, or if this was permanent problem he will have. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. He received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 13Apr2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Went to bed and woke up about 3 hours later (e.g. 15 hours after injection).  Suffering from full body aches, headache (even my teeth and eyes hurt), chills, uncontrolled shaking, followed by uncontrolled sweating, muscle spasms, nausea, severe pain at injection site, swollen and painful lymph node in left armpit.  Little to no sleep that night.  In a fog all day Sunday, low grade fever just below 100.  Went to bed early (around 8:30pm) with similar but reduced symptoms.  Pain at injection site has subsided by now.  Shakes and chills are far less but still there.  Still sweating, really bad body aches, headache, swollen and tender lymph node under left arm.  Challenge sleeping but did a little better.  Today, Monday, still in a serious fog.  No energy.  Other symptoms appear to be subsiding

Reported Event: &#34;I had my first shot in my left arm on March 28th. I only had minor injection muscle site tightness &amp; pain that resonated down my left arm for 2-4 days. On April 6th, I tested positive for Covid (Nasal Swab) and experienced fevers, muscle aches shortness of breath, lung pain, severe swelling &amp; pain in my neck &amp; shoulders which persisted until April 16th. I had a second COVID PCR test on April 16th (Nasal Swab). which was also positive. I also have experienced severe fatigue since the onset of Covid on April 6th with only mild relief coming over the last few days beginning on May 1st.&#34; Adverse events result in Emergency room/department or urgent care, patient recovered with lasting effects, and no treatment received for events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome for events was Recovered/Resolved with Sequel(except for Product use for unapproved combination).  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021497277 same patient, same drug, different AE, different dose of vaccine.

A 59-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm on 19Dec2020 (Lot Number: EL0140) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergy to cashews. The patient did not receive any medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient experienced lost use of legs and left arm hurt (at injection site) at the same time as weakness on 31Dec2020. Called ambulance, the patient went to ER. Evaluated for Stroke-like symptoms (negative). Guillain-Barre was suspected and EMG (Electromyography) confirmed it. The patient was hospitalized for event guillain-barre for 54 days. Event guillain-barre was also assessed as life-threatening and disability. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room visit. Treatment for events included IV-IG (Intravenous immunoglobulin); pneumothrombectomy (clots caused by IV-IG). The patient underwent nasal swab tests on 31Dec2020, 11Jan2021, 04Feb2021 and blood test on 24Mar2021, all were negative. The patient was not to have any more COVID vaccine per Neurology. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of Guillain-Barre cannot be excluded.

I have been using conservative treatments  at home, everyday for 2 weeks.  ice, heat, over the counter anti-inflammatory meds. The adverse condition persists. To date, I have not sought medical attention from a orthopedic specialist but have an upcoming appointment scheduled. I do not know for sure if the covid vaccine has caused a flare-up of inflammation in an old Achilles? tendon injury but it does seem quite coincidental that having had no pain or problems with my old injury from 12 years ago, that two day after receiving the covid-19 vaccine, I have swollen inflammation in my tendon causing great difficulty in walking.

A 59-years-old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6204, Expiry date: unknown), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 12Mar2021 at 17:30 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patent medical history included asthma he hasn&#39;t had a bad asthma attack like this since he was 5yrs old and Nut allergy. Patient Concomitant medication included Trospium Chloride. After the First 1st dose on Friday (12Mar2021) and 5-6hours later at around 11:30pm he had a terrible asthma attack, he had difficulty breathing, it started out with a cough then wheezing that kept getting worse, he did not have an inhaler that was not at least 10yrs old. He was lying down, so he sat up and that helped him. he didn&#39;t&#39; want have the ambulance come over or take him to the hospital because it&#39;s too expensive and he don&#39;t have insurance. He thought he was having an anaphylactic reaction, like the caption drive ship in the storm. So, he sat up for 2 hours because I could not lie down could not breathe when he lies down. So, he sat up and pulled for breath and he had a terrible asthma attack, terrible wheeze, and coughing. If he would have started to get blotchy and swollen, then he probably would have call back the ambulance. He called the information for the number, hospital, they gave me the neurology department in the hospital for whatever reason he does not know. Then he called the police station and then googled phone number for the hospital that does not work anymore, and he could not call the hospital then he called the police station they tell him not to keep following. That is quite alright he had that Covid shot if he dies overnight then you can document what he told but he did not die overnight because he is feeling better, but the question is has not had an asthma attack like that since he was like 5 years old. The outcome is Unknown for all the events  Response: Unable to determine how someone will react to 1st or 2nd dose. Referred to HCP on recommendations for 2nd dose.
