The patient has no medical history and concomitant medications.  The physician reported that he got the COVID Vaccine on 18Dec2020 and he got Lymphadenopathy as a possible side effect of the vaccine. It was recently (03Jan2021), he noticed an enlarged lymph node (Lymph node is on left supraclavicular, so above the clavicle on the left side). It could be unrelated, but he was told to call and report it. He would like to know were there patients in the clinical trial who got lymphadenopathy (which part of the body). He did not received treatment. He knows that lymphadenopathy was reported in the study. The reported considered the event as non-serious. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The first couple days I had a really sore left arm, but didn?t feel any ?side effects? until about Wednesday, 1/6 (about a week later). I remember waking up to a sore left side of my upper body. The left side of my neck, chest, arm, and lymph node (under my left arm) felt weird. It was until about Saturday night, 1/9, that I felt my left under arm lymph node noticeably swollen. I had a bad headache and loss of energy, and overall feeling unwell. No fever or night sweats to report. I was absent from work on 1/11 and 1/12, as a result.  1/13 was my first day back and feel better. The swollen left lymph node is no longer present, but still slightly tired. I did not seek Medical Care for my symptoms.

                                                Starting at 8pm on vaccination day I got loopy and disoriented, and had a hard time speaking intelligibly.  I also had trouble with balance and fine motor skills.  Had some personality changes too: became very moody with erratic mood swings. The next day I slept all day because of exhaustion and aches. When I woke up on Wednesday (36hrs later) I was literally screaming in pain because of how bad my arm and shoulder hurt. It hurt to move it, and hurt not to move it.  It was excruciating and ibuprofen didn&#39;t seem to help at all. Throughout Wednesday I could hardly move my left arm. Getting dressed or washing my hair was very difficult and very painful.  I was also still very uncoordinated. My left armpits lymph nodes were so swollen that (1) it filled in my entire armpit so there was no more pit, just a very soft bulge, and (2) the fluid extended all the way to my chest and it looked like I had one breast and one pec.

So, it was between his armpit his heart where he felt the bubble; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (parent). A 40-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 (at the age of 40-year-old) as single dose indicated to prevent from Corona virus (Covid-19 Immunization). Medical history included seizures and gout. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included unspecified medication for seizures. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: ER8730) on 24Mar2021 for Covid-19 Immunization. The patient got the second Pfizer shot later this month, left the office, 45 minutes later (on 14Apr2021) he had seizures and ended up in emergency room. He has had small seizures but they are not back to back, of and on throughout the years and now we are saying that maybe COVID Vaccine shot is what provoked him to, what made him had seizures. Reporter stated, even though he has had seizures in the past like it could be 2, 3 years apart for one. But the shot it caused him to have another seizure, but he is not going to continue to have seizures, as he is on medication (unspecified medication) right now. But the medication is on, if they take him off it, he could have multiple seizures constantly (name of medication not clarified further). Also on 14Apr2021, the patient also had a scar in left arm, it is another symptom he had. He had the scar in his left arm before he had a seizure, he said over here between his heart and his arm felt like a (incomplete sentence), now they don&#39;t know if he had a one scar or what it says but he says that &#39;he could feel a bump, it was like a bump in there. So, it was between his armpit his heart where he felt the bubble&#39; (not clarified further).

I have had back pain before over the years from my job.  However, this pain was the worst its been and lasted more than 2 weeks.  I saw a chiropractor to help with the symptoms.  They have gotten much better, but are still there.   I also noticed that my right and left index finger were swollen and stiff in the knuckle closet to my hand.

A 42-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Lot #: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 (at the age of 42-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not have any known allergies. The patient did not receive any other medications within two weeks prior to the vaccination and did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 30Jan2021 the patient experienced swelling, red spots and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;two weeks after my COVID-19 vaccination I noticed swelling, red spots, and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it. I visited my podiatrist who recommended NSAIDs for a week. Today, my sister in law who is a nurse said it looked like COVID toes. When I googled an image of COVID toes, the spots looked identical to my own.&#34; The adverse events required a physician office visit. The patient received treatment for the events which included NSAIDs. The clinical outcomes of the events swelling, red spots and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it were all not recovered/not resolved. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

A 43-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer COVID 19; lot number: EL3247; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 17Jan2021 09:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known penicillin allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (BACTRIM) but had allergies. The patient historically vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer COVID 19; lot number: EL0140; expiration date: unknown) at the age of 43-year-old via an unspecified route of administration right arm on 29Dec2020 10:00 AM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient received the vaccine in a hospital but 36 hours after the vaccine (18Jan2021), the patient developed chills, body aches and low-grade temperature. Then 48 hours later, her left axilla has become very swollen and painful. The pain has subsided but remains mild and swelling persists. The area seems to show fluid accumulation in the subcutaneous tissue but no erythema or e/o [evidence of (pending confirmation)] abscess infection noted. It&#39;s now been present for 4 days. The patient received treatment which included NSAIDs. The patient had not been COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 44-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at a single dose on the left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 28Dec2020. Since receiving the vaccine, he has experienced multiple side effects at varying time points: pain at injection site left shoulder (experienced pain first day of receiving vaccine on 28Dec2020 and couple of days after fever (unspecified date) resolved (on an unspecified date); he was currently experiencing intermittent minimal pain especially when he wakes up; feels something is different; fever (experienced 08Jan2021); fatigue (developed 07Jan2021). He went to the ER on 08Jan2021 when he developed fever, nausea and shortness of breath which also resolved that day. When he went to ER, his CRP was up a little at 1.1. His PCR and antigen test was negative at that time (08Jan2021); a retest of PCR done 5 days after sxs started (unclear of time window) was negative. He was concerned that he had the fever many days after the vaccine. HCP was asking if any cases of fever and fatigue reported after 7 days (around the 10 day mark) of receiving the first dose. He stated that he is planning on taking the second dose. The patient is a physician calling about the Pfizer covid vaccine. He received his first dose on 28Dec2020. He had a little bit of pain in his left arm on same day, but it went away. About 10 days later, 07Jan2021, he had fever and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, he went to the ER with a temp of 101. He had tachycardia, nausea and shortness of breath. He was not admitted, stated his fever was controlled and his breathing was better. His oxygen was 100% and everything was ok and he was sent home. In the ER he had xrays and labs and everything was ok, except his CRP was a bit up. In the ER he had an antigen and pcr covid test (08Jan2021) and they both came back negative. About 4 or 5 days after the symptoms started, he had an outpatient repeat pcr test and nucleic acid rapid test (unspecified dates) and they both came back negative. He is on his way to get his second dose and he is asking if the symptoms could be side effects from the vaccine. Outcome the event fever was recovered on an unspecified date. Outcome of nausea and shortness of breath was recovered on 08Jan2021, while outcome of pain at injection site left shoulder was recovered on 28Dec2020. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN). Thursday evening (14Jan2021), the patient had slight 1-2/10 substernal chest pain on/off. Friday evening around 23:30 (15Jan2021), the patient had chest pain substernal 7-8/10 that lasted for one hour. The burning sensation was worse with cold air. It resolved with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Monday early morning at 04:00 (18Jan2021), the patient experienced STEMI COVID vaccine induced wherein the patient woke up with 10/10 chest pain and shoulder pain which lasted for 30 to 40 minutes and resolved with paracetamol and ibuprofen. The patient also decided to check blood work Monday morning (18Jan2021) while in the hospital. Trop came back 16.28 ng/ml. This is the old trop not high sensitivity. Normal high is 0.30 ng/ml. The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

                                                At 1700 01/10/2021, he began to feel numbness in his left lip, like he was given a numbing shot at the dentist. Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

                                                Possible symptom 1: Within approximately a day or two of the shot, I developed a severe and persistent lower abdominal/groin pain.  The pain was very pin point in location and lasted for approximately 10 days before easing up.  Very small isolated pain severe enough to go to the DR, but I could not afford to on account of my wife having severe unknown abdominal pain and being in the ER and DR  multiple times herself (she got the same vaccine an hour before me?).  Possible symptom 2:  4-5 days after the shot I developed an isolated and severe pain in a preexisting nodule/mass (lymph node?) located on my mid right thigh, it has never had any sensation before.  The pain was persistently severe for approximately 7 days before easing up.

January 9  - ER - Diagnosed cellulitis - round of Ceflex for a week - things got worse. Since January 9, I&#39;ve had two other separate ER visits and three rounds of CEFLEX. Was referred to Dermatology - Arrhythmia Nodusem  - so now I&#39;m off Ceflex and on a steroid regimen now. I just started it today. It hurts to even touch my skin and it hurts to walk.I&#39;m in  a lot of pain. I have no open wounds so no reason for this to happen.

Caller would like to know if a patient experienced an allergic reaction to the first dose is there anything prophylactically needing to be done when administering the second dose of the Covid vaccine? Caller is very upset and frustrated and stating she wants to speak to someone that is a clinician with the clinical trial team who can give her recommendations for a specific patient.

ADEM suspected and extensive infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic workup was initiated. CT brain  - reported NAD MRI brain consistent with Acute Diffused Encephalomyelitis and suspected ADEM. MRI cervical spine with evidence of demyelination involving posterior cord. ICU course complicated by new onset of aphasia, partial left frontotemporal seizures, LGIB due to proximal rectal laceration and central diabetes insipidus.  Admitted 3/15/21.  On 3/17 he developed aphasia with right sided facial droop and stroke alert was called. Later on 3/17 he developed GI bleeding and was taken for emergent colonoscopy, from which no significant conclusions could be made due to lack of preparation and subsequent poor visualization. No foreign body was reported. After he continued to have ongoing bleeding, the patient had a sigmoidoscopy, during which the migrated clip could be removed and two new hemostatic clips were placed.  He subsequently developed large volume urine output and nephrology was consulted; the patient was diagnosed with likely diabetes insipidus.  On 3/20 acyclovir was discontinued after HSV PCR was negative. High dose solumedrol for ADEM completed 5 day course 3/21.  VDRL was non reactive. There were no oligoclonal bands. Solumedrol 1g daily was started 3/24/21: MRI showed L&gt;R patchy enhancement and diffusion abnormalities consistent with ADEM. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion of the left superior cortex, bilateral medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, genu of the corpus collosum, and pericallosal white matter, with ddx including status epilepticus, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis including herpes simplex.  Completed 5 day course of high dose steroids, 6 days of IVIG and on ongoing PLEX. Neurological improvement noted 3/25

Few days after that I developed numbness and weakness on my left side and pins and needles in my Left index finger. I saw my primary care doctor twice that week. He started me on low dose Prednisone and gabapentin for the pain while sleeping. When the nerve pain/numbness did not subside, I asked for a neurology referral. Two doctors saw me for brachial plexus neuritis. I have had 2 ultrasound guided and one fluoro guided cortisone shots along the nerve. I have also been going to PT 2-3 x/week to regain my strength on the Left side &amp; calm nerve.

Patient described the CP as moderate aching in the substernal area that did not radiate. The pain was intermittent, with each episode lasting 1-2 minutes. The CP was associated with LUE numbness and SOB on exertion. The chest pain and LUE numbness have now resolved. Patient also reports a three week history of RUE swelling. The swelling gradually worsened and is now associated with pain and proximal RUE bruising. RUE pain is rated 5/10. In the ED, patient was found to have NSTEMI and small right lower lobe segmental pulmonary artery embolus.

A 50-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK4176, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the left arm, on 07Jan2021, at 11:30 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient has no medical history and no known allergies . There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first vaccine of bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020, at 12:00 PM, Intramuscular, on the Right arm for Covid-19 immunization, he had numbness in his right hand x2 days. On 09Jan2021, following second dose, he has had numbness in both hands x2 days and on 10Jan2021, day 2, he ran a fever and his lighter weight facial fillers swelled and were painful (around the eyes - not my lip fillers). His eyes have a mix of Juvaderm products. It spontaneously resolved after 1 day with a subjective loss in overall volume. Density of the product used seemed to be a factor in the response. He knows this has been reported with the Moderna product, but he does not believe is has been reported with our product. It appears the response may not be product specific, but more specific to the type of vaccine. The patient has no Covid prior vaccination and not covid tested post vaccination. No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2020.

                                                Client reports swelling in left armpit, assuming lymph node swelling, on Friday evening (over 48 hours after COVID-19 Vaccine #2 was administered in left deltoid). At time of reporting (2/9/21 at 1100) client reports progression of swelling from left armpit to left side of stomach. Client reports &#34;it looks like [he&#39;s] gained about 15 pounds on the left side of my body&#34; from armpit to stomach. Client reports he is having no pain or discomfort, but feels &#34;a noticeable pressure from fluid buildup on left side of body.&#34; Client went to see internal medicine physician 2/9/21. Physician was not concerned at current state but instructed client to monitor and call physician if pain occurs or if swelling noticeably worsens. When asked if swelling was worsening each day, client states it is hard to tell due to the shifting of fluid and &#34;maybe settling due to gravity.&#34;

                                                I received the shot around noon on Tues March 16.  I was fine until 3am Wed March 17 when I woke up general body soreness and sweats.  I had Covid in March 2020 and the feeling was similar without the coughing and much shorter timeframe.  That continued until about 3am on Thursday March 18 when I thought I was almost back to normal.   When I woke up at 6am I thought I was ok but then I realized I had a lump under my left armpit on my side seemingly like my lymph node is swollen.  That continues as I write this at 341pm on Friday March 19.  I also developed hives on my right bicep and on my left and right buttocks and left and right hamstrings.  this is itchy.  I no longer have the soreness, sweating or fatigue but i have the swollen and what seems to be allergic reaction symptoms of hives.

He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck.

                                                Shortly after receiving the injection my arm went ice cold all the way to my fingers and warmed up again quickly. On the way home (about an hour later) I noticed numbness and tingling in my hand and that has continued since (11 days as of this report). My upper arm muscle was sore later that evening and by the next day the pain in my upper arm was extreme. I couldn&#39;t move my arm without extreme pain. I took some tylenol late in the day and that did help cut down on some of the pain. I also put an ice pack on my upper arm but it didn&#39;t help. The pain wasn&#39;t as bad the next (3rd) day but it&#39;s still significant enough for me to restrict activity with it. There is also a burning sensation off and on as well as itching deep in my arm. My upper arm has also felt like there is a tight band around it (since day 2) although the muscles themselves don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s any tightness or knots. I took ibuprofen on day 10 and it helped a little but not a whole lot. At this point I also have what feels like swelling or tenderness under my arm near the armpit area. The pain, burning and itching in my upper arm continues as well as the numbness, tingling and pins all up and down my arm to my hand and fingers.

On 12Mar2021, he developed similar pain on the right side, but it was a more intense pain/tenderness and lasted maybe 4 days. He still experiences it, but less frequently. He is not sure if he is describing it correctly. During the afternoon, it gets a bit more tender. He doesn&#39;t feel it in the morning, but by the afternoon he notices the pain/tenderness. He did not know if there were any reports of contralateral lymphadenopathy (lymph node pain). He clarified that there is no redness or lump- he doesn&#39;t feel anything, even if he touches it there&#39;s no pain, but periodically there will be a shooting tenderness. He feels like it&#39;s getting better, but it is still persisting. He clarified that on the right side- he is experiencing pain near the axilla, underneath the arm next to the chest. He is waiting to see if it is improving and doesn&#39;t know how long he should wait. He stated that it wasn&#39;t that painful on the left side, it was just a little tender; he knew something was different. The pain wasn&#39;t always there. Sometimes there&#39;s a little pain on the left side still, but not as intense as the right side. The pain is there, it&#39;s not worsening but it is not improving.

One vial of two was diluted incorrectly with less Normal Saline than require. This error was not noticed until person mixing vaccine said they were out of vaccine and did not have enough to get 5 dosages of 0.3ml. Two people mixed one vial of vaccine together demonstrating to the other. It appears the person making the error did not notice they did not have 1.8ml of NS but must have had some air and did not realize it. The error was noticed when all the vaccines were given and one person had not completed pulling up the vaccine. So, 2 of 7 patients received the incorrect dose of vaccine and it could not be determined which two received the incorrect dose. Patient report; slightly sore arm, some slight body aches---resolved

Patient also had mild fever for the last two days and was on Tylenol, blood pressure also remained elevated moderately than the usual readings. Patient was admitted through ER for 2 days and was discharged on 1/24/21, with a diagnosis of possible TIA, Todd&#39;s paresis post seizure. Patient&#39;s CT head and MRI of brain was negative for acute stroke. Patient&#39;s left facial droop and right side facial puffiness resolved over a week but noticed to have right sided pronounced weakness with moderate swelling on right arm. Patient used to eat by himself,but now not able to do so and not able to hold cup in the right hand. Patient was again sent to ER for repeat CAT scan of head, further evaluation and management. Not sure if patient had an adverse reaction to Covid-19 vaccination, but definitely these symptoms were developed after 2 weeks of receiving Pfizer vaccination, which may be coincidental. Patient was followed up by the neurologist a week after the discharge from hospital who couldn&#39;t rule out adverse reaction of vaccination. Patient is awaiting for an EEG, carotid ultrasound and Echo as an out patient.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work.

A 55-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), intramuscular in left arm on 17Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included mixed hyperlipidemia. The patient had no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on Jan2021 via intramuscular. On 17Jan2021, the patient experienced nasal and sinus congestion, rash on chest and face, angioedema of lips and periorbital area and wheezing. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient received an OTC antihistamine and monitored the condition.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a chronological association and known product safety profile, a causal relationship between event angioedema and BNT162B2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

It stopped in the evening but got constant low headaches afterwards. Around 5pm, felt like a change in taste (saltier taste) that was temporary. Has uncomfortable wrist pain like twisting a screwdriver too much. Started feeling itchy today after 9 am. Face was swollen after waking up today and has subsided greatly since.

                                                anaphylaxis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified),  via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 05Dec2020 11:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; and amoxicillin, clavulanic acid (AUGMENTIN), via an unspecified route of administration from 18Mar2021 at unspecified dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), AV Nodal block, and pacemaker. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 18Mar2021 20:00, the patient experienced anaphylaxis. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days on an unspecified date due to the event. The patient reported that he was on augmentin on and off for years and when he got his first vaccine. And on 18Mar2021, he began augmentin again and had anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization. The patient was asking if this was related to the vaccine, but seems to be a possibility. The event resulted in resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The event was treated with epinephrine, steroids, benadryl, and fluids. There was no other vaccine in 4 weeks and patient had not had Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The action taken in response to the event for amoxicillin, clavulanic acid was unknown. Outcome of event was recovered in 2021.  Information on batch/lot number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the event anaphylaxis is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2. The event occurred more than 3 months after the administration of vaccine and can be attributed to augmentin based on provided information, including close temporal relationship and positive rechallenge.

                                                experiencing swelling in the armpit of the arm I was injected in; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional, reporting for himself.  A 56-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), lot number: EJ1685, via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at 15:30 (at the age of 56 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination.  Medical history was not reported. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included famotidine (Pepcid AC) for an unknown indication from unknown dates. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination, but did receive the first dose of  BNT162B2, lot number: EJ1685 on 16Dec2020 at 11:00 AM in the right arm. On 08Jan2021, the patient experienced swelling in the armpit of the arm he was injected in. The patient did not receive treatment for the event. The event did involve doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The clinical outcome of swelling in the armpit of the arm he was injected in was not recovered. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Was told by doctor&#39;s office if swelling didn&#39;t start going down by March 17, to call them back.

                                                24 hours after the second vaccine I had crushing, tightness in my chest. It felt like a myocardial infarction. It lasted 24 hours. I had difficulty doing my job. I considered going to the ER to rule out a myocardial infarction not related to the vaccine. I also had bone pain in right forearm and hand which lasted 24 hours. In addition, I had muscle pain in my entire upper body but not lower body. On day 2 I had right axillary swelling and pain.

                                                On  January 8,  I started having a cramping feeling in my right calf. It went on throughout the day without a event.   I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

This is the second of two reports. The reporter describes events following both vaccinations in a vaccine series. This report is for those events which occurred following the second vaccination.      A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3249), intramuscularly on 01Feb2021  (at the age of 57-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia from an unknown date. The patient&#39;s historical vaccinations included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 after which he experienced inflammation, joint pain and burning sensation in the joints. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The vaccination was administered at a hospital. Concomitant medications included acetaminophen (TYLENOL), tamulosin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) all from unspecified dates and for unknown indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Per the reporting physician, he got his first vaccine on 22Dec2020.  His MCP and PIP joints and SI joints started burning close to 3rd week in Jan2021. He had some minor SI pains intermittently before but none with hands. Continued hurting enough that he started taking Osteobiflex and fish oil and more tylenol for inflammation. After second vaccine on 01Feb2021 the symptoms he experienced after the first dose have been getting worse.  He mentioned that his hands burn all the time, at times like tonight bad enough that they keep him awake.  He has red nodular areas on some of his knuckles and a distinct nodule at the proximal ulnar aspect of my left 4th finger PIP that is uniformly erythematous. Not all knuckles have the same degree of burning, but all including thumbs have it. The SI joint pain is more variable and at time does not bother him, but the hands get swollen and tight to close everyday. He plans to start some prednisone tomorrow due to the progression of the burning. The clinical outcomes of the events burning sensation in joints worsened, swelling of hands, stiffness joints, inflammation, condition worsended, erythema, nodule on extremity were reported as not recovered. The outcomes of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administration and off label use were unknown.  It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021154881 Same patient, same drug, different AE, different dose of vaccine.

                                                Right Foot started hurting the night after the vaccine. The next day, it hurt to  walk on it. Mainly around the base of my 2nd and 3rd toes. The next day it hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t walk on it and saw the doctor. A red area had developed on top of my foot at the base on my toes. Doctor though could be Gout but didn&#39;t really look like it and usually that is in the big toes. Plus the timing of this issue and my vaccine were suspect. Had X-ray on that Friday, two days after vaccine and everything looked fine they said. I was prescribed Celebrex  and over the weekend took two per day due to the pain. I stayed in bed all weekend and pain got worse before taking another dose of medicine which helped for a while.  Swelling continued to be about the same or a bit more and the redness moved over to my big toe and then up my foot around towards the right side. Today my right side of foot is really soar now as well and still can&#39;t walk on it and still swollen. Doctor at a urgent care sports medicine location prescribed me Prednisone steroid to see if that helps. But so far 5 days after vaccine and my foot is still swollen, red across the top and so painful it keeps me up at night and I can&#39;t walk on it. I&#39;m hoping the steroids work.

Caller reported that the patient had a red, itchy rash (04Apr2021) and there were some hives involved. Caller reported that the patient went to his doctor on 05Apr2021 in terrible, miserable shape. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s physician prescribed prednisone. Caller reported that the patient took the prednisone later in the day on 05Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient went to work on 06Apr2021 and felt a little bit better but during the night of Tuesday, 06Apr2021, the rash began to spread again and the patient began to get the hives. Caller reported that the patient went to work on 07Apr2021, after taking a dose of prednisone.

Caller reported that the patient did not go to work on 15Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient took a dose of the new, stronger prednisone and the prednisone seemed to settle the rash down a little bit. Caller reported that around 3:00 AM 07Apr2021 into Friday, 08Apr2021, the rash started all over again. Caller reported that the patient already had an appointment scheduled with his physician for 08Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s physician referred him to an allergist and the allergist prescribed Fexofenadine HCl 180 mg and Famotidine 40 mg.

Caller reported that the concern of her and the patient is that the patient is scheduled to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine this Friday, 16Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist is recommending that he wait another 2 weeks to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she and the patient are going to go to the appointment on 16Apr2021 and request for the appointment to be rescheduled for 2 weeks later. Caller reported that she is very concerned if the patient should be getting a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine or not. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist informed the patient that the patient could get Covid-19 and die from that, but that the patient won&#39;t die from the allergic reaction he is experiencing. Caller reported that she questions the allergist&#39;s opinion because of the misery that the patient has been in. Caller stated that she just needs some answers. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist had stated that there was one other person that he was aware of that had a reaction 10 days after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that it was odd that the rash had started 10 days in, and reported that the patient ruled out food and ruled out any changes as the patient hadn&#39;t changed soap or laundry detergent recently. Details were not provided for the other patient the allergist reported had a delayed reaction 10 days after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist thinks the Covid-19 vaccine caused the patient&#39;s reaction. Caller reported that she and the patient are scared about whether he should get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and are unsure of what she and the patient should do at this point. Caller stated that she knows that people don&#39;t like to give advice, but that they say if you have immediate adverse reaction you shouldn&#39;t get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that the patient&#39;s reaction wasn&#39;t immediate, and asked if it the rash should still be considered an adverse reaction and the patient should not go get second the second dose, or should the patient go with what his doctor said as it is recommended that you should listen to physician. Body rash: Caller reported that the patient&#39;s rash has dissipated for the most part. Caller reported that the patient still has some redness in parts, but the itching has subsided at least as of this morning, 12Apr2021, when she spoke to the patient around 6:00 AM.

Caller reported that she believes the patient&#39;s hands have returned to normal at this point, reporting that the patient is at work and as a mechanic, the patient has to work with hands. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s primary care physician did take blood work, but the patient&#39;s allergist said that the results of the bloodwork would probably not be relevant based on fact that the patient was on medication at the point that the labs were drawn. Caller reported that she believed the initial prescription for prednisone was 10 mg tablets. Caller reported that the patient had to take 4 tablets the first day, 3 tablets the second day, 2 tablets the third day, and 1 tablet after that. Caller reported that she and the patient are concerned about the patient getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she and the patient are trying to anticipate what would happen after the patient received the second dose. Caller stated that she would like to know if someone would recommend or say it&#39;s ok for the patient to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and if the patient has a reaction, that it won&#39;t be as life threatening as getting Covid-19. Prednisone did not help rash, hives, or itching (10 mg tablets, dispensed in pharmacy bottle).

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 10Mar2021 at 16:30 (batch/lot number: EN6208) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (wanted the protection). Medical history included deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from Jul2018 and ongoing. No family medical history relevant to the adverse events. Concomitant medication included warfarin taken for maintenance level for history of DVT from Aug2020 and ongoing. The patient experienced DVT in right leg on 02Apr2021, swelling in right leg on 15Mar2021 and discomfort in right leg while walking on 15Mar2021. The patient reported that he had a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and he believes that it was directly related to the COVID-19 vaccine. He reported that he has a history of blood clots in his right leg going back to 2018. He reported that his most recent DVT was in Aug2020 and he was cleared in Nov2020. He reported that he received the COVID-19 vaccine on 10Mar2021. He reported that on 15Mar2021, he started to notice his right leg swelling. He reported that he called his physician on 29Mar2021 and that his physician ordered an ultrasound. He reported that he had the ultrasound on 02Apr2021 and a deep vein thrombosis was found again. Swelling in right leg: he reported that the swelling has gone down. He reported that the reason that he mentioned that he has a history of blood clots was because of his warfarin dosage. He reported that he was first diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis in Jul2018. He reported that he went through that cycle and that his maintenance level of warfarin was maybe 10 or 12 mg of warfarin per day. He reported that he had another deep vein thrombosis in Aug2020, and since Aug2020 he has been on 17 mg of warfarin daily. He reported that the blood level on warfarin maintenance was supposed to be between 2 and 2.5. He reported that now because of the deep vein thrombosis he experienced in Aug2020, his doctor wanted his level to be at 2.5 to 3.5. He stated that he doesn&#39;t think that at that blood level for his warfarin that he should have gotten a blood clot. He reported that something compromised or interfered with the warfarin, resulting in a deep vein thrombosis. Discomfort when walking: he reported that it feels like his leg was compressing. He reported that the discomfort seems to have gotten better. He was queried for details of warfarin prescription. He reported that the 10 or 12 mg warfarin tablets that he had been taking when the blood clot was diagnosed in Aug2020 have been consumed and he no longer has the bottle. He reported that he did not have the bottle with him for his current warfarin prescription. He reported that the warfarin was not auto-refilled by the pharmacy. He reported that the warfarin was only prescribed a week or two at a time. Investigations: he reported that since Aug2020 when the deep vein thrombosis returned, he started doing self INR tests at home. He reported that he constantly self-monitors his INR at home and his levels were consistently at 3.0 to 3.1. He reported that he monitors his INR at least once a week, sometimes twice a week depending on how he feels. He reported that sometimes his INR goes over 4 and he can feel it. He reported that his system was a little off when it feels too high so he knows how to adjust. He reported that he last checked his INR today, 15Apr2021, and that it was 4.0. He reported that he typically checks his INR on Wednesday. He reported that he keeps a log of his INR levels. He reported that he did not see his physician on 29Mar2021, but that he called his physician and his physician wrote a prescription for the caller to get an ultrasound. Vaccination facility type was pharmacy. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room and physician office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He reported that he doesn&#39;t usually get vaccines. BNT162B2 second dose (lot number: ER5729) was administered on an unspecified date; anatomical location: left arm. The outcome of the events was recovering.

I then received a second dose (Lot # EN6206) on 3/13/21.  Over that weekend the pain in my leg grew worse and the leg began to swell. on 3/15, I went to my primary care physician who said it looked like a blood clot. He sent me to a radiologist for an ultrasound (?) of the leg. After confirming the clot, I went to a local ER. They started me on Eliquis to treat the clot

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy; eye sight in that eye is getting worse every day; right eyelid was sticking on his eye and wouldn&#39;t shut; he couldn&#39;t move his face on the left side and he can&#39;t control it at all; blood got really thin and wouldn&#39;t clot; left hand got really swollen; entire arm bruised; edema in his hand; edema in his hand got to the point where his skin was cracking; blood got really thin and wouldn&#39;t clot; face went numb; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 59-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: EN6207, Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (at the age of 59 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lupus from 2020 and ongoing, ongoing High Blood Pressure, Spinal Surgeries from 1999, Chronic Pain,Retention water, blood clot issue. The patient previously had tetanus shot. Concomitant medications included losartan potassium; allopurinol; hydroxychloroquine; methocarbamol; morphine sulfate (MS CONTIN); oxycodone; furosemide.  Caller states he is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine. Seven days later the dose of vaccine (18Mar2021), patient developed Bell&#39;s Palsy which he has never had before and has never had any other problem with. He has seen an ENT, his pain doctor, and his medical doctor and they all say the Covid vaccine has caused the problem he is having. He was told by his ENT this is very possibly permanent. Emergency Doctors are who he went to because he thought he was having a stroke, because half of his face went numb. He has been to the doctor 10 times in the last 7 days, it has not been fun at all. He didn&#39;t put it together until he saw the ENT, who said Bell&#39;s Palsy is caused from a virus. States he had no idea until he said that, that it could possibly be from the injection. States he has never had Bells Palsy before and it started 8 days after the initial shot. His right eyelid was sticking on his eye and wouldn&#39;t shut and he couldn&#39;t move his face on the left side and he can&#39;t control it at all. Clarifies he couldn&#39;t shut his right eye all of the way. Since then they have told him he needs to tape his eye shut for 12 hours a day to keep from going blind. The thing that bothers him is his eye sight in that eye is getting worse every day even though he uses the cream and tapes it shut. His wife told him even with both eyes shut, it will not completely shut because his lower eyelid is hanging down too far. The ENT told him he needs a hearing test today at 2:00p.m. to see if this is going to be a permanent problem. He is getting ready to go to the ear doctor to find out more. At the same time he developed the Bells Palsy, his blood got really thin and wouldn&#39;t clot which seems really weird. Also on 18MAR2021, his left hand got really swollen and the entire arm bruised and they said the edema in his hand got to the point where his skin was cracking because his blood got so thin that it couldn&#39;t clot at all. He had a blood clot issue in the past. States his arm and hand have improved, he can move his hand again finally. The ENT said that since he has been on Prednisone, for recovery for Bells Palsy, for over a week and gotten worse instead of better, it may be permanent. Prednisone is not working, it has actually gotten worse. Prednisone 10mg for 7 days and to decrease by one tablet every day until gone but states he has gotten worse. Treatments (assessed as for all events): Prednisone. States that it has been two weeks since this happened and the doctor told him the only other option is skull surgery. The bones in his head would be drilled out to make room for the nerves in hopes he would be able to work his mouth again, so not a good thing. Eye cream. He is on disability and his house payment is 3/4 of what he makes, so he can&#39;t take care of the medical bills himself otherwise he wouldn&#39;t worry about it. It is very depressing. His medical doctor said he hadn&#39;t seen any cases of Bell&#39;s Palsy for 2 years, and he has seen 4 in the last week so that doesn&#39;t give him a lot of confidence even though he is still encouraging people to get the vaccine because it is safer than not.He has multiple visits to the ER 3 times between 18MAR2021 and 19MAR2021 within 24 hours; states he was in the ER for hours and hours but no admission. States they did a CT Scan, MRI, CT with contrast and then after that ended up 22 saw ENT who confirmed the fact that Covid Vaccine that gave Bells Palsy and on 22-23 saw his GM again. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None within 4 weeks; states 9 months ago he had a Tetanus Shot. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy, Visual acuity decreased, Eyelid disorder, Orofacial dyskinesia, numbness in face was not recovered; other events was recovering. All events happened on 18Mar2021.

                                                Thumb hurt; Hand swelled up; Elbow was swollen; Intense pain in the elbow; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 59-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, at age of 59 years old, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 09:45 (Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure increased from 1995 and ongoing (It is controlled), anxiety (young and suffering from anxiety, has no clue why) and family cancer history. The patient previous received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 19Mar2021 09:45 (Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at age of 59 years old, at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He received the Covid vaccine on 09Apr2021. The following day he later noticed his elbow started bothering him that night, and around midnight it woke him up. He had intense pain in the elbow and tried to tough it out. 4 hours later he was in the ER, it was that bad. When he got there they did an ultrasound and some X-rays. The ultrasound showed his elbow was swollen, and they removed 17cc of fluid. They asked if he had any trauma to his arm and he said absolutely no way. He doesn&#39;t know what to think. He was trying to find someone to help with the issue. On a scale of 1 to 10 the pain was a strong 10. To this day it was still bothering him pretty bad. He coundn&#39;t work because of it. He could hardly straighten it out because it is so sore. It was painful, but not as bad as Saturday(10Apr2021) and Sunday(11Apr2021) morning. On 13Apr2021, his hand swelled up. That&#39;s gone away. His thumb hurt on 14Apr2021 and that had gone away, he just aced that. He put ice on his elbow. His elbow from last night(13Apr2021) to today (14Apr2021) probably had a 30 percent change. It is getting better but it is still sore. He can&#39;t straighten it and he is trying to bend it to work it so it doesn&#39;t get stiff. With the work he does he needs to use his arms. He works in construction. He got the shot on 09Apr2021, and the pain was later in the day. He received his dose around 0945, and at about 1500 to 1530 he noticed his elbow bothering him. Later that night when he went to bed he was uncomfortable and couldn&#39;t sleep. Eventually he did fall asleep and at 0000 he woke up in excruciating pain. He tried to deal with it until 0400 when he went to the ER. His pain is nowhere near what it was. When he tries to straighten it, it is very painful, about a 6. If he bends it back it is much better. If he tries to straighten it the pain level goes up. It is still swelled up a bit. It is hard to say if it has improved, he never really saw it. He went to bed and when he woke up he was in so much pain. He had on his PJs and put on his shoes and left. All he knew was he was in pain. He presumed it was more swollen then, they did the ultrasound and found all that fluid. The pain in his thumb subsided a bit. He took the ice off of it about 30 minutes before this phone call, so about 45 minutes ago. It feels a little better. At least one part of the puzzle is solved. He noticed it at about 0730 this morning. He had an ultrasound on 11Apr2021. He had 3 to 4 X-rays on 11Apr2021. Outcome for events was not recovered. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information expected

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 59-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8732) at the age of 59-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Mar2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. He has no known allergies and has COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, rosuvastatin, oxybutynin, and tamsulosin. There were no other vaccines in four weeks and no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient reported that he was having some wild effects from the vaccine and did not know what to do. On 26Mar2021 at 15:00, he was having neuropathy like effects. His hands, arms, legs, and feet were experiencing pain and burning sensations, they were burning like nerve damage; he also has a little burning sensation in his nose and cheeks. He has never had this before. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. He was also having some weird sensations in his calf muscles, these sensations started within the past week and a half (Apr2021) which prompted physician office visit. The physician placed him on gabapentin 100 mg to start from 12Apr2021, but it was not enough, it was titrated up to 300 mg, three times a day and he is scheduled to see specialist soon. The patient mentioned that this vaccine has ruined his health. He also went to an urgent care center because his leg was bothering him, it was swelling on an unspecified date in 2021; he thought he had a blood clot; they did some kind of test where they looked at the leg and did not find anything. He didn&#39;t have a particular question. He would just like to talk to someone to see if this was going on with anyone else, if it will go away, or if this was permanent problem he will have. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. He received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 13Apr2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The outcome of the events was not recovered.
