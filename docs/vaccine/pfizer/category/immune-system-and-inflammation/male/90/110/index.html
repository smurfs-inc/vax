                                                right leg was pretty large and swollen in one spot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself). A 90-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number EK4176, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm), on 13Jan2021, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization (also reported as take it for the epidemic). Medical history included diabetes. Ongoing concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and insulin detemir (LEVEMIR) both taken for diabetes for about 5 years. The patient stated that he just got the COVID Vaccine on Wednesday, 13Jan2021, and he had the shot in his arm. He informed that he was a diabetic and where he gives his insulin shots, he would have to move to different spots of his body due to getting hard swelling knots. This morning of 15Jan2021, when he got up, he noticed his right leg was pretty large and swollen in one spot. It was on a side where he does give his insulin shots. It was pretty large. He was wondering if this had anything to do with the COVID Vaccine; he clarified that he got the shot in his left arm. The spot was on his right leg and was pretty large and swollen, it was about the size of an egg or a little larger. He added that he does give insulin shots in both his left and his right leg. After so long of giving shots in one spot, he will notice he has been getting hard spots around there. However, this spot was different, it was way larger. Again, the size of an egg. The only difference was the size. No treatment was received for the adverse event reported. The outcome of the event was not recovered.
