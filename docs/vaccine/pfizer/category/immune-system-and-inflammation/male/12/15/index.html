                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

He subsequently developed fever, diarrhea, and vomiting.  The day prior to admission, he developed a diffuse popular rash.  He was seen in clinic on 5/20 and lab work was obtained, which was consistent with MIS-C findings (elevated troponin, elevated fibrinogen, elevated CRP, hyponatremia, relatively low absolute lymphocyte count).

From EHR note: Patient is an otherwise healthy 12yM with recent Lyme disease (erythema migrans) transferred to hospital for hyponatremia, encephalitis, myocarditis. Initially intubated due to aspiration risk, now s/p extubation and stable on RA. Broad workup so far including consultations from neurology, cardiology, immunology, and infectious disease with unclear etiology, s/p MRI and LP with c/f covid-vaccine related myocarditis/encephalitis vs lyme carditis/meningoencephalitis vs less likely MISC vs other. Infectious testing so far negative, patient otherwise has returned to baseline behavior without any current symptoms. He is transferred to general for further workup and evaluation and close monitoring. Diagnosed with Lyme 19 days prior to admission,  treated with amoxicillin; p/w headache, fever and vomiting so concern for encephalitis as above vs inflammatory process post-COVID or vaccine. Less likely meningitis given reassuring initial CSF studies. Negative COVID antibody.  Resolving hyponatremia, thought to be likely SIADH. Given presentation and maternal history of albinism with immunodeficiency, broad workup sent. Also with c/f possible inflammatory response/MISC-C vs vaccine myocarditis.

                                                Patient is a previously healthy fully-vaccinated 12 yo presenting with fever and chest pain. He had fevers to 101-102 6/17-6/19 that were responsive to antipyretics, then the chest pain started 6/20 and has been constant 5/10 pain since. It is burning and located substernal/between the scapula. Activity/breathing doesn&#39;t worsen the pain, but it is worst at night. He also reports a mild headache today that has since resolved. He went to his PCP today and had an EKG concerning for diffuse precordial ST elevations, so he was referred to the ED with concern for myo/pericarditis.   Of note, Patient received a second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 6/11.  He also travels every week and has removed ticks from himself that were unattached.  No known bites and no rashes.  He has not had any n/v/d, no abdominal pain, no cough/congestion/rhinorrhea, no syncope, no palpitations.   In the ED, he was well-appearing but tachycardic to the 120s with otherwise normal vitals. He developed fever to Tmax 38.3 that improved with Motrin. On exam he had rash concerning for erythema migrans with multiple satellite lesions. He an EKG with ST elevations in the inferolateral leads. POC US did not show any pericardial effusion. Cardiology was consulted (see consult note) and recommended troponin, which was 1.08, and CRP, which was 7.52.  CXR showed clear lungs and normal cardiac contours.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted for further workup and management of his perimyocarditis. Given his erythema migrans rash and positive history of recent multiple tick exposure, we were concerned about Lyme disease (Lyme antibody pending) and sent testing for co-infection (Anaplasma, Ehrlichiosis) with smear negative for Babesia. We treated him empirically with doxycycline (given antibiotic allergies) and his rash improved. We also considered myocarditis following COVID vaccination. He had serial EKG&#39;s done which showed low-normal function, with EF=55.2%. He had serial troponins sent and they were downtrending at the time of discharge. He had chest pain that improved with PRN ibuprofen. He did not require steroids or IVIG. Cardiac MRI was completed prior to discharge and showed normal function and an area of subepicardial LV myocardial late gadolinium enhancement. consistent with myocarditis. At the time of discharge, he had no chest pain, was eating and drinking normally, and family was in agreement with plan for close Cardiology and Infectious Disease follow-up.

He was able to sleep but had chest pain the following morning that improved after he vomited. The chest pain is midsternal and feels pressure-like. It lasted a few hours. He swam on 7/12 without problems (at a swim club) for an hour. He had his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday 7/10/21. There has not been any fevers. Elevated troponin and CRP with recent COVID-19 vaccine, suspicious for post-vaccine myocarditis. He is hemodynamically stable with normal vitals and no evidence of ventricular ectopy or depressed left ventricular function. His troponin peaked at 11.05 and trended down, but his most recent value is slightly up at 8.2 from 7.6. Recommended continuing to trend the troponins for now (if they show a downward trend then twice daily is adequate, unless he develops chest pain). At this time, IVIG is held unless he becomes unstable or  the troponins trend upward .

                                                My son experienced under his left arm he had swelling of lymph nodes, on the middle of his armpit. The next day it was bigger and it was tender to touch, very painful. He also had some swollen lymph nodes on his neck, left side, near the collar bone and side of his ear. His lymph nodes got bigger on Saturday, the one on his left arm was getting smaller and the one on his neck today is going down in size as well.  My son was by a nurse practitioner, and she said that my son did not have any fever, he said it was consistent with the vaccine he received.   To this day his lymph nodes are still present but getting smaller in size.

He was seen by cardiology and infectious disease. He showed improvement with nothing more than NSAIDs, and since his MRI was normal, he was not given IVIG.

Later in the day he felt a lump in his armpit (I am assuming lymph node).  It hurt to touch the lump and hurt any time he moved his arm.  Pain continued today, June 10th, and the lump under his arm is quite big at around 1.5 inches.  It is squishy to touch.  Painful to touch or move arm all day today as well.

                                                Patient received vaccine and stayed in pharmacy building for 15 minutes.  Around that time patient&#39;s parents came back up to pharmacy to notify staff that he had broken out into a rash in the back and his hands felt swollen.  I asked if he had any trouble breathing and parents stated no.  We followed the Adverse Event Action Plan.  We called 911.  Patient&#39;s parents then stated son is starting to have some breathing issue.  I came out with EpiPen and was going to administer when mom stated son&#39;s symptoms has resolved greatly and she did not want me to administer EpiPen.  Shortly after EMS arrived and evaluated patient and took him to hospital for observation.

He received his 2nd Pfizer Covid vaccine on 6/12 and began having symptoms the next night. He began taking ibuprofen for headache and fever. His symptoms worsened through the day until he had vomiting. He was saying strange things and behaving oddly. He became very hot and agitated at home, prompting mom to bring him into an outside hospital ED.  There, rectal temperature was 106F and he was noted to be combative.  A CMP was obtained, which was mostly normal. CT of his head was obtained, during which he had an episode of left upper extremity shaking concerning for seizure. He was reportedly alert throughout.   Patient is a 13 yo M with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presents with 1 day of fever, headache, altered mental status, vomiting, found to have cerebral edema and elevated CRP. There is no acidosis, elevated lactate, or metabolic derangement, and utox is neg. The etiology could be related to the vaccine. Ingestions are also possible given the high fever and altered mental status - particularly serotonin syndrome. Infectious etiologies are also possible given the fever.

The very next day, June 16, 2021 her son lifted his shirt to show her the area he felt was swollen to which she saw excessive swelling on his axila, arm and breast area on the side of the injection site. She took him to see his primary physician who prescribed ibuprofen, a Medrol dose pak and an epipen. Her son is at home being monitored. He was started on the ibuprofen to some relief. She is waiting to begin the dose pak until tomorrow morning 06/16/21.

He has not used his inhaler for over a year. The next day he had hives were much worse and his fever was going up. The hives were worse on his left arm and his arm was red around the vaccination site. He also had swelling in his face and he was having a little trouble breathing. I gave him Benadryl and Zyrtec which helped as well as Pepcid. The breathing difficulty subsided after that. He got a different rash on his back that was different from the original hives. We continued the medications and he was still Febrile until the sixth day. The sore throat is still present after nine days but the fever and hives are gone.

                                                On the night of the vaccine, patient developed fever (Tmax 104), chills, and myalgias. He had an outbreak of herpes on his shoulder.  Continued to feel very fatigued. Three days after the vaccine, he started having chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion. He continued to be fatigued. Chest pain was intermittent. Saw pediatric cardiologist at outpatient appointment on 6/15/21 where he had a normal EKG and ECHO.  High sensitivity troponin on 6/15/21 was 0.08. He had a Holter monitor placed. He was asked to do activity while wearing Holter monitor and self-limit based on symptoms. He played basketball that night and had to press the Holter button 8 times while playing when he was experiencing chest pain. When he got home from practice, he felt weak and dizzy with associated chest pain. Mom notes his nails were blue/purple, and he was &#34;lethargic&#34; . Symptoms improved with ibuprofen. Patient did not want to  do usual activity, mom called cardiology who recommended going to ED. Patient has not had chest pain since coming home from practice on 6/15/21.  He was admitted to hospital on 6/16/21. Repeat high sensitivity troponin was 0.82 on 6/16/21 and repeated on 6/17/21 was 0.41. Cardiology consulted. Cardiac MRI performed with normal results. He was dizzy on 6/17/21 when he got up to use the restroom, self-resolved. Cardiology evaluated him and cleared him for discharge with outpatient follow-up and self-limitation with activity.

A 13-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0167, expiry date: Aug2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 13May2021 at 12:15, as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and other allergies compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity were none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no family medical history relevant to AE. The patient received no other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. On 13Jan2021 at 20:00, 8 hours after getting the shot, the patient experienced tonsils started hurting. He didn&#39;t feel well and had headaches. On 14Jan2021, he had some pretty bad symptoms on Saturday morning, he woke up with herpes zoster on his lips and his mother called to pediatrician and he was very dismissive about it and said that if the body was under stress it can come out, but he never had anything like this before. It looks like little pustules around his mouth and looks like when my mom had shingles. He did mention his arm hurt a little but went to soccer practice. Clarifies the herpes zoster didn&#39;t show up until Saturday evening/night and it was starting to go away. She took son to get Covid PCR testing on 14Jan2021 and it was negative and was told that the herpes zoster was probably a reaction to the vaccine. The patient received treatment with Abreva. The outcome of the events Since the first dose he woke up with what mother states is herpes zoster on his lips was not recovered, and the other event feeling horrible was unknown, and all other events was recovering.   PSCC Communication: PC Filed Product Complaint: Yes, Description of Product Complaint: Description of complaint: Asks if this could be a bad one since he was so sick and took him to get Covid PCR testing and it was negative. Thought was weird since she and her husband both had the Pfizer Covid shot and did not have any reactions. This was son&#39;s first Covid vaccine, Lot number: EW0167, expiry.

                                                On 6/11, he developed chest pain which began upon awakening.  During his evaluation in the ER that day, he was noted to have an elevated troponin level of 7.524, slightly elevated CRP level, normal D-dimer level, and otherwise, relatively unremarkable CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel.  A chest x-ray was described to be unremarkable. Echocardiogram revealed normal structure and function.   He was admitted and troponins were trended until 6/15. Therapy was initiated with Ketorolac every 6 hours.  Repeat troponin on 6/12 increased to 8.4, echo continued to be normal. Repeat troponin on 6/13 was 10.878. Troponin on 6/14 was 0.670 with continued normal EKG and Echo. On day of discharge, troponin had decreased to 0.110. Throughout admission, patient was monitored on telemetry and he remained in sinus rhythm without ectopy.  The day prior to discharge he was switched to Naproxen BID and will continued to be monitored closely for normalization of his troponin.

A few hours later after completing his morning therapies he showered and went to take a nap. At this time he was febrile to 103.6.  At 1600 he had seizure-like activity with trunk and upper extremity shaking as well as eyes rolling back and drooling.  Parents put him in car and transported him to an outside hospital. He did stop seizing prior to getting to that hospital.  Parents reported seizure lasted approximately 15 minutes with no loss of bowel or bladder control.  By time he arrived at local emergency room he was back at his neurological baseline. At the outside hospital our PICU was consulted and he was given ceftriaxone and vancomycin in meningitic dosing.

The next morning, his face were more swollen and rash in hands were very itchy. We gave him some Benadryl. On Friday his eye was shut closed. I took him to the urgent care and they gave him a steroid shot and prescribed steroids and Pepcid for the itchiness.  They gave him a Kenalog injection, Medrol 4mg therapy pack and 5 tablets of Pepcid at the urgent care.  As of today, he still has some rash to his hands but his face is not swollen.

                                                13 year old who received his second Pfizer COVID vaccine on July 3, 2021 (3 days ago). He describes a low grade fever on the day after the vaccine which did not initially concern him.  He presented to the ER yesterday with complaints of midsternal chest pain and shortness of breath and a vague history of palpitations that started yesterday morning and continued to progress over the day.  The chest pain did not vary with position and was not aggravated with respiratory effort.   He had an elevated troponin and CRP and was admitted for management/observation. His chest pain has resolved since starting Ibuprofen (600 mg q 6 hours).  Serial troponins peaked at 22.9, now trending downward. Notable changes on serial EKG&#39;s with resolving ST segment elevation and T wave inversion. The echocardiogram showed low normal LV function but was otherwise normal.   PT presentation is consistent with the newly recognized post Covid vaccine myocarditis in adolescent males.  Timing of the chest pain in relation to the vaccine, EKG and echo findings and elevated troponins all support the presumed diagnosis of myocarditis.  He met the criteria for a cardiac MRI to be obtained prior to discharge- results pending.

                                                Patient received 1st dose Pfizer COVID vaccine at a store/pharmacy on 5/25/21.  Presented to ED with chest pain on 5/28.  Diagnosed with myocarditis and admitted to the hospital.  ED attending note:  Patient presents with acute onset of chest discomfort in the sternal area 2 days after the first dose of Covid vaccine.  Patient&#39;s not had any fevers.  No respiratory symptoms.  No difficulty with respirations or any pleuritic chest pain.  Denies any cough.  No chest wall trauma.  No back pain.  No palpitations or syncope.  No orthostasis.  No peripheral edema.  On physical exam he was mildly tachycardic in the 80s to low 90s with no murmur and no gallop.  No JVD.  Clear lungs.  No rub.  Bedside ultrasound performed by HCP had bilateral lung sliding and normal gross function based on 2 views.  No pericardial effusion.  EKG had ST changes.  Chest x-ray was obtained without any effusions or pulmonary infiltrates.  Normal cardiac silhouette.  Troponin sent elevated.  Cardiology consulted for possible postvaccination myocarditis.  Child remained stable.  Resting heart rates in the 70s and low 80s.  Cardiology came to see the patient.  Plan to admit to cardiology service.  Presumed diagnosis of myocarditis.   Cardiology admitting note:  Pt. is an otherwise healthy 14yM who presents with acute onset atraumatic chest pain i/s/o recent covid vaccine, found to have mildly elevated inflammatory markers and troponin with borderline ST changes on EKG most consistent with mild peri/myocarditis at this time given overall well appearance on exam without hemodynamic or respiratory compromise and grossly normal function on POCUS, though plan for formal echo in AM. EKG w/ non-specific ST-T wave changes in precordial leads, no evidence of strain or block. Admitted to the cardiology service for serial troponins, ECHO, and close monitoring.  HPI per cardiology consult note:  &#34;Patient is a healthy 14 year old with a history of alopecia who presented to the ED with mild chest pain 4 days following his first Covid vaccine (Pfizer). He had no symptoms in the days immediately following vaccine, and played basketball the day following with no symptoms, but after waking up today began having dull mid sternal chest pain. It was a 4/10, worse with lying down, non pleuritic, not sharp, and not radiating pain and not associated with any other symptoms including SOB, numbness, GI pain, cough, or anything else. Has not taken any meds for the pain. Has not exercised today. Felt &#34;warm&#34; this AM, but didn&#39;t check temperature and felt better throughout the day. No palpitations, dizziness. Denies ever having chest pain before and no recent illnesses or sick contacts. No notable fhx of cardiac disease. In the ED, troponin mildly elevated to 0.12 ng/mL and CRP 5 with low ESR and BNP. Bedside point-of-care US reportedly showed no clear effusion with grossly normal function. HR mainly in 70s in ED and normotensive. EKG with borderline nonspecific ST elevation in V3-V6.&#34;

A 14-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left in May2021 at 10:45 AM (Batch/Lot Number: ER8736) (at age of the 14-year-old) as 1st dose, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included precocious puberty, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and the patient had known allergy to animal: Pet dander. The patient received methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA), guanfacine (GUANFACINE), vitamin c [ascorbic acid], melatonin within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks and prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.  In May2021, the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes (mild swelling) in left armpit. The patient did not receive any treatment of the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

After a little while, he got up and was able to take some Tylenol and attend his video school day with frequent breaks. In afternoon, he started to feel worse. 102. 6 fever - we called Tele-doc appt. His throat was sore and he had some chest pain. The doctor recommended that we go to ER to have him fully evaluated. Pain and fever got better with the Tylenol. He took another couple of dose. Next morning, he had a lot better but continued to have a low fever 100.2 - on and off that day. His lymph nodes under his left arm were quite swollen and painful. The fever did not continue yesterday but the swelling has and the pain has. He was very light-headed and brain fogged on Sunday and Monday. Seems to be better today - the lymph nodes have gone down a lot but are still swollen today. He is  in process of recovering.

Pain is central, to the right of the sternum, without radiation. The pain then became more dull, aching, and has been interfering with his sleep. It does seem to be worse when he is thinking about it, better when he is distracted. He went to basketball tryouts 6/15 and the pain has been more frequent since that episode of strenuous exercise. He has not taken anything for the pain. He also notes more frequent fatigue. He denies any prior covid infection. No recent illness or sick contacts. Denies cough, fever, GI upset, diarrhea. He is going to school in-person, they all wear masks.

                                                3 lymph nodes on collar bone; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother).   A 14-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0164), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26May2021 around 5pm (at the age of 14 years old) as 1st dose, single dose, dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 16Jun2021 around 5:30pm as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No patient history. Patient medical history: None. Family medical history relevant to adverse event was father got sick on second dose of vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Relevant Tests: None. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. No other products. The reporter stated that the patient got vaccine on 26May2021. On 04Jun2021, they noticed lymph nodes on his collar bone. They went to the pediatrician because he had never been sick or anything. After the first dose, he had labs taken and they were perfect. Nothing showed inflammation and nothing was elevated at all. The sedimentation rate was fine. There was nothing. His labs were good, and the X-ray was good. The reporter and her husband did a lot of research and thought that it was the vaccine. The pediatrician did not think that it was the vaccine. There were no cases of teenagers or men getting swollen lymph nodes, only adult women. Now, they want to do surgery on him. One pediatrician wanted to do surgery and the other said to let it wait out. The reporter stated that nobody had heard of any cases of this and asked had anyone else reported lymph nodes on teenagers. The reporter stated that she just got the second shot yesterday on 16Jun2021, so she was not letting him do anything. She was making him sit down all day. The reporter stated that she contacted Pfizer yesterday after she saw the surgeon. She did not know how to contact them. So, she sent an email asking for cases. She confirmed that she did not go through a report she just sent an email. The reporter would just like to know if anyone else, any other teenage boys had this issue. She clarified that he had 3 lymph nodes on his collar bone. She remembered exactly when it was because she freaked out. It was 04Jun2021, at 9:30 at night. He came into the living room, saying he had these knots on his neck. The reporter stated that it was different then mosquito bites because they did not itch. 2 of the lymph nodes had stayed the same and one had gotten harder and was getting firm. Treatment was started on antibiotics yesterday, that the surgeon wanted him on. It was Cephalexin 500mg, twice a day. The adverse event did not require a visit to emergency room because she thought it was the vaccine so she just took him to the pediatrician, and he could not find any reports of it. The adverse event required a visit to physician office, since getting the vaccine, he had gone to the pediatrician, and then to saw the surgeon. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Labs: good, red blood cell sedimentation rate: fine, x-ray: good. The clinical outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                Patient is a previously healthy 15 year-old presenting with chest pain and elevated troponin in the setting of recently receiving his second COVID vaccine.   He was in his USOH and received his second COVID vaccine 6/17. He subsequently experienced tactile fevers, headache, and malaise for two days that resolved. Then 6/21 he developed congestion and chest pain. It is in the center of his chest, not pleuritic but worsened with sneezing/coughing. Tylenol/Motrin help, but given persistence of the pain he presented to the hospital ED.   Lyme titers were sent, troponin at 1814 was 2.12, then at 1646 2.49 (normal &lt;0.06), chem was normal, CBC had wbc 11.5 with 66% neut and Hgb 12.3. EKG and CXR were reportedly normal. He received Tylenol and Ativan and was transferred for further management.   In the ED, he was afebrile with normal VS. Repeat troponin was 0.25. EKG was normal. Given elevated troponin, he is being admitted for further workup and serial cardiac enzymes and EKG.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for troponin and chest pain monitoring. His troponin levels were trended x4 and showed return to normal. Just prior to discharge, troponin level was 0.04 (normal &lt; 0.09). His EKG was normal throughout, and at discharge showed normal sinus rhythm. He did not have any chest pain prior to leaving the hospital. On discharge, he was tolerating a normal diet. Plan for return was discussed with family for cardiac MR on 6/25. Return precautions were discussed and family expressed understanding.

                                                Patient reports onset of chest pain three days after his second Pfizer COVID vaccine. In the following three days after his vaccine, he had headache, decreased appetite, and mild nausea. However was still taking in fluids, decreased solid food intake. He also experienced insomnia and generalized malaise. At midnight on 07/02 he began to experience 9/10 substernal chest pain that was sharp, burning in sensation and located in the middle of the chest, non-radiating, pleuritic which lasted for several hours. Patient has had no fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, congestion, sore throat or cough. Denies any  SOB, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, edema, orthopnea. There has been no trauma to the chest. No recent URIs. He was seen at a hospital where he was found to have a trop of 1251 ng/L (converting to ~1.5 in our system) then one hour later up to 1500mg/L. His EKG at the hospital demonstrated lateral ST elevations. Had a normal CXR. He was given Maalox which was not helpful. He was transferred to another medical facility after 3 hours at the hospital.   Upon presentation to the emergency department, his vitals were stable. He had elevated CRP to 7.69, troponin was 1.0. CBC and Chem were normal. BNP normal at 15. Bedside ultrasound showed no pericardial effusion. Cardiology was consulted and ECHO showed mild left ventricular dysfunction with EF 47%. Repeat EKG here showed ongoing ST elevations in lateral leads, though mild. His pain has since improved to a 2/10. He has not required any medication for his pain. He is COVID/flu/RSV negative.   On arrival to the floor, his chest pain had completely resolved. Patient reports the pain was pleuritic, worse with exertion and improving on rest.   PMH: idiopathic urticaria  Allergies: NKDA  Family history: none reported, no cardiac disease or sudden cardiac death  Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV x 2 doses. He initially had some very mild chest discomfort that improved by day 2 of admission. An echocardiogram was performed which showed improvement in his EF to 54%. Given his dysfunction, he was started on Enalapril 2.5mg twice daily. He was transitioned over to PO steroids which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were trending down, and EKG was WNL. Cardiac MRI was performed and showed late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. He had occasional PVCs but no arrhythmias. Viral myocarditis studies were sent and all negative.  By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Patient will follow up in cardiology clinic next week with a repeat MRI 3-6 months.

                                                My 15-year-old son received dose #2 of Pfizer?s Covid-19 vaccine at 10:30am on 6/6/21. At 1:00am on 6/8/21 he was struggling to breathe due to pain in the center of his chest upon inhalation. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before. His chest pain was worse lying down and he could not lie down or sleep and wanted to stay standing on his feet. He felt pain in both forearms too. He was crying from the pain and the difficulty of breathing, and was very tired but unable to recline in order to sleep. I called the advice nurse, who checked with the doctor on call at his pediatrician?s office, and she told us to go to the ER due to concern it may be myocarditis or pericarditis.

                                                The patient is a 15-year-old male with no past medical history who was in his normal state of health when he received a dose to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on June 10th 2021. The day following vaccine he developed fevers and chills which she treated with Tylenol.  On the morning of June 12 he developed chest pain and nausea which progressively worsened throughout the day.  That day he presented to an outside hospital emergency department where he was found to have elevated troponin and EKG with ST segment elevation.  He was then transferred to the hospital pediatric ICU for further care.  On admission to the PICU treatment was started with IV Toradol.  Echocardiogram was performed and revealed mildly decreased left ventricular systolic function.  His peak troponin level was 27.43.  He remains hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the pediatric floor.  By 6/14/2021 his chest pain had resolved and he continued to improve with NSAID therapy alone.  His troponin down trended to 2.62 on day of discharge.  Repeat echo on day of discharge showed improving but still mildly diminished systolic function.  Repeat ECG at discharge showed persistent ST elevation. He was discharged with a prescription to continue ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times daily and follow-up with pediatric cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks.

                                                Patient is a healthy 15 year old male presenting with chest pain in the setting of recent SARS-CoV2 vaccination. He was in his usual state of health until he received the second dose of the Pfizer/BNT SARS-CoV2 vaccination on Thursday 6/10. Shortly after and into the following day, he developed fatigue, chills, and a headache, which resolved within 24 hours. However, early this morning at around 2am, he awoke with sharp central chest pain associated with some shortness of breath, radiating to his left, prompting him to present to the ED.  Initially presented to Hospital ED. Vitals stable. Labs notable for troponin 0.07 and d-dimer 1.48. EKG with sinus rhythm, ST elevation in inferior leads. Given ibuprofen 600mg and contacted Cardiology, who recommended transfer to another ED for echocardiogram and further evaluation.  Here in the ED, vital stable, exam non-focal. Labs notable for troponin 0.13 and CRP 3.0; CBC, chem 10, LFTs, BNP, all within normal limits. CXR normal. Echo done which showed normal function (prelim read). Seen by ID who recommended standard workup for vaccine-induced myocarditis. He was admitted to the floor in stable condition.  Hospital Course: Due to rising troponin during hospital day 1 (peak 0.23), patient was treated with IVIG 2 g/kg (6/14) and methylprednisone 30 mg BID (6/14 - 6/15). On 6/15 a cardiac MRI was obtained that showed a small area of late gadolinium enhancement of the LV with normal function.  Troponin was trended every 12 hours and had decreased to 0.11 on 6/15 AM. He was transitioned to oral prednisone 30 mg BID to complete a total steroid course of 5 days (6/14 - 6/18). During admission he was found to be EBV PCR positive with all other viral testing including EBV serologies pending. It is still thought this is likely due to post-vaccine inflammation and not viral myocarditis but serologies should be followed up as outpatient.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.   Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  Prednisone for myocarditis  Famotidine for stomach protection while on prednisone  Discharged home with follow up tests scheduled for 6/17/21.

                                                My son developed neck soreness and and an enlarged lymph node that weekend.  On Monday following the vaccination a severe headache started which lasted 4 days, even with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Tuesday, he started complaining about not remembering what he did the day before when he woke up in the morning..memory started coming back around noon. The memory issues lasted one week and began to dissipate thankfully.  After a few weeks got a call to schedule his second shot.  Called the pediatrician and the pediatrician told us not to administer the second vaccine due to adverse reaction to the first.   We are monitoring his memory issues..he is almost a straight A student in school last year and on an Advanced Learning Plan in high school due to high IQ. We will know if this is long lasting after attending school and monitoring his grades and headaches in the fall.

A 15-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0178), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (at the age of 15 year old) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took dose 1 of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization and no reaction on previous exposure to vaccine. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced marble sized lump above clavicle and lump right above his collar bone from on the same arm that he had the vaccine. Seriousness of the event was provided as unspecified. NDC and UPC number was unknown. It was reported that the patient (reporter&#39;s son) has received his second vaccine of the Pfizer COVID dose on Tuesday and he has since developed a marble sized lump above his clavicle and right above his collar bone from on the same arm that he had the vaccine and reporter was wondering if that was normal and if there was anything that she should do for it. Reporter informed that she is going to call the number and take care of her son first unless Medical information department away to connect her there faster. Outcome of the events were unknown.  Follow-up attempts are possible. Information about batch no/lot no has been requested.

                                                Patient received second COVID vaccine on 6/4.  Chest pain developed on 6/6.  He presented to hospital where EKG showed ST segment changes and troponin was elevated.  he was transferred to our facility.  In our emergency department his EKG was abnormal.  His troponin was elevated, along with CRP, AST, and ALT.  An echocardiogram on 6/7 showed moderately depressed LV systolic function (EF = 34%).  He was admitted to the pediatric cardiology service.  His picture was felt to be consistent with myopericarditis.  During admission, he was treated with NSAIDs and lisinopril was initiated.  Repeated echo on 6/9 showed normal LV systolic function.  he was discharged home on 6/9 on ibuprofen and lisinopril with plan for pediatric cardiology follow up in 4-6 weeks.  Given proximity of patient&#39;s onset of symptoms to the second Pfizer vaccine, and given similar cases reported in the literature, the chief concern is whether this patient&#39;s symptoms were related to the second Pfizer COVID vaccine.  Please note, I did not care for this patient, but am reporting this case on behalf of the attending physician who cared for this patient while he was hospitalized.

                                                15 yo male with myocarditis following 2nd dose of pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  He reports that he received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 6/16/21. In the 1-2 days following the vaccine he experienced fatigue, body aches, and fever to Tmax 101F. Family treated this with anti-pyretics. On 6/18 he started having a pain in his left chest. He was again febrile at that time. On the day of admission his chest pain was worse and he was experiencing pain all over his body.   He was noted to be tachycardic in the ED. His initial labs showed a modestly elevated BNP to 593 with a markedly elevated troponin to 1233. CRP was mildly elevated at 3.8. Electrolytes were unremarkable as were LFTs. CBC w/ diff showed an absolute lymphopenia with ALC of 1000 but was otherwise unremarkable. D-Dimer was normal. He was admitted initially to hospital medicine and then was transferred to the ICU due to concern for risk of developing a cardiac arrhythmia. An echocardiogram done showed trace mitral regurgitation but was otherwise normal with normal LV function. CXR was fairly unremarkable. Coags are normal. Repeat electrolytes showed a slight bump in his creatinine. LFTs largely unchaged and procalcitonin of 0.16.    He does have a past medical history of PCR proven COVID-19 disease in December 2020.

                                                Pt is a 15 y.o. with a history of chest pain here today for evaluation. He is an ex 29 weeker with no long term consequences of prematurity.     Pt has been in his usual state of health until he developed intermittent chest pain x a few weeks. Pt had a URI for which he wasn&#39;t sure if it was allergies or a cold in April 2021.  He did receive Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine (First dose 5/16/21 and 2nd dose 6/6/21). Pt came to cardiology for echo for chest pain on 6/22/21. Echo showed pericardial effusion. Pt feel that he had chest pain before the vaccine, but Mom feels like it may have no started until after the first vaccine. Pt is quite active in basketball without issues. The pain lasts for a few minutes and is on his left side radiating down. He did notice that the pain worsened in certain positions, especially while lying down. There is no history of syncope, dyspnea, cyanosis, or heart palpitations. On 6/29, Pt was still having intermittent chest pain.

                                                15 yo M with no PMH p/w 1 day of chest pain and elevated troponin and lateral ST segment elevations.  On Wednesday 6/30 he had his second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. There after he had headache, tactile fever, fatigue and myalgias which resolved by Friday 7/2. On Friday at midnight, he awoke with 7/10 sharp substernal chest pain, non radiating. No recent trauma to the chest. He took Tylenol at home which did not relieve the pain.  No recent URI sx over the last month. The last time he remembers having URI sx was 1.5 years ago. He does endorse &#34;one or two sneezes&#34; over the past month, which he attributes to allergies.  Today 7/3, he presented to urgent care center where he got an EKG, which was concerning for ST elevations. He was given ASA which did not relieve the pain. He was sent to hospital for further work up where he had a Troponin to 1.59, CRP to 36, AST to 79, ALT to 64, Alkphos to 74, BNP to 119, ESR to 10, and WBC to 13.4.  EKG showed ST elevation in I, II, precordial leads V4 V5 V6. CXR wnl. He was given IV toradol at hospital, which alleviated his CP. He was transferred to ED for further evaluation.  On arrival to the ED on 7/3, he was HDS afebrile, with BP 111/69, HR of 80, and satting 100% on RA. His CP had resolved to a level of 0/10. Additional labs were obtained including repeat CBC (with WBC 10K, Hgb of 14), normal ESR of 20, normal D-dimer of less than 0.27, BMP wnl, elevated LFTs with AST 103, ALT of 61, elevated LDH to 293, normal GGT and alk phos, normal BNP to 28, elevated CRP to 3, and an extremely elevated troponin of 3.15. NP swab for COID, Influenza A/B, and RSV were negative. CXR wnl but did note findings consistent with degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV x 8 doses. His chest discomfort improved by day 2 of admission. An echocardiogram was performed which did not show any cardiac dysfunction. His troponin downtrended while on IV steroids, therefore he was transitioned over to PO steroids which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were continuing to trend down, and EKG was WNL. Cardiac MRI was performed and showed late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. He had occasional NSVTs/PVCs; he was started on Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily to prevent arrhythmias after discharge. He was discharged home with a Holter monitor to be worn for 4 days. Viral myocarditis studies were sent and all negative.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Patient will follow up in cardiology clinic next week with a repeat MRI 3-6 months.   Of note, CXR from 7/3 with incidental findings suspicious for degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine. This should be followed  by his primary care physician as an out patient.   Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  - Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily (for prevention of NSVT)  - Prednisone 30mg BID (myocarditis)  - Famotidine 20mg daily (while on steroids)  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued equipment: NA   Relevant Diagnostic Images/Studies:  Cardiac MRI (7/7): ? Normal biventricular size and systolic function. ? No regional wall motion abnormalities. ? Suggestion of increased T2 signal intensity/edema. ? Positive myocardial late gadolinium enhancement without functional correlate. ? No significant valvular dysfunction. ? No coronary artery aneurysms. ? Small pericardial effusion.  Echocardiogram (7/3): ? Normal valvular function. ? Normal left ventricular size and systolic function. ? Normal diastolic function indices. ? Reduced longitudinal strain with normal circumferential strain. ? Normal appearing proximal coronary arteries. ? Qualitatively normal right ventricular systolic function. ?

                                                Patient admitted fur to chest pain and dyspnea and found to have myopericarditis after 2nd dose of COVID-19 Pzifer vaccine. Vaccine was administered at pharmacy.  First dose received on 5/15/2021, second dose on 6/5/2021. Fatigue and chills started a few hours after second dose and then developed shortness of breath, nausea, emesis and 8/10 midsternal chest pain. Presented to an urgent care facility where CXR and EKG were obtained. EKG showed early repolarizations. Labs were obtained at a local ED and showed elevated troponins, initially 11k and then to 20k and peaked there. BNP was within normal limits. Subsequent EKG showed diffuse ST-segment elevations concerning for acute pericarditis. No prior infections or symptoms like this previously. He was given colchicine at outside facility prior to transfer. At hospital he was continued on ibuprofen and monitored with telemetry and had ECHO and cardiac MRI. Latter was consistent with myopericarditis. ECHO showed normal function. He received PPI while on NSAIDs. His symptoms resolved and he was discharged to home on 6/10/2021 with activity restrictions and plan to follow-up with peds cardiology. Of note, there was an error submitting the initial VAERS report for this patient during the admission, therefore, this delayed report is being submitted.

                                                Patient presented to the ED with 10/10 chest pain.  Two days prior, he&#39;d gotten his second COVID-19 pfizer vaccine.  He denied any fever, congestion, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, or other signs of infection recently; no sick contacts.  On arrival to the ED, he had normal vital signs,  but physical exam was notable for sternal/epigastric pain. Laboratory evaluation, including CBC, CMP, CRP, urinalysis, urine culture, high sensitivity troponins, and lipase were obtained and notable for HS troponin of 303 pg/mL with a 2 hour repeat of 291 pg/mL. CRP was 3.5 mg/dL. His EKG had diffuse ST elevations. CXR was obtained with no evidence of cardiac border or consolidation. RUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of cholecystitis or other abnormality. Patient was admitted for presumed COVID-19  vaccine-induced myopericarditis. Echocardiogram showed  normal biventricular function and no pericardial infusion. He was treated with IV toradol, with resolution of chest pain. HS troponins reached the 400s, with downtrend to the 300s prior to discharge. He was discharged on PO ibuprofen with follow-up  cardiac MRI and labs.

                                                On June 2, 2021, he awoke and complained of feeling hot, tired, and not hungry. His mother had been sick with acute gastroenteritis symptoms 2 days earlier. Over the course of the day, he had a fever to 101.6 F, and began to have loose stools (twice). He received Ibuprofen 400 mg by mouth every 6 hours for the fever, and drank plenty of fluids. On June 3, 2021, he continued to have fevers to 101.5 F, loose stools (twice again), and poor oral intake of food. I canceled his scheduled 2nd Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and got him a NP swab test for SARS-CoV-2 through the health department. On June 4, 2021, he had no fever but now complained of a rubbing left parasternal chest pain. On physical examination, his BP was elevated (130s/90s), he had a slight tachycardia (90s), and was afebrile. On auscultation, I heard a S4 gallop and took him immediately to the local ER.

Labwork done  at that time showed modest nonspecific elevations of inflammatory markers CRP of 42,  (normal &lt; 8), ESR 50, calprotectin 285 (120 limit).  SARS covid-19 antibody semiquant to spike protein RBD was 64.4 U/mL (&lt;0.8, Labcorp).  Other tests did not identify another specific etiology, and an evaluation by another physician for myocarditis was reportedly normal.  As of 7/17 he feels better with a resolution of all symptoms, labwork repeated this past week (7/15) showed a resolution of those same inflammatory markers to normal levels .

                                                Patient had flu like symptoms that developed the evening of vaccination including fever, headache, myalgias, nausea and vomiting. He had a syncopal episode on 7/18 (2 days after vaccination) and family found him on the ground.  Following this episode he complained of substernal pleuritic chest pain. Initial EKG demonstrated diffuse ST changes. He became hypotensive and developed respiratory distress with evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR. He was admitted to the PICU on 35L HFNC and received an epinephrine drip for blood pressure control. Respiratory status improved.

                                                The patient had COVID-19 in July 2020. In August 2020, he developed a whole body pustular rash. He was then admitted for an &#34;asthma exacerbation&#34; and found to have hilar lymphadenopathy. He was treated with several courses of prednisone for his asthma during the next few months. Within few days of his first dose of the COVID19 vaccine he developed fever and severe exacerbation of his rash (which thought to be acne at that time) that resulted in hospitalization on 6/7/2021. Interestingly, he received his second dose of the meningococcal vaccine (MCV4P, Menactra, lot # U6877BA) on 6/7/2021. The patient has been treated with antimicrobials (both antibiotics and antivirals, completed course) and high-dose corticosteroids (both oral and IV) and is slowly improving. He has severe skin scarring.
