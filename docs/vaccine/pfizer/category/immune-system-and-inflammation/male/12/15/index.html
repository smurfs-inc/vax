                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

He subsequently developed fever, diarrhea, and vomiting.  The day prior to admission, he developed a diffuse popular rash.  He was seen in clinic on 5/20 and lab work was obtained, which was consistent with MIS-C findings (elevated troponin, elevated fibrinogen, elevated CRP, hyponatremia, relatively low absolute lymphocyte count).

From EHR note: Patient is an otherwise healthy 12yM with recent Lyme disease (erythema migrans) transferred to hospital for hyponatremia, encephalitis, myocarditis. Initially intubated due to aspiration risk, now s/p extubation and stable on RA. Broad workup so far including consultations from neurology, cardiology, immunology, and infectious disease with unclear etiology, s/p MRI and LP with c/f covid-vaccine related myocarditis/encephalitis vs lyme carditis/meningoencephalitis vs less likely MISC vs other. Infectious testing so far negative, patient otherwise has returned to baseline behavior without any current symptoms. He is transferred to general for further workup and evaluation and close monitoring. Diagnosed with Lyme 19 days prior to admission,  treated with amoxicillin; p/w headache, fever and vomiting so concern for encephalitis as above vs inflammatory process post-COVID or vaccine. Less likely meningitis given reassuring initial CSF studies. Negative COVID antibody.  Resolving hyponatremia, thought to be likely SIADH. Given presentation and maternal history of albinism with immunodeficiency, broad workup sent. Also with c/f possible inflammatory response/MISC-C vs vaccine myocarditis.

                                                My son experienced under his left arm he had swelling of lymph nodes, on the middle of his armpit. The next day it was bigger and it was tender to touch, very painful. He also had some swollen lymph nodes on his neck, left side, near the collar bone and side of his ear. His lymph nodes got bigger on Saturday, the one on his left arm was getting smaller and the one on his neck today is going down in size as well.  My son was by a nurse practitioner, and she said that my son did not have any fever, he said it was consistent with the vaccine he received.   To this day his lymph nodes are still present but getting smaller in size.

He was also short of breath and the pain was worse when lying down. The day after the vaccine, he had fever and emesis, but that resolved within 24 hours. He was taken to  hospital where he was noted to have a troponin of 6.611, and CRP of 1.8. He was transferred to another Hospital for further care. He was treated with IV Toradol. He was seen by cardiology and infectious disease. He showed improvement with nothing more than NSAIDs, and since his MRI was normal, he was not given IVIG.

Later in the day he felt a lump in his armpit (I am assuming lymph node).  It hurt to touch the lump and hurt any time he moved his arm.  Pain continued today, June 10th, and the lump under his arm is quite big at around 1.5 inches.  It is squishy to touch.  Painful to touch or move arm all day today as well.  No other symptoms (no fever, chills, etc).

                                                Patient received 1st dose Pfizer COVID vaccine at a store/pharmacy on 5/25/21.  Presented to ED with chest pain on 5/28.  Diagnosed with myocarditis and admitted to the hospital.  ED attending note:  Patient presents with acute onset of chest discomfort in the sternal area 2 days after the first dose of Covid vaccine.  Patient&#39;s not had any fevers.  No respiratory symptoms.  No difficulty with respirations or any pleuritic chest pain.  Denies any cough.  No chest wall trauma.  No back pain.  No palpitations or syncope.  No orthostasis.  No peripheral edema.  On physical exam he was mildly tachycardic in the 80s to low 90s with no murmur and no gallop.  No JVD.  Clear lungs.  No rub.  Bedside ultrasound performed by HCP had bilateral lung sliding and normal gross function based on 2 views.  No pericardial effusion.  EKG had ST changes.  Chest x-ray was obtained without any effusions or pulmonary infiltrates.  Normal cardiac silhouette.  Troponin sent elevated.  Cardiology consulted for possible postvaccination myocarditis.  Child remained stable.  Resting heart rates in the 70s and low 80s.  Cardiology came to see the patient.  Plan to admit to cardiology service.  Presumed diagnosis of myocarditis.   Cardiology admitting note:  Pt. is an otherwise healthy 14yM who presents with acute onset atraumatic chest pain i/s/o recent covid vaccine, found to have mildly elevated inflammatory markers and troponin with borderline ST changes on EKG most consistent with mild peri/myocarditis at this time given overall well appearance on exam without hemodynamic or respiratory compromise and grossly normal function on POCUS, though plan for formal echo in AM. EKG w/ non-specific ST-T wave changes in precordial leads, no evidence of strain or block. Admitted to the cardiology service for serial troponins, ECHO, and close monitoring.  HPI per cardiology consult note:  &#34;Patient is a healthy 14 year old with a history of alopecia who presented to the ED with mild chest pain 4 days following his first Covid vaccine (Pfizer). He had no symptoms in the days immediately following vaccine, and played basketball the day following with no symptoms, but after waking up today began having dull mid sternal chest pain. It was a 4/10, worse with lying down, non pleuritic, not sharp, and not radiating pain and not associated with any other symptoms including SOB, numbness, GI pain, cough, or anything else. Has not taken any meds for the pain. Has not exercised today. Felt &#34;warm&#34; this AM, but didn&#39;t check temperature and felt better throughout the day. No palpitations, dizziness. Denies ever having chest pain before and no recent illnesses or sick contacts. No notable fhx of cardiac disease. In the ED, troponin mildly elevated to 0.12 ng/mL and CRP 5 with low ESR and BNP. Bedside point-of-care US reportedly showed no clear effusion with grossly normal function. HR mainly in 70s in ED and normotensive. EKG with borderline nonspecific ST elevation in V3-V6.&#34;

A 14-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left in May2021 at 10:45 AM (Batch/Lot Number: ER8736) (at age of the 14-year-old) as 1st dose, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included precocious puberty, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and the patient had known allergy to animal: Pet dander. The patient received methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA), guanfacine (GUANFACINE), vitamin c [ascorbic acid], melatonin within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks and prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.  In May2021, the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes (mild swelling) in left armpit. The patient did not receive any treatment of the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

After a little while, he got up and was able to take some Tylenol and attend his video school day with frequent breaks. In afternoon, he started to feel worse. 102. 6 fever - we called Tele-doc appt. His throat was sore and he had some chest pain. The doctor recommended that we go to ER to have him fully evaluated. Pain and fever got better with the Tylenol. He took another couple of dose. Next morning, he had a lot better but continued to have a low fever 100.2 - on and off that day. His lymph nodes under his left arm were quite swollen and painful. The fever did not continue yesterday but the swelling has and the pain has. He was very light-headed and brain fogged on Sunday and Monday. Seems to be better today - the lymph nodes have gone down a lot but are still swollen today. He is  in process of recovering.

                                                My 15-year-old son received dose #2 of Pfizer?s Covid-19 vaccine at 10:30am on 6/6/21. At 1:00am on 6/8/21 he was struggling to breathe due to pain in the center of his chest upon inhalation. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before. His chest pain was worse lying down and he could not lie down or sleep and wanted to stay standing on his feet. He felt pain in both forearms too. He was crying from the pain and the difficulty of breathing, and was very tired but unable to recline in order to sleep. I called the advice nurse, who checked with the doctor on call at his pediatrician?s office, and she told us to go to the ER due to concern it may be myocarditis or pericarditis.
