It eventually radiated over up into the left quadrant of his chest where he could not push down on it.  It was extremely painful by Monday.  He has a history of esophageal spasms and exacerbated them to where he thought he was having a heart attack.  He called his Cardiologist and told him to go to the ER.  He went to the hospital Monday evening, he had two EKG&#39;s, had blood drawn 3 times, did sonograms looking for blood clots.  He did inform them that he had the vaccine on Friday and they told him it was due to that.  He went to nuclear medicine to get his lung checked for blood clots as well.  All tests were negative.  He saw his PCP today who told him that the lymph nodes were affected due to the vaccine.  He has improved greatly, still has some slight discomfort which his PCP said would go away in time.

Treatment team COVID-19 virus infection Principal problem HPI: For complete history and physical see the H&amp;P dictated by Dr. on 4/28/2021.  This is a 76-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with upper respiratory symptoms for three days.  He reports having cough, sneezing, runny nose and poor appetite.  His caregiver had Covid recently and he was exposed.  He was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.   Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted inpatient to the medical surgical floor.  He was not on telemetry.  Patient reports that his caregiver had recently tested positive for Covid and he was exposed.  He has been having upper respiratory symptoms including cough, sneezing, and runny nose.  His COVID-19 test was positive.       He was started on the COVID-19 treatment protocol which included IV remdesivir and IV dexamethasone.  He underwent a CT scan of the chest which showed small patchy areas of groundglass infiltrates in the peripheral portions of the left and right upper lobes and also the posterior aspects of the right lung base.  These findings are probably due to pneumonia.        Hospital course consisted of gentle hydration with IV normal saline.  He was also started on antibiotic therapy oral azithromycin and IV Rocephin.  He had completed the course of antibiotics while on the unit, therefore, at the time of discharge no antibiotics were prescribed.  He initially was hypoxic and started on nasal cannula oxygen to maintain pulse oximetry greater than 92%.  Eventually, oxygen was weaned and pulse oximetry on room air has remained in the 95-96% range.       He has a history of diabetes mellitus and while on the unit blood glucose levels have fluctuated.  His point-of-care glucose have been in the 80-500 range.  He has had numerous episodes of hypoglycemia and insulin has been adjusted.  The fluctuations of the blood glucose levels may be secondary to IV dexamethasone.  At the time of discharge he will continue dexamethasone 6mg daily for the next three days.  He was advised to increase insulin 70/25 insulin five units daily for the next thre days.  After that time he can return to his normal dose of insulin.  He also had been treated with IV remdesivir and had completed the 5-day course.      On examination today he has been asymptomatic.  He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  The initial lab studies showed an elevated creatinine level, although he has a history of chronic kidney disease.  At the time of discharge the creatinine level trended downward and he was advised to follow-up with the primary care provider for possible repeat BMP in 1 to 2 weeks.  All other lab studies have been within normal limits.        The systolic blood pressure has been in the 120-150 range.  The most recent systolic blood pressure was 151/66 mmHg with a heart rate of 66 bpm.  He denies any lightheadedness or dizziness.  He was advised to continue all of his current medications.  While on the unit he was in isolation secondary to COVID-19.  At the time of discharge he should maintain social distancing/isolation, mask wearing and good handwashing.  He will will need to follow-up with the primary care provider.  He was also advised if the oxygen level dips below 89% he will need to return to the emergency department.  At this time he is resting comfortably, offers no complaints and is stable for discharge.       Patient is alert, oriented answering all questions appropriately.  He is continent of bowel and bladder.   Heis able to make his own decisions.  He is able to performhis own ADLs.  .  At this time he is in agreement with the plan and feels comfortable to be discharged home. Thank you.

                                                Following Dose 1,  Right Arm became sore at injection site for 4 days, at which time Right armpit became very tender touch and was swollen about size of silver dollar, approx. 1/2 inch thick.  Soreness at injection site subsided over the next 17 days, but tenderness in armpit only diminished slightly.  Following Dose 2, Right Arm was once again sore at injection site for about 4 days, but tenderness to the right armpit became more pronounced, with swelling increasing to the size of a hockey puck.  Size of swelling was easily visible to the eye.  Armpit became more tender to the touch, and has diminished only slightly in size,, as of this reporting.  Mass remains soft to the feel, but easily defined in size and location.  I have taken OTC pain killers to help with the discomfort.  Will continue to monitor its progress, unless notified otherwise.  Do not anticipate seeing my physician at this point.  Have consulted the Web, and have noted that this is a lesser side effect of this vaccine, if swelling remains localized to the injection site.  Thought I should report this side effect only because of the size of the swelling that occured.

On 2/17 (three days after vaccination), he sought care in the emergency department for chest pain that worsened when he was supine and shortness of breath.   EKG in the emergency room showed STEMI and troponin levels were normal. He was transferred to a different facility for cardiac catheterization. Cath showed mild circumflex disease and a stent was placed. He was diagnosed with pericarditis at that time (elevated inflammatory markers ESR/CRP). He was discharged home post cath on Plavix/ASA.   He had an echocardiogram at his PCP?s office on 2/25, results still pending (as of 3/10).  2/25 ? televist with cardiologist who concurred with pericarditis, maybe mild coronary artery disease (follow-up scheduled 3/11).  3/3 chest pain symptom improved further, no cough, improved shortness of breath.      Medications at home: statin, previously colchine for gout, likely BP medication (PCP will send records)  Allergies: None known.  Vaccine Indication: Age &gt;75

Seen in ambulatory clinic 7 days prior to presentation, given ibuprofen and percocet without relief. New swelling and erythema brought pt to hospital. Around time of vaccination, the pt was using triamcinolone for left forearm rash (described as small, more-spotty and resolved quickly). MRI revealed an abscess (10 x 6.8 x 1 cm) deep to the deltoid muscle and along the lateral aspect of the left proximal humerus. He also has another abscess within the posterior deltoid muscle (3.1 x 2.1 x 2.8 cm). There is surrounding myositis, fasciitis and cellulitis.

The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received a first Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday (20Jan2021) morning at about 9am. And he woke up this morning everything was fine until this morning, Saturday morning (23Jan2021) and he woke up with his left side of his mouth and face, the lips, the cheeks of the left side are very swollen. They didn&#39;t do any lab work or blood. The patient did not receive any treatment. The only other question was whether he should go to the emergency room. He could breathe, he could swallow. The event outcome was unknown.

A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL9261 with Expiration Date 31May2021), via intramuscular, on 22Jan2021 (at 09:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing restless legs syndrome and ongoing acid reflux. Relevant concomitant medications included omeprazole ongoing from an unknown date for acid reflux and gabapentin ongoing from an unknown date for restless legs syndrome. Her husband had the injection on Friday 22Jan2021. The next morning his left foot was swollen up really bad, red and tender and he could not walk on it. He has had problems like that before and he had it checked and was told it is not gout. It did not go away and she called the nurse on Sunday morning, and the nurse did not think it was a reaction and told her that a lot of times it is swelling in the lymph nodes. He was advised to go and see a podiatrist on Monday. He saw the podiatrist yesterday morning and the podiatrist gave him a one injection that contained Lidocaine, dexamethasone, and depomederol. After injection, the swelling right down and his foot was ok. The patient went to go get the Moderna injection and she asked those giving the injection if it was ok for her husband to get that injection from the podiatrist. She was told that people are not supposed to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) or ibuprofen. She was told that they did not think it was a good idea for her husband to get that injection from the podiatrist and it may have wiped out the benefit of the Pfizer COVID VACCINE. His foot was 95% recovered, he could walk on it and the swelling was down. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                There was a significant drug interaction with Efudex Cream that I was applying topically to a pre-cancerous 2-cm-diameter lesion on my left shin. On the day of my first Pfizer shot, the Efudex treated lesion was progressing normally from the desquamation (scabbing and shedding of epithelial scales) to the erosion stage (starting to form a shallow 2.5-cm-diameter ulcer). Starting about Saturday 30 January (three days after the first Pfizer shot) and slowly increasing for the next four days, the Efudex-treated ulcer became deeper, the peripheral 12-cm-diameter skin became redder, and the left foot and ankle became increasingly swollen.  My RN-wife and I (a former medical-research physicist) began research andChronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg &amp; foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral. Chronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg &amp; foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral.DVERSE EFFECTS, TREATMENT, AND OUTCOME:  discovered that Efudex should not be given concurrently with any of a long list of immunizations.  This is an Efudex problem that should gain another immunization onto that list. Being within a week of finishing the Efudex regimen, we monitored the Efudex-treatment area and the peripheral area carefully. On Thursday 4 Feb (eight days after the first Pfizer shot), the ulcer began unusual drainage, the 12-cm-diameter peripheral area became inflamed, and swelling of the left ankle and foot increased to almost skin-tight - I can upload photos if you need.  Time for immediate action.  My excellent Dermatologist stopped Efudex and started me on Bactrim by mouth for 10 days, and Gentamicin topical antibiotic on the ulcerated central area and Triamcinolone topical corticosteroid on the peripheral and swollen areas for three weeks.  Good choices.  Improvement was immediate and continued improving for the next three weeks.  By the time of the second Pfizer shot on 24 February, the central area was healing well, in the late-reepithelialization stage (regrowth of epithelial tissue that now formed a completely-covering scar tissue with no oozing), and with all inflammation and swelling completely gone.  After the second Pfizer shot (taken 20 days after stopping Efudex), there were zero adverse effects of any kind. NOTE: There were absolutely zero other adverse effects of any kind throughout the entire series: no chills, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in pulse or blood pressure (120/70 range), loss of taste or smell, sore throat, cough, lung congestion, fatigue, feeling of being unwell, shortness of breath, injection-site swelling or redness, hives, swelling of face, decreased kidney function, or other adverse cardiovascular, neurological or pulmonary effects. There was no additional joint pain above my normal osteoarthritis.  After both shots, I felt a slight normal-range injection-site soreness for the next few hours, but no site swelling, rash, redness, or other problem.  We recommend that this immunization be added to the Efudex  proscribed or warned&#39; list.

Intense pain for about 5 days similar to when I had back surgery about 27 years ago.  Since then leg and hip pain subsided but my right foot still feels swollen and painful at night and in the morning.  Gets better temporarily walking on it during day but feel like there is a stiff pad below the skin on my foot .  Had a similar reaction with second pneumonia shot in October where I got spasms in lower back and then right leg started to collapse but only lasted then for about 5 minutes with no long term effects/

                                                Progressive lower extremity weakness with markedly diminished reflex: Per the history it appears that patient has had a progressive course of this problem over the last 1 week.  His symptomatology is mostly consistent with gait ataxia with some lower extremity weakness.  He mentions that his weakness of the lower extremities became more and more pronounced towards the end of the week when he would start trembling in his legs whenever standing for some time.  Although he had some numbness and tingling few days ago but that does not seem to be the predominant symptoms.  There was no preceding symptoms of any viremia prior to this.  Although he has Covid in January, however he did not have cough expectorations upper respiratory infection or any diarrhea in the last 1 month.  He has not been exposed to any new pets or any new medications.  His clinical exam suggest a lower extremity weakness more proximal than distal although there appears to be some sensory sparing.  He has diminished reflexes all over including absent reflexes in his lower extremities and many of the upper extremities.  His imaging study did not show any specific etiology for the cause of his problem.  He does not have any spinal etiology and his exam does not show any upper motor type of involvement.  His spinal fluid shows a high protein with no cells consistent with cytoalbuminogenic dissociation.  So he definitely fits with the diagnosis of acute immune mediated demyelinating polyneuropathy or Guillain-Barré syndrome.  On IVIG therapy.  Overall appears to be some improved however not still able to walk.

                                                A little over a week ago I was admitted to a local hospital having been diagnosed with Guillain?Barré syndrome, a debilitating condition where the body?s auto immune system attacks the nervous system resulting in peripheral numbness in one?s hands, feet and legs. This condition was diagnosed by a neurologist. Following his diagnosis, I spent 8 days in the Hospital and was treated for 5 days with a daily dose of 400ml of immune globulin (IVIG) to rebuild the damage to my nervous system.   On April 10, I began to feel the onset of Guillain Barré syndrome as the bottoms of my feet suddenly began to tingle and feel numb. The next day I tripped while returning our waste management garbage cans to our garage.  Fell face forward onto the driveway and was bruised pretty bad.  The next day my BP zoomed to 224/160.  911 was called and I was taken to our local hospital fearing and thinking that I was having a heart attack.  I spent 4 days in the hospital being checked for a possible heart attack and all the while my Guillain Barré syndrome was progressing undiagnosed.  I was discharged and instructed to see a neurologist for the tingling and numbness in my hands, legs and feet.  Within 15 minutes of the neurologist consult,  a few days following my discharge, I was told I had Guillain Barré syndrome and get to a hospital. I left his office and went straight to the emergency room and I spent the next 8 days there and was discharged Tuesday, 4 May 2021. Several hospital neurologists treating me  believed the vaccination triggered the syndrome as do I.  It&#39;s not being widely reported even though there have been several Facebook postings of people saying the same thing as me.

                                                On March 2, he woke up feeling bad and had a fever of 102.7. He took tylenol and liquids all day and the fever came down to around 100. The next morning he woke up complaining of excruciating pain in his left arm (site of the injection). He couldn&#39;t stand to have anything touch it, couldn&#39;t move it and couldn&#39;t sleep because of the pain. The next morning he woke up very weak, wasn&#39;t able to speak clearly, wasn&#39;t making sense. He had a telemedicine appointment scheduled that morning for another matter. The doctor took one look at him and said we should have him evaluated asap. I took him to the emergency room at Hospital. They did some tests and said he was septic and immediately put him into the ICU.  He was started on IV antibiotics while the blood cultures were growing out.  It was determined that the bacteria was Strep G but they were unable to identify the source.  He was put on a ventilator and an echo cardiogram was done.  It was believed that the source of the infection was his pacemaker and I was told the pacemaker would have to be removed.  They couldn&#39;t do it at that hospital.  He was transferred to another hospital.  The doctors at that hospital determined the pacemaker was not the source.  It was believed by some doctors that the source of infection was the injection site.  The infection was cleared from his body and the ventilator was removed after 2 weeks.  He lived another 2 weeks but never was able to recover. Until the day he was put on paliative care, he expressed pain in the arm where he had received the vaccination. He died at 5:30 a.m. on April 1, 2021.

A 79-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL3248), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 27Jan2021 11:00 (at 79-years age) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes and hypertension (he was diabetic and was on blood pressure medication, but both his hypertension was under control, and his diabetes, sure his A1C is higher than it should be but was under control with oral medication), root canal infection (though this was contributed to the root canal which he had on 29Jan2021, the root canal was on the lower left of the mouth, tooth number 20). Patient provided relevant Family medical History of Hypertension. Concomitant Medications: He was just taking his general medications, like his maintenance medication, nothing out of the normal. He had no other vaccines on the same day as the covid vaccine or in the 4 weeks prior. He had no positive covid or antibody test prior to the first dose (he had never had a test).On 08Feb2021, the patient had the 1st occurrence of swelling was like golf ball size, it was visible, but it went away after 3-4 hours and he didn&#39;t have to take anything. Then on the 11Feb2021, the patient woke up at 4:30AM, experienced the swelling and it felt numb, the numb feeling starting on left side of cheek and wound up settling in upper lip, it gave him a distorted appearance, it was severe. The swelling in the mouth, that wound up settling in upper lip which was the 2nd occurrence in a 3-day period. The first occurrence was swelling, not as severe, in the lower inside of the mouth in the lower right inside of the gum, the swelling appearance from the outside, though this was contributed to the root canal (had on 29Jan2021). The swelling in the mouth from 08Feb2021 subsided for him in 3-4 hours. He called endodontist, and told her about the second swelling, she said to come in and look at it, that was on 11Feb2021, she took X-rays and result was normal, she said it was not connected to the root canal and told him to contact his Primary and go from there, he agreed with her because he did not feel any type of sensitivity. On 11Feb2021, patient then called the Primary Care doctor, told how he developed the swelling, and the primary care said that he would rather see an ENT specialist and he got an appointment with the ENT that same day 11Feb2021 at 15:00 in the afternoon. The patient went to see him, the ENT checked his mouth out, checked his nose and throat, he did not know what it was stemming from, and said he will put him on an antibiotic. On 11Feb2021, the ENT said that the patient did had a swollen gland he noticed on the left side. The swelling in the mouth on the 11Feb2021 on his lip lasted about 2 days, his upper lip irritated on inside for a day or 2, but it lasted till about the 13Feb2021. On 11Feb2021 (5 days ago), the patient was put on an antibiotic for swelling that occurred in his mouth which was Clindamycin HCL 300mg, 3 pills a day with his last 2 pills of antibiotics falls same day (18Feb2021) as his second vaccine dose was scheduled on Thursday (18Feb2021; appeared to be scheduled outside of the 21-day recommendation). Patient felt like he was sort of on edge for another occurrence possibly happening. Being on the antibiotic, maybe this was some type of infection. The ENT told honestly that he didn&#39;t know why this happened, but if it happened again, he might have a CT scan for the suspect salivary gland, maybe it was clogged or there was an infection in the gland. He asked if he should take the pills or reschedule the vaccine dose and if it was ok to receive the second shot while on this antibiotic (his prescribing doctor couldn&#39;t give an answer). On 18Feb2021, the patient was due to have booster. Patient would have 2 pills left on the 18Feb2021, after that he was finished. Therapeutic measures of antibiotic were taken as a result of swelling that occurred in his mouth (mouth swelling). He did not have to go to the emergency room for the mouth swelling but he has visited the physician&#39;s office. The outcome for swelling in the mouth and lips was recovered on 13Feb2021 (Duration 5 Day); outcome for swollen gland was unknown.  Follow up (16Feb2021): This is a follow up spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer reported patient information, new event information.

This 80-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: UNKNOWN) via unspecified route in Apr2021 (at the age of 79-years-old) as a single dose for the corona virus, to get rid of it/ it&#39;s supposed to be sure he didn&#39;t get it. Patient had no medical history. There was no relevant family medical history. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the COVID-vaccine. Patient had no adverse events following prior vaccinations. He remembers his first polio shot he got that back in the early 50&#39;s and his second shot was a cube of sugar, called the salt vaccine. Stated he&#39;s been getting vaccines for a long time and he never had any trouble with any of them. The patient previously received the initial dose of the BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) in 2021 (March or April) in the left arm which was deemed invalid by the vaccination provider due to temperature related issues (i.e wasn&#39;t cold enough). He explained he received a letter informing him of this incident and recommending a replacement dose (which he thinks was on 06Apr2021). About 2 to 3 weeks before he got his first COVID shot, he got a flu shot in his left arm, about 4 or 5 inches above where he got his COVID shot. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not specified. He reported that the second vaccine (BNT162b2) caused him problems. On 06May2021, he woke up with his right wrist twice as thick as his left one, it was swollen real bad. The right wrist was quite sore and painful. He didn&#39;t know if he was getting carpal tunnel or what it was, so he went to the ER about it and they gave him three different kinds of pills, two of which included tramadol 50mg one every day and ibuprofen 400 mg. The ER couldn&#39;t determine the cause for his reaction. About 3-4 days after taking the prescribed medication, his reaction subsided quite a bit and was not nearly as hurtful, but his left wrist then started swelling and being painful/sore. Therefore, he continued to take his medication and it improved. It was like that for a couple/ three days, and it calmed down. He thought he was okay 2-3 days ago, but this morning (14May2021), his right shoulder was swollen and pretty sore and was getting worse; he was in so much pain, so sore he could hardly even move his arm, he couldn&#39;t pick it up straight in the air, couldn&#39;t get his elbow up past his ear. The patient also reported that when he got off his bed, his left knee was sore and it felt like a fire underneath his kneecap and he was having trouble walking. The left knee was swollen real bad and was hotter than a firecracker. Thus, he went back to taking his pill again. The knee pain started the morning  of 14May2021 about the same time it seemed and has worsened, and he took a 400mg ibuprofen and the other pill he&#39;s taking, &#34;100 mg doxycycline or something&#34;. Patient hadn&#39;t been doing much since, he was feeling kind of laid up, he had thought it was all done with yesterday (13May2021). He stated he&#39;s been hearing things about allergic reactions to this COVID shot, was sure that a lot of people are having complaints of allergic reactions, and was sure he&#39;s not the only one who has had a problem like this. He asked if there was anything he can take to block it because he is sure when this calms down after a week or whatever, it will be his in his right knee or left shoulder or wrists or ankles and he&#39;s 100% it&#39;s about that COVID shot. He stated he&#39;s never had arthritis before. He stated that he has never had any problems like this before. He is supposed to go see his doctor in a week or two. He tried to call the doctor to make an appointment, but he figured he would wait a couple days, but he is hurting bad today (14May2021), and he hasn&#39;t been to anybody yet except for the ER. The patient stated it looks like the vaccine is methodically causing this spread into his body. He also reported that it feels warm outside of his left wrist, towards the edge of it and all the way to the joint of the little finger and he thinks the swelling will start again. He expressed feeling anxious about his reactions. He asked if there were any kinds of pills he could take to block the effects of the vaccine from working in his body. He stated it seems like it&#39;s going from one area to the next and it seems like it&#39;s going through his joints and he doesn&#39;t like that. His left wrist still got a little bit of soreness in the back near the joint, but doesn&#39;t appear to be swollen.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

A 80-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in last week Tuesday, on 06Apr2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history included hernia and relapsing polychondritis. Concomitant medications were not reported. Upon call E-transferring to unit the patient mentioned that his symptoms started last week and he was able to notice a couple a days ago that his left cheek was swollen and red and he thought that it was sunburn but it started to itch a couple of days ago and his cheek was swollen to about the size of a softball in circumference and about 1/8th to 1/16th of an inch thick which takes up the whole check. He further stated that he also had red dots on the skin near his left eye. He mentioned that he will be seeing his Cardiologist shortly for a hernia that appeared. The patient has an extremely rare condition called Relapsing Polychondritis in which his ears bleed from and takes steroids for it.

From H&amp;P &#34;He reports that he woke up this morning and then subsequently started developing left-sided chest discomfort, it was pleuritic in nature.  It is sometimes worse with position.  He traveled to the Emergency Room where he was found to be mildly hypoxemic.  He underwent workup to include a CT angiogram, which revealed multiple predominantly small peripheral bilateral pulmonary emboli with borderline dilation of the main pulmonary artery and slightly greater than 1:1 right to left ratio.  He subsequently was felt to be appropriate for admission because of his underlying hypoxemia.  He denies any unilateral weakness or stroke symptoms.  He does have a patent foramen ovale.  He also reports no history of calf discomfort.

                                                Patient is a 81 y.o. gentleman with a history of smoldering multiple myeloma, urinary retention for which he self catheterizes twice daily, as well as recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation that presents complaining of increasing weakness and falls.  Patient fell 2/18 pm trying to get out of bed and he took about 20 minutes to get himself to a position where he could pull himself back up.  Again 2/19 he was trying to get up and his legs were too weak to carry him and he fell to the ground.  He needed assistance to get up and family asked him to come to emergency room for evaluation.  He has been feeling poorly for about a month, with poor appetite and has lost about 15 pounds.  He is not nauseated or short of breath and has no cough.  He was apparently treated for UTI about 4 to 6 weeks ago after a visit to urgent care.  He has since been to a different urgent care and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which was new in onset and was referred to a cardiologist who is planning to do a stress test in a few weeks.  I believe he is on Eliquis now.  In ER he was found to have significant pyuria and bacteriuria and was given a dose of Rocephin.  Renal function shows worsening from levels in December although it is pretty stable over the past month from looking through other labs.

These were done in in his home state.  I am in a different state.  I saw him last week and he had muscle pain and arthritic symptoms.  Sedimentation rate was elevated.  Started on prednisone with some improvement.

                                                My RA began to really act up.  My whole body stiffened up-(legs, hands, hips, back).  Lower back made it hart to bend over, Rt shoulder had a swelling and hurt at a pinch point in shoulder, my rt hip hurt when I walked more than 0.25 miles, my hands swelled and could not use hand well. Did not initially link to Covid shot, so called my Rheumatologist on the sixth day that the symptoms continued.  Received prescription to reduce muscle  tension and an anti inflamatory.  However, a couple of days after talking to my doctor and before taking any of the prescribed meds, the symptoms went away and since that time, my RA is back to typical old symptoms and pain level.

I had had occassional r shoulder pain in the past without a diagnosis or specific  Rx. 2 days before 2nd dose, i b raised upper L ulna. 2 days post 2nd dose, rather severe olecranon pain developed dwith expuisite tenderness and mild swelling, but no fever. Subsequently over a period of days and weeks, I developed worsening right and then left shoulder and some neck pain and some additional hip and other pain. Shoulder tyenderness was diffuse and mostly muscular, Siginficant limitations of ROM withinability to raise arms. Pain was worst at night and on awakening with some relief with acetaminophen (no NSAIDS as on Xarelto).

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right shoulder on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 81-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, stage 3 renal failure (was not bad, was in stage 5 couple of years ago, was a month or so away from full failure, was in the hospital and had dialysis, was able to get reversed with medication and diet), high blood pressure, and blood cholesterol increased/high cholesterol. The reporter stated that with regards to patient&#39;s height, he shrunk a little. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, didn&#39;t get flu shots. Concomitant medications include about 12 other unspecified drugs, takes statins, has high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Patient started experiencing pain behind his left knee about 6 or 7 days later in Mar2021 (also reported as 04 or 05Apr2021, pending clarification). By that Sunday, it had gotten worse. The leg swelled and was also having foot swelling because blood flow wasn&#39;t there. There was no TIA&#39;s no stroke, no heart racing, no sweating, was all pain. Got leg up and kept elevated until they could get to the doctor and get imaging. Patient went Monday 08Mar2021 to see the doctor. Patient was brought to the doctor and was then sent to the imaging place. Radiology read the imaging around 5:15pm on the Monday, 08Mar2021. The radiologist said there was 2.5&#34; blood clot behind the left knee. He had never had a blood clot before. Patient was then sent to the Emergency Room at (Name) Hospital, in (Name) where they live. Was kept there several hours. Did a lot more blood tests. He was immediately put on 10mg ELIQUIS 10mg, once in the morning, and once at night. He is now taking 5mg Eliquis in the morning, and 5mg at night. He has not had any of these problems before the Pfizer shot. The reporter knew that not a lot had been reported. It seemed it should be safe. The correlation and timing having the shot on 23Feb2021 and all of a sudden a week and a half later this happened. It was 10 days later. There was nothing they can do about it. Just continuing with the ELIQUIS, trying to dissolve the blood clot, will be staying on it for 4 to 6 months. It was a pretty big blood clot and were worried about it breaking up and traveling. The patient had no other symptoms, had a sore arm, that was it. Patient going back to (Name) 01Jun2021 and he will have another CT scan or ultra sound when they get back. The reporter did not want to need to get the leg amputated. Patient was only in the ER, was not admitted to the hospital. Patient was concerned because of his age. If it doesn&#39;t dissolve, they know there will be a lot more trouble. The event of pain left knee, blood clot and sore arm required a visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 on 01Apr2021 (lot number: ER8730) in the right arm. The outcome of events was unknown.

ER work-up concerning for severe sepsis with acute hypoxic respiratory failure for which he was admitted to the PCU under the hospitalist service.   Hospital Course He was treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir but remained hypoxic requiring alternating trials of high flow nasal cannula and BiPAP for which pulmonology was consulted on 5/12.  Unfortunately, he did not tolerate prone positioning.  Despite his advanced age and several risk factors, he slowly but surely progressed from a pulmonary standpoint.  He was weaned off high flow oxygen 2 days ago and deemed stable for downgrade to MedSurg with telemetry at that time.  Since then he has continued to recover well, now requiring 6 L of oxygen with activity and 4 L at all other times.  He is anxious to be discharged home and appears medically stable to do so with home health care services, remote patient monitoring and outpatient pulmonology follow-up with PAL as prior to hospitalization.  Prior to discharge, all questions were answered and patient and his son expressed understanding, appreciation and agreement with the discharge plan at this time.   Treatments: IV hydration, analgesia: acetaminophen, cardiac meds: metoprolol, furosemide and aldactone, anticoagulation: eliquis, steroids: dexamethasone, respiratory therapy: O2 and remdesivir

Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21. At 1500 on 1/20/21 patient was noted to be lying supine in bed, visiting with aides. At 1508 nurse entered room and noted patient to be lying on floor supine and nurse was unable to get patient to respond to shaking or calling his name. Breathing was noted to be labored, and nurse was unable to detect a pulse. At 1509, 911 was called and CPR initiated. Spontaneous pulse and breathes resumed just before ambulance arrived at 1522. On arrival at the ED patient was responsive and breathing spontaneously, however, hemodynamically unstable. Patient went into cardiac arrest and code blue called at 1535. Received treatment with epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, amiodarone, atropine. Patient was intubated. EKG obtained and showed acute MI. At 1622 he again went into cardiac arrest and time of death was called.

Uncomplicated alcohol dependence (HCC) 05/05/2021 Yes   Resolved Hospital Problems No resolved problems to display.   CONSULTS: None    INPATIENT PROCEDURES: None   DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY:   PRESENTING PROBLEM: Patient is a 83 y.o. male with Hx of HTN who presents today with complaint of right sided flank pain, with radiations into the right side of his back and right side of his chest. The pain is worse with movement and deep inspiration. He denies palpitations and shortness of breath. He has no previous HX of VTE. He denies fever, chills, cough, nasal congestion, and sore throat. He denies abdominal pain, N/V, and changes in bowel movements. The patient is a limited historian. He is oriented x4 on admission, but states that he has had difficulty with his memory over the past 2-3 years. He lives alone in an apartment.   In the emergency department the patient&#39;s vital signs were stable.  Labs revealed a potassium of 3.3.  AST was 52 and ALT 61. White blood cell count was 11.13.  Troponin was negative and BNP was within normal limits.  Lactic acid was 1.5.  UA showed trace blood.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with PACs.  CTA the thorax abdomen and pelvis showed acute pulmonary emboli involving the segmental subsegmental arteries of the upper and lower lobes.  There is no evidence of heart strain. He was admitted for observation due to severe pain, and was given IV fentanyl.  Echocardiogram showed: The left ventricular ejection fraction is 67%. No regional wall motion abnormalities noted. The right ventricular size, thickness, and function are normal. The estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 36 mmHg. The inferior vena cava was not visualized during the exam. There is no comparison study available.    He was started on Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, than 5 mg bid for total of 3 months.  He should follow up with PCP in 1 week and should check CBC and BMP on 5/10/21. He should also follow up with pulmonologist in 2-3 months.  He had Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 2/18/21 and 3/18/21. There is remote possibility that this PE could be related to COVID-19 vaccine, so this was reported to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). He had mild hypokalemia due to HCTZ, and required K-dur supplement. HCTZ was switched to Maxzide 25/37.5 mg daily. Rechecked K was normal 3.9. BMP should be checked in 1 week. Also he is drinking little bit too much alcohol, 4 alcoholic drinks every night. He was instructed to cut alcohol drinking to &lt;/=2 alcoholic drink a day.  His daughter was updated over the phone.

An 84-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 22Jan2021, patient arm hurt, started to feel pain on 22Jan2021 and in the morning his arm was very swollen and very sore. He got up in the middle of the night and he said that his arm was swollen, and it was warm and swollen very hard, and 5 days later, the arm was still hard and warm and it was still very painful for him to touch where the injection went in. Caller was very concerned that this point that 5 days later could the shot gone in and then not gone anywhere just be sitting in that muscle. Patient can&#39;t touch it because it hurt too much. It was reported patient was not comfortable. Outcome of events was unknown.

Both shots were given into the left arm.  He reports some soreness at the injection site on the left arm after both shots, but this soreness has persisted with some stiffness and difficulty abducting the arm beyond 90 degrees.  Two weeks after the first shot, his right shoulder started hurting also, worst distal to the glenohumeral fossa without radiation, also aggravated with abduction beyond 90 degrees.  Some soft tissue swelling was noted around the hand.   Simvastatin was discontinued with no improvement in symptoms.  Labs showed a sed rate of 54 mm/hr and C-reactive protein of 46 mg/L.  Blood cultures were drawn which were negative, suggesting no evidence of osteomyelitis flare.  He was started on prednisone 15 mg PO daily on 4/5/2021 with rapid and dramatic improvement in symptoms.  Presumptive diagnosis is polymyalgia rheumatica, but he had no previous history of same, and onset of symptoms was remarkably close to the immunizations.

A 84-years-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 13Feb2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, occasionally rapid heart beat, blood cholesterol abnormal, cardiac operation (9 years ago, macular degeneration (in each eye and puts eyedrops in and occasionally they give him injections). Concomitant medication(s) included atorvastatin (LIPITOR [ATORVASTATIN]; 10mg everyday) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal; estradiol (ESTROGEN; 10mg everyday). The patient did not have any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient reported practically had no symptoms with either shot. After his first dose he had one day where his blood pressure went very low but by the time he talked to his cardiologist it had gone back to normal and was taking pills, it was under control. Yesterday afternoon he experienced pain in his left wrist, which was the same arm that he received his injection, and describes the pain as not too bad. He states that when he uses his wrist in certain positions, the pain &#34;shoots up.&#34; This morning on the lower part of his left arm (&#34;not the top where I got the injection&#34;) he has &#34;slight pain.&#34; He says this morning his upper arm on the underside where he got it on the left side is swollen. He says he would like to know can it be from vaccine, though maybe he could have strained his wrist, it happened yesterday evening, he had wrist pain and swollen under side of his arm where he got the vaccine injected. He says yesterday late afternoon was the first time, it could be something else, it was the same arm this morning he has a little pain to his upper arm that was not on injection side but below, under it. The patient did not received any treatment, it was not serious pain, it was low level pain, when he uses his wrist and turns it, it comes in more prominent. He says it was not pain that bothers him, if it was not related to the vaccine then he most likely strained his arm.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

On arrival to ED was found to be hypotensive, with elevated WBC count, mildly elevated lactic acid level, and anemic at Hgb 7.5.  An incidental finding of a positive COVID-19 nasal swab was found despite receiving Pfizer COVID vaccinations on 1/30/21 and 2/20/21.  Pt admitted for additional management of sepsis, hypotension potentially secondary to COVID-19 infection and/or RLL developing pneumonia.  Pt currently still hospitalized with worsening acute respiratory failure due to COVID and acute pulmonary embolism.

                                                Vaccine was administered on 1/12/21 at Memory Care. On 1/15/21 at 12:30 he developed slurred speech at his facility and slumped to his left side. Out of concern for stroke he was sent by ambulance to Hospital. There he was found to have no evidence of stroke on MRI or CT angiogram. He was admitted to the hospital due to fever and  elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin, CRP) and transaminases. He was found to have a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG. His symptoms resolved the following morning and may have represented a TIA. He had many markers consistent with COVID-19 and his CT pulmonary angiogram did show ground glass opacities but no pulmonary embolism. It was difficult to assess if this was a reinfection with COVID-19, persistent PCR positivity from November, or an adverse event to the vaccine.

                                                right hand swelling, right knee swelling, right ankle swelling, facial swelling of left cheek Narrative:  Following 1st COVID-19 vaccine dose on 12/17/20, patient seen at Emergency Department on 12/21/20- 12/22/20 for eval of new left cheek swelling and right hand/ankle swelling. Hand x-ray did not show signs of fracture, head CT did not show any signs of new strokes, and labs showed mild BNP elevation. Per ED note, &#34;Based on the patient history, physical, and initial vital signs - the patient&#39;s initial presentation is concerning for heart failure/volume overload-&gt;pulmonary edema and bilateral pedal edema.&#34; He received ipratropium neb x1 and returned to facility. Neurology consulted (12/22/20), &#34;It is difficult to determine whether the patient has a new facial palsy or whether this is recrudescence of his previous stroke deficits. Given the swelling of his left face it is quite possible that there is inflammation causing some partial left facial nerve dysfunction that would not include the forehead. The pattern of weakness is, however, also consistent with what would be expected from his documented right MCA stroke. At this point it is appropriate to consider this a possible complication of his vaccination (Bell&#39;s palsy has been reported in some after Covid19 vaccination). However, I would not recommend any specific treatment for the facial weakness as the etiology is still somewhat unclear.&#34; Patient admitted to hospital 1/2/21-1/8/21 for mild hypothermia with possible AMS and found to have adenovirus. Head CT negative for CVA. Sepsis/toxic/metabolic w/u was unrevealing. Given IVF for diarrhea; C diff negative. Discharged to facility. Patient received 2nd COVID-19 pfizer vaccine on 1/13/21 in Right Deltoid w/o complications (lot#: EK9231, exp. 04/30/2021)

                                                covid shot estimated at Feb 1st between 1-2 PM, first shot, and then had a trip and fall that day. 3-5 days later noted cellulitis on his leg with redness, swelling, pain, edema and went to urgent care on the 10th, given some antibiotics which he is currently taking and the site is looking much better. Patient notes also painless nodules going down his bicep, but not where lymph nodes are (more in the middle of the arm from the site, not near elbow or armpit). Pt also noted some bruising initially at the injection site which is better. Should he still get his second shot even with the abx and cellulitis?  Adv cellulitis on the leg more related to the fall than the shot. The nodules could be from the shot but as they aren&#39;t where I would typically expect to see lymphadenopathy would rec FU with PCP if the nodules persist or worsen. None of this is a contraindication to getting the second dose of the vaccine, but inform the vaccine providers that you are on elliquis so they can be aware to watch for additional bruising/bleeding, which is common after the shot. Discussed also Q518.

Both are still continuing to date.  He has been to his infectious disease doctor, his cardiologist, and to his nephrologist.  Shortness of breath continues.  He has also developed edema in his legs.  His heart condition worsened suddenly after the vaccine.  He will be having a heart procedure on 6/1/21 to address one of the issues.  At this point, there has been no improvement 10 weeks post vaccine.  As I type this report, I am sitting next to him as he helps me with the information and I can hear his breathing which is very labored.

An 88-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6202), intramuscular in left arm, on 25Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included Alzheimer&#39;s and other conditions, but family did not disclose. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications. The patient previously took piroxicam (FELDENE) and experienced allergies. The vaccine was administered in a public health clinic or Veterans administration facility. On 25Feb2021, the patient noticed pain in face in the evening of day he was vaccinated and then the patient developed swelling by the next morning (26Feb2021). On 27Feb2021, the patient&#39;s face was so swollen that his face was weeping serous fluid and family took him to the ER. The swollen cheeks bilaterally progressed to cellulitis (27Feb2021) requiring oral steroids, famotidine (PEPCID), and antibiotics including cefalexin (CEPHALEXIN). The patient remains on steroids and creams to treat swelling and sores. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office or clinic visit and emergency room or department or urgent care. The patient was recovering from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine can not be excluded for the reported event of cellulitis due to temporal relationship.  Case will be re-assessed upon the additional information provided. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Then, on March 28, two weeks after the vaccine, I woke up to a leg severely swollen from toe to hip. I waited two days to see if it went down but it only got worse, swelling to double the size by volume. I went to the doctor and they sent me to the hospital for ultrasound, suspecting a blood clot. No blood clot was evident but there were multi swollen limp nodes in the upper leg area. The problem worsened and two days later I was sent in for a CTscan which now showed multi blood clots near the swollen limp nodes. I was barely able to walk as major pain persisted with no signs of decline. I am now on blood thinner. It has been 2 months since the vacination and my leg is still swollen the same amount (2X by volume).
