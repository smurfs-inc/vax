                                                I would like to start out by saying that I am well aware that this vaccine is known to cause side effects and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any side effects induced by it. The reason I am writing this is to provide information that you all can keep in mind as you provide guidance on your recommendations for the timing of when the vaccine should be administered to those who have already tested positive for COVID. I tested positive for COVID-19 11 days prior to getting vaccinated. My symptoms from the virus began on 12/21/20, lasted until 12/26/20 and included: mild headache, fever of 100.3, moderate muscle fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and sinus congestion. I received the Pfizer vaccine on 1/3/21 at 11am and by 2am on 1/4/21 I was experiencing a temperature of 102.5, severe headache, severe muscle fatigue, and painful right axillary lymphadenopathy. Although they had almost completely resolved by 11am on 1/4/20, I would describe these side effects to the vaccine as significantly worse than the symptoms of the virus itself. As someone who has a stronger medical background than the general public (I am a 4th year dental student in a patient-facing role and was encouraged by my school to receive the vaccine despite already testing positive), I understood the likelihood of developing side effects to the vaccine and I am still planning on receiving my second dose in three weeks despite already showing clear signs of a strong immune response to the proteins created by the vaccine. The reason why I am writing this is because there was no guidance on recommending that I wait longer than 10 days between testing positive and receiving the vaccine and I am worried that if the general public is allowed to receive the vaccine at this same time interval, there will be a significant number of people who will have similar side effects (worse than those induced by the virus itself) and they will not only refuse a second dose, but could also vocally discourage many people from trusting the vaccine?s safety and benefit. I obviously don?t know what minimum timeframe should be recommended, but from my individual experience, 11 days was not sufficient. I will be happy to follow up if you would like to know how the symptoms fare after my second dose.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package. I did experience very bad side affects:  headaches, muscle pains, tiredness, fatigue, weakness, low strength, dizziness, partial blindness, overwhelming stress, back pain, joint pain,  spinal pain, chills, fever like symptoms, nausea, spontaneous  pain, soreness in the arm, swelling throughout my body, difficulty breathing, short breaths.

Noted lymph swelling of my axillary lymph nodes with aching pain.  This has not gone away at current but improved with x1 dose of motrin.

                                                I developed a moderately tender, golf-ball sized left axillary lymph node starting 48 hours after the vaccine, peaking around 72 hours, and lasting until 7 days after the vaccine. The degree of tenderness (3/10 at rest, 6/10 with manipulation) precluded tight clothing and laying on the left side of my body but was tolerable. I monitored it myself and it resolved spontaneously. There was no other LAD noted. I know LAD is one of the known side effects, but I thought this might be a more severe case than usual.

A 30-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: ER8730) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 31Mar2021 15:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroid. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium taken for hypothyroid. The patient previously received tetanus vaccine (6 weeks out from his Covid Vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient stated that his side effects began on 01Apr2021. He noticed tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck. This was the same side of the body he got the vaccine on. His symptoms worsened over the next two days. He had increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck. On Saturday 03Apr2021. it took him a half an hour just to get out of bed. Stated that he went to the Emergency Room at the hospital where he works and they did a series of tests. He had CAT Scans with and without contrast, a MRI, and an Ultrasound. Mentioned later that they also did blood work (Apr2021). The Emergency Room doctor told the caller he was going to have his CAT scan read by a specialist. Caller stated they called him on Sunday 04Apr2021 and said his CAT scan showed an inflammatory infectious process with atypical organisms and Lymphadenopathy. He stated that he read that Lymphadenopathy was a side effect of the vaccine. They told him that the Lymphadenopathy was compressing the nerves in his neck and causing his pain and decreased range of motion. He had been on a week of treatment consisting of pain medications, muscle relaxers, and anti-inflammatory medications. The Infectious Disease was consulted and he was started on a 5 day course of Azithromycin. He was on the third day of this antibiotic per his report. He has a follow up MRI scheduled next Friday. He was calling to report his side effects and also to ask about what he should do in regards to his appointment for his second dose of the vaccination. His symptoms were worsening for the first three days. Since he has been being treated for them they have started to improve slowly day by day. Today he said there was minimal pain and tightness but he was still not back to one hundred percent. He was offered admission to the hospital for pain control after his emergency room visit but he decided to defer it to an outpatient setting. Was not admitted to the hospital. The patient felt that the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; were medically significant and stated they were disabling, at least temporarily. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; was recovering while unknown for the other events. Patient stated that he felt all of his adverse events were caused by the COVID Vaccination he received.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be excluded based on the temporal relationship. Case will be  reassessed if additional information is received. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

                                                I felt numbness in my right leg, the numbness went up to my right arm and then I started slurring. This happened within a few minutes. I laid down and called a  nurse adviser. I was recommended to go to ER, so my wife took me to ER. They did CT scan of my head, then CT scan of my head and neck with contrast, then MRI of my head, then MRI of my head and neck with contrast. It was confirmed that I had an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE. It was decided to perform carotid endarterectomy surgery to remove a clot in the neck carotid artery. The clot was removed.

These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. The patient experienced swelling in left arm/thumb and numbness from tip of thumb to joint on opposite limb of administration.  Since Wednesday, 23Dec2020, he has been experiencing some numbness in the arm opposite of where the vaccine was administered. He clarifies the vaccine was administered in the deltoid of his right arm, and the numbness he is experiencing is in his left hand. His thumb has been partially numb since last Wednesday. He got a little bit of tingling in his left arm since last Wednesday (23Dec2020).The patient explains on Tuesday, 22Dec2020, when he was administered the vaccine he only had typical side effects that went away within 24 hours. He experienced headache and muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was administered. Both of these symptoms went away and he has recovered completely. After 24-36 hours, he noticed numbness on hand opposite of the arm where the vaccine was administered. His thumb has been partially numb which has lasted about 6 days. He clarifies the numbness is on the palm side- which he was told was not related to the nerve. His thumb looks swollen and inflamed compared to the other. He also has noticed muscle weakness in the opposite arm. The patient states he can&#39;t recall if the numbness occurred within 24 hours but he knows by 24 hours, he did have the numbness. His thumb is partially numb on the side of the palm and up to the middle of his thumb where the joint is.Patient states yesterday the numbness was noticeably worse when he was sleeping. However, today the numbness seems to be back where it was before. He forgets about the numbness since he is not actively doing anything with that particular hand, but he doesn&#39;t forget about it completely. The numbness hasn&#39;t improved any, it&#39;s been consistently there and never went away. While reading off of his card, the patient cannot determine if the Lot number is an F or an E because the number is underlined. He thinks it might be an E. Patient was able to confirm the Lot number begins with an E after looking at the information sheet he was provided. He also sees the product number, CVX 208. Patient states he has no allergic reactions and nothing that he knows of that is an underlying condition. Patient states he hasn&#39;t had any testing done in regards to these events. He wanted to talk to the manufacturer and report it to the (Contact center name) first before he schedules something at Urgent Care. He wanted to check and see if what he is experiencing is a lesser known symptom. He couldn&#39;t find this information anywhere. The outcome of events, headache and muscle soreness was recovered on 23Dec2020. The outcome of Numbness in hand was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

This neurologic diagnosis was not reported by the patient during the consent process with the COVID19 vaccination center staff.  Confirmed following review of the consent form.  Documentation from Emergency Department Provider:  Patient is serially reassessed following treatment for anaphylaxis.  Patient has significant improvement in diffuse erythema and hives within 20 minutes.  He has gradual improvement in his sensation of throat swelling.  He is observed while in the emergency department serially over 4 hours with no recurrence of symptoms.  He does not require any repeat dose of epinephrine and feels at baseline.  Discussed my suspicions that patient may have had a reaction to COVID-19 vaccine as he has had no other new medications or exposures that he is aware of.  As he will not be receiving another vaccine there is nothing to necessarily stay away from.  Make sure he notifies individuals about this for any new vaccine should he receive them.  Patient is observed for sufficient time but discussed possibility for biphasic reaction.  Recommend he return should he have recurrence of symptoms.  Recommend he take EpiPen as prescribed for any throat swelling or progressive shortness of breath.  Recommend follow-up with a primary care provider for this visit..

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

                                                About two weeks after first shot, I got shingles. It could be unrelated, but since I&#39;m young, perfectly healthy, not abnormally stressed, and haven&#39;t ever had singles before, I thought there might be a chance it is related. I&#39;ve seen online other young people who are saying that they got shingles after the first shot of Moderna or Pfizer.  Maybe it was just a coincidence, but I figured it was worth reporting. It is overall a pretty mild case because I got on the antiviral drugs pretty quickly. Wondering if I should still get my second shot on schedule or wait until my shingles is all cleared. I have asked my doctor and am awaiting a response. I first noticed the symptoms on Saturday (3/20) exactly two weeks after my first shot.

The next day symptoms continued along with lymph node pain in the right armpit.  All symptoms resolved by day 3 post injection.   Also note, I was symptomatic and tested positive in August with all of the previously stated symptoms except for lymph node pain.  Symptoms post vaccine were much more mild than the actual infection with covid.

Medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. On 28Jan2021 at 07:00, the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes. The patient stated that the lymph nodes were swollen on both sides (or so he thought, as he couldn&#39;t see the uvula at all). The patient stated, &#34;it looks about the same right now&#34;, but the pain (onset: Jan2021) has decreased. The patient stated he had taken several COVID-19 tests prior to the vaccination, on unspecified dates, all negative. The last test, a nasal swab was on Jan2021 with negative results. The clinical outcome of &#34;swollen lymph nodes/lymph nodes are swollen on both sides&#34; and pain was resolving.

                                                I started having radicular tingling with neck flexion that ran down my left leg starting at the beginning of February. I noted it to a colleague and asked if anyone else who had received the vaccine at the same time as me had any similar effects. I was the only person noted. Slowly the tingling increased and began radiating the entire length of the left leg. It only last for a few seconds at the beginning of flexion then completely resolved. I did not think much of this at the time and figured that it would resolve. On February 27, I began having visual disturbances and symptoms similar to vertigo with a severe nystagmus with a gaze the the right. I attempted a round of azithromycin at this time thinking that there may be an ear infection and that was causing my visual/vertigo like symptoms. There was no improvement with this course of treatment and the visual issues were becoming more of a regular issue. It became hard for me to focus anytime that I would look to my right but was able to focus my eyes while looking forward and the the left. At this time, I opted to have a brain MRI done which was completed on Match 9th as well as having basic labs run. I ended up with an elevated white count on my labs with a left shift. My MRI was read the same day showing a demyelinating process. Multiple neurologist were consulted on this and they believe that my symptoms are not related to MS as the radiologist listed as his top three on his differential but rather what they called post-covid vaccine syndrome, similar to what they are seeing with patients who actually had COVID. I have no medical history, I am not taking any medications and had no symptoms prior to the vaccine. My symptoms were acutely brought on unlike MS and I do not have any of the four most common male characteristics of MS. I do not currently have any muscle weakness, I am not fatigued, it has not progressed to my upper extremities, it does not have a stalking glove approach but rather shoots down, I have no sexual dysfunction. I have been started on a high dose prednisone taper as recommended by the neurologist. My biggest concern is that when I looked for information as a medical provider, I was unable to find anything related to neurological issues and the vaccine. Once, I was placed in contact with multiple neurologist, I was told that they are seen quite a few neurological adverse events.

I got a severe reaction from the Pfizer vaccine. I got the normal chills the next day and flu symptoms. From the next day to day 5 I got severe headaches, strong pain in my head, my left arm and left eye. I took Tylenol and ibuprofen within those days. The Tylenol didn&#39;t help at all, ibuprofen 200mg didn&#39;t do much. Yesterday I went to the ER because I had light pressure during the morning in my head not as severe as the other days, in the afternoon I had a tight pressure in my head so I took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol, the headache went away but within an hour I had a bad reaction. My whole body turned red, bumps, itchy. It was bad.  It was bizarre because I&#39;ve never had reaction to Tylenol prior. I never had that before yesterday. It was the first time. They gave me a shot of steroids. The doctor didn&#39;t know if it was a bad reaction to the Pfizer reaction (said it would usually occur within 4 hours of getting the vaccine) or the mix of the Tylenol and the pfizer vaccine together. He had no clue. But he had not seen a reaction of the vaccine at 5 days later. He said I could have reacted late, or the Tylenol and Pfizer vaccine together had a bad reaction.  I had covid late Jan of this year. The vaccine more interaction due to that if I had immunity to it. It was so bad I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to wait 2 months for the 2nd shot. I heard the first dose 80-90 percent immunity or even more. With my body I never had this reaction. Today I&#39;m a whole lot better (day 6). I am too putting too much, should I wait 90 days other say 4 weeks. What to do about the 2nd dose? How about using antihistamines during/after my second dose?

                                                About 2 hours after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine I felt a warm, flushed feeling in my left foot, not unlike stepping in a bucket of warm water. The sensation lasted about 5 seconds and disappeared on its own. Since then, about once per hour I have had the same symptom, with a warm, flushed feeling in my left foot. There is no pain, slight numbness and tingling, but no loss of function or coordination. I can sense that the symptom is about to begin approximately 10 seconds before it starts, because my foot begins to feel swollen. This has occurred about 40-50 times since the injection, and has only gone down slightly in frequency over the past 72 hours, currently it is happening about once every 1.5-2 hours.

Second shot same as above but starting 24 hours after vaccine I developed left axillary pain. Able to palpate a lymph node ~1cm. Very painful on palpation. Has not limited activity but still painful. Was difficult to fall asleep  2 nights after vaccine. Now day 2 after vaccine still hurts, maybe incrementally better but taking ibuprofen. Cannot palpate significant lymphadenopathy otherwise.  No fever. I am a physician.

I took 50mg of Benadryl immediately, but then progressed to hives all over on my, arms, trunk, eyes, ears, and scalp, and legs. Went to the emergency room in case it got worse or obstructed my breathing. In the ER continued to have itching and extreme redness of my arms, with some swelling of my arms as well. About an hour later the Benadryl began working and received prednisone and Pepcid. Stayed in the ER for another hour and my symptoms mostly resolved. Was prescribed 3 days of 40mg prednisone and given an epipen. Have not had issues since then.

For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

                                                blister; fever; chills; body aches; herpes in his mouth; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself). A 35-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1685, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 19Dec2020 10:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Hemophilia A.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. The patient stated that he got his first COVID vaccine, but stated that he has hemophilia A and was worried about getting the second dose. The patient reported that two weeks later after getting the vaccine, on 02Jan2021, he had fever, chills, and body aches. He went to the dentist on 02Jan2021 who told him that he had a herpes in his mouth. The patient stated that it was just a blister. All of these effects have gone away completely now and he has recovered completely. The patient stated that he was able to get the fever under control by 06Jan2021. He was not scheduled to get the second dose yet but stated because he worked at the hospital he can go anytime and get it; he just had not gotten it yet because he wanted to ask about the hemophilia A. Clinical outcome of fever was recovered on 06Jan2021, for chills and body aches was recovered on 04Jan2021, for herpes in mouth was recovered on 15Jan2021, while for the blister was unknown.

I woke up today, 01/12/2021 and had pain and swelling in my right arm pit. I went to my employer&#39;s employee health services and was checked out by a provider. I was told that he didn&#39;t see anything, and he minimized my symptoms. He didn&#39;t seem like he wanted to evaluate me from the time he walked in the exam room. He told me &#34;what do you want us to do? It looks normal.&#34; He then went on to tell them he&#39;s not going to give me time off for work aside from today. I did not ask for any time off once during the evaluation. I recheck my arm pit when I got home, and noticed the swelling is approx. 3&#34;x 3&#34;s. It was not hard to see when I rechecked. I have noticeable pain the swollen area as well. The swelling is visible when I extend my right arm all the way up above my head. I attempted to tell the employee health provider this, but he preferred to check in a manner that does not show the swelling. I am slightly muscular and when my arm is down, you can only feel soft tissue. Employee health gave me Ibuprofen to treat my Sx&#39;s.  I called my primary physician&#39;s office and am waiting for a call back to be either scheduled for an evaluation or receive medical advice.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

While I was changing, I noticed a diffuse maculopapular rash on my torso back thighs and upper arms.  The rash was very pruritic.  I took some Benadryl which did not seem to help the itchiness and made me sleepy.  By Thursday, most of the rash on the torso was gone, but the rash had spread more to my forearms, lower legs, feet and hands.  There was some mild edema of the hands, I had some mild fatigue, and temperature check was slightly elevated around 99 degrees F.   By Friday, most of the rash was gone and I had some remaining itchiness of feet and hands.  Saturday I was back to normal.

At approx. 11:10am (40 minutes after injection) I started to feel tightness in my chest and developed moderate wheezing. I immediately took two puffs of my albuterol sulfate HFA inhaler. The wheezing stopped after I used the inhaler. I did not need to use my epi injector but it was definitely anaphylaxis based on prior experience. I did not report this to the vaccination site as I had already left. It is now 12:45pm and I feel fine.

                                                I had a stage 1b malignant melanoma lesion removed from my right shoulder in 2014 and had completed all required follow-up. About a week after receiving the first dose (left arm), I noticed a small marble-sized lump in my right armpit. The lump continued to grow rapidly and I went to the doctor, after a biopsy and scans it was confirmed to be metastatic melanoma, most likely a recurrence from the 2014 melanoma. I received the second dose on 18 February (left arm) and noticed the lump in my right armpit grew much faster and I had a reaction (swollen nodes) in my left armpit as well. The melanoma is limited to my right armpit. We are reporting the event because of the timing of the melanoma recurrence in conjunction with the vaccination and because the National Institutes of Health is investigating the biopsy/pathology of the tumor in the right axilla as there are features they have never seen before in melanoma.

                                                No history of severe allergic reactions.  Observed for 15 minutes following vaccine injection.  Felt fine at that point so I was told that I could leave.  About 10-15 minutes after leaving (about 25-30 minutes after vaccine injection), I started to feel tingling in the bottom half of my face (most noticeable in the bottom lip and chin area), slight swelling on back sides of tongue, and slight swelling of area under chin at the top of the throat (right side only).  I could still breathe, drink, and talk normally.  Although symptoms did not seem to be intensifying, I decided to seek care at a nearby urgent care out of caution.  I arrived at the urgent care about 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms (about 45 minutes after vaccine injection).  Provider evaluated me, administered pepcid and a Benadryl shot, and notified me that if I went into anaphylactic shock that they would administer an epipen and call an ambulance.  Vitals were normal and remained normal throughout observation.  Symptoms began to abate about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Tongue swelling abated first about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Active tingling in the chin abated about 30 minutes after Benadryl injection, although light numbness remained.  Swelling under chin abated about 45 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Provider or staff checked on me every 15-20 minutes.  Provider released me from observation after about 2 hours.  At that point all symptoms had abated with the exception of slight numbness on bottom half of face, which persisted for several more hours.

A 38-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, lot no. EH9899, expiration date not reported) intramuscular on left arm on 28Dec2020 at a single dose, then second dose (lot no. EK9231, expiry date not reported), intramuscular on right arm on 18Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: penicillin. (no major history of allergic reactions except penicillin as a baby). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient reported that on 11Jan2021 15:00 (03:00 PM) &#34;exactly two weeks after taking the first shot, my body broke out in systematic rash and welts with swelling of face. My doctor thought two weeks was two long of a delay for the reaction to be from the vaccine. My doctor thought it might have been some antibiotics I had been on and they gave me prednisone. The prednisone cleared up the reaction before the second shot. I received the second shot (on 18Jan2021 with lot no. EK9231, intramuscular on right arm) and within two hours I had an even worse systematic allergic reaction that is still on going as of today 04Feb2021. The Prednisone is not clearing up the reaction. I am going to have to take short term disability.&#34; The adverse events resulted to patient had clinic visit, disability or permanent damage.

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Lot Number: ER8732, expiration date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 30Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, rhinitis, allergic to eggs (ongoing). Concomitant medications included calcium since they took out part of parathyroid, levothyroxine for Thyroid removed and calcitriol taken for Better absorption of calcium; and all were ongoing. The patient previously received Tetanus shot on an unspecified date in 2021 (3 weeks to a month prior to getting the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient was calling to report adverse side effects that he experienced 2 days ago on 07Apr2021 after having the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He said that on 07Apr2021, he was taken ill in an ambulance after passing out and vomiting all over himself and his wife. His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.

The patient was evaluated at Urgent Care yesterday and sent by the NP. Patient reports three days of rash to the left side of his face with redness and swelling. The patient initially thought the rash was acne due to his face mask. There is intermittent pain to the area which is rated 10/10 severity at its worst. The patient has been unable to sleep the past two days due to the pain. Pain is worse with cold weather and at night with increased clenching of his jaw and grinding of his teeth. He was prescribed Valtrex at Urgent Care and took one dose just PTA to the ED. There is concern given a bump just lateral to the patient&#39;s left eye. The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccination on 01/18/2021 and explains that the Urgent Care provider believes this may be an adverse reaction.

I went to ER in another location.  ER Dr. advised this is an allergic reaction to the vaccine.
