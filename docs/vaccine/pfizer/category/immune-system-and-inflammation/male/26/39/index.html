                                                A 26-year-old male with no past medical history presents to the emergency department (ED) with an acute episode of chest pain. He reports initially mild dull substernal chest pain for a day prior to an episode of acute sharp chest pain that radiates to his left neck and left shoulder accompanied by diaphoresis leading him to present to the ED. He had received the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine three days prior to presentation and reported myalgia and weakness beginning within 24 hours of vaccination. His blood pressure on arrival was 126/83 mmHg and pulse was 61 bpm. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed diffuse upsloping 2mm STE, no reciprocal changes, and PR elevation in aVR. Troponin-I on admission was 6.03 ng/ml prior to peaking at 21 ng/ml while initial CRP was 56.8 mg/L. Transthoracic echo (TTE) showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55-60% with hypokinesis of the basal lateral wall. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was consistent with myocarditis showing subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the basal inferior wall, no edema on T2 sequences, and a mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with an LVEF of 51%. He was started on colchicine, low dose beta blocker and losartan and improved symptomatically along with resolution of the EKG findings prior to being discharged with plan for close outpatient follow-up and repeat imaging.  In addition, a respiratory viral PCR panel was obtained which was positive for Rhinovirus/Enterovirus on nasal swab. Although it is possible that his presentation was secondary to enteroviral myocarditis, the temporal relationship to the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine suggests the possibility of myocarditis secondary to immunologic response to COVID-19 vaccine itself.

                                                I would like to start out by saying that I am well aware that this vaccine is known to cause side effects and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any side effects induced by it. The reason I am writing this is to provide information that you all can keep in mind as you provide guidance on your recommendations for the timing of when the vaccine should be administered to those who have already tested positive for COVID. I tested positive for COVID-19 11 days prior to getting vaccinated. My symptoms from the virus began on 12/21/20, lasted until 12/26/20 and included: mild headache, fever of 100.3, moderate muscle fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and sinus congestion. I received the Pfizer vaccine on 1/3/21 at 11am and by 2am on 1/4/21 I was experiencing a temperature of 102.5, severe headache, severe muscle fatigue, and painful right axillary lymphadenopathy. Although they had almost completely resolved by 11am on 1/4/20, I would describe these side effects to the vaccine as significantly worse than the symptoms of the virus itself. As someone who has a stronger medical background than the general public (I am a 4th year dental student in a patient-facing role and was encouraged by my school to receive the vaccine despite already testing positive), I understood the likelihood of developing side effects to the vaccine and I am still planning on receiving my second dose in three weeks despite already showing clear signs of a strong immune response to the proteins created by the vaccine. The reason why I am writing this is because there was no guidance on recommending that I wait longer than 10 days between testing positive and receiving the vaccine and I am worried that if the general public is allowed to receive the vaccine at this same time interval, there will be a significant number of people who will have similar side effects (worse than those induced by the virus itself) and they will not only refuse a second dose, but could also vocally discourage many people from trusting the vaccine?s safety and benefit. I obviously don?t know what minimum timeframe should be recommended, but from my individual experience, 11 days was not sufficient. I will be happy to follow up if you would like to know how the symptoms fare after my second dose.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package. I did experience very bad side affects:  headaches, muscle pains, tiredness, fatigue, weakness, low strength, dizziness, partial blindness, overwhelming stress, back pain, joint pain,  spinal pain, chills, fever like symptoms, nausea, spontaneous  pain, soreness in the arm, swelling throughout my body, difficulty breathing, short breaths.

This vaccine is a biological warfare. I&#39;ve been very active in obtaining vaccinations. Flu shots, up to date with tetanus, and obtaining a second Immunization for chicken pox because I actually received the chicken, but had no vaccination. And. I need the vaccination record for school. So I had to get the chicken pox vaccine.  I&#39;ve been having mild, but very uncomfortable and consistent headaches. My sinuses all over my face are so filled. My eyes are watery, turn red, and at time so painful that it&#39;s difficult to open them. I have muscle weakness. I&#39;m always so thirty all the time. My urine smells  like uric acid. Has a rancid toxic smell to it. And. My urine is clear. But smells. My skin feels silky. And. the perspiration from my body, smells like formaldehyde. Smells clean, but smells like toxic formaldehyde and dead sticky body residue.  The most uncomfortable is the partial blindness. Headaches. Muscle aches. Joint aches. Neck pains. Eye pains. The consistent thirst.  I can&#39;t go to the doctor because I don&#39;t have insure. But. Most importantly. I don&#39;t have employment, because of the Government&#39;s illegal employment system that accounts for me. I&#39;ve been unemployed for 6 years. And. Have a private college degree from one of the top Universities in the USA.  Also. I&#39;ve been very active in producing sputum. Flem. My neck is swollen. And parts of my body are swollen. Not severely. But you can see there is minor swelling.  All the symptoms I&#39;m disclosing in this report, are minor. But. When collectively experienced. Is unbarable. Extremely Uncomfortable. And. You&#39;re expecting me to get another dosage of this experience. Being. 2 months incapacitated. This is even illegally distributed. What the hell. In God&#39;s name. Are you people in there doing. And. Why are you people in the Government even able to get away with this.

                                                When I woke up on Sunday, April 11th, 2021 at around 9am, I have felt like my muscles have been ripped apart, I was sweating, I had labored breathing, and I could not get up for the day. I slept all day, feeling like I had the flu, and was sleeping until 7pm that day. I called out of work when I woke up because I knew on Monday I would not be able to make it, as I felt like I was very tired, lethargic, and sore. This feeling was throughout every inch of my body. I also went to take a shower that day and I had a hard time breathing in the shower, to the point where I had to sit on the edge of the tub, just to make sure I would not pass out from lack of oxygen. This was the scariest sickness I have ever had in my entire life. I literally thought I was going to die. Monday came around and I felt even worse, my muscles were sore, I felt extremely tired, I could not do anything, and I was in bed all day. Today is Tuesday, and I have felt a little bit better, but I have missed two days of work because of the effects this vaccine has had on my body. I made a virtual appointment with a doctor on the app on phone and met with Doctor who basically told me that the only thing I could do for myself is take Ibuprofen every 8 hours for the pain and swelling that might occur and drink plenty of gatorade. It is Tuesday, April 13th, 2021 at 11:29pm at night and I still feel the same as Monday, very weak, tired, and sore all over my body. I have never had this with a vaccine before, until I got the COVID-19 one. I have taken the Flu Vaccine, Hep A, Tantnius, Chicken Pox and never felt like I was so tired I could not get out of bed from these vaccines.

                                                Moderate aches experienced on the day following vaccination (5/23) beginning in the morning. Two doses of ibuprofen taken in the morning and afternoon.  Mild pain experienced in left front armpit, nearly on the left pectoral, on the night following vaccination. On the following morning (5/24), moderate swelling was noticed in the left armpit, extending from underneath the armpit down to the upper lat muscles and up along the left pectoral nearly to the nipple up to just below the left collarbone. Mild pain experienced in the left front armpit as well as on the lymph node under the armpit. No inhibition of arm motion or pain when using arm, but some feeling of discomfort and pressure. Tele-med help was sought which did not recommend any course of action. By the afternoon, moderate swelling was noticed on the left arm, on the bicep and tricep down to the elbow. Ibuprofen was taken at ~3pm with no effect. Medical advice was sought at 7pm and it was recommended to head to urgent care, but all providers in the area were closed. By this morning (5/25), the swelling has reduced significantly and localized to the left front armpit. Mild pain remains, now more localized to the lymph node under the left armpit.

                                                After first Pfizer dose, I was just feeling really tired. After the second dose, around that afternoon/evening I started feeling my mouth feeling weird. The next day I saw blisters filled with yellow/whiteish puss in my tongue. I went to the ER later i felt a lump under left shoulder while showering. On 28 MAY 3 AM I suddenly felt my face feeling numb and tingly along with my legs. Mind you I have been in the field emplacing howizters for the past few days in a field exercise. I also jammed my finger on an 80 lb metal bar on 26 MAY and got my finger poked with a hot device that also drained the blood after getting an xray. I called medical ER  at 242 and spoke to Dr.(?) Doctor did not give me his name spelling after I asked for the spelling and he told me that I could always come in to the ER. I told him whether the finger pricking and blooding draining could cause the left facial numbness and legs tingleness. He said no so i am now assuming it is an adverse side effect. I am a smart guy have bachelors in journalism but right now I cannot concentrate and filling out htis form hastily just i case the effects get worse and I have to go to hospital er. Talking to the Dr. (?) was harder than normal and he asked if my breathing was normal, I said i am breathing heavily, which I did not have much control over. He said breathe normally and I will be better from the tingliness. I can write well I am a journalism major but this is hard to write for me . I am also feeling chills and I am also not feeling well. I was able to get this link from my local online meeting and I am glad I can contribute to the research and science in general. I wish the doctor had tested me for possible problems when I had an adverse effect from the first vaccine but the doctor told me to come back if the &#34;viral infection&#34; gets worse after I breathe normal. I did take a PT test and my 2 mile run time increased and it was much harder to run than the 2 mile run. Time went up by at least 3 minutes.

It&#39;s pretty tender when I touch or move my arm abruptly.  From what I&#39;ve researched it seems like a fairly normal reaction, but I still want to report it.  I&#39;ve taken ibuprofen and tried icing it to help with the swelling.

                                                Cognitive -- severe symptoms began ~3 days after Pfizer 2nd dose.  Extreme disorientation and confusion (transient), memory loss (longterm), extreme lethargy - unable to move, intermittant psychosis (mild, esp. when going to sleep), and anxiety (transient but very extreme, unlike anything I&#39;ve felt before, not improved by diazepam)  (continued for 10 days then began to improve dramatically followed by alternating relapse on a daily basis for 4 weeks, up to present -- dramatically and stably improved by steroid treatment, returned after discontinuing)   Nerve pain --  began ~1 week after Pfizer second dose. -- tingling, burning throughout extremities, especially fingertips, toes, hips; transient (usually 5 seconds or less). Progressively became more frequent (20&#43; / day), longer lasting (up to 20 seconds) and more severe (like stabbing or electric shock). Gradually resolved after course of dexamethasone beginning 3 weeks after vaccination.   Sharp inner ear pain -- (both ears) began ~1 week after Pfizer second dose. Rare events (~5x / day), very transient (1-2 seconds) but extremely painful. Continues up to present,  (4 weeks after Pfizer second dose). Also constant popping of both ears beginning week 2 to present, feels like fluid inside.   Adenopathy -- On 4/28/21 noticed massive swelling on left pectoral muscle (contralateral to vaccine injection site), diagnosed as lymphadenopathy, moderately painful. Continued to get worse for 1 week, began dexamethasone on 5/7/21. Dramatically improved, however swelling returned after discontinuing steroid and spread to all lymph nodes, including neck and others. Became extremely painful on 5/14/21, unable to walk due to swelling in inguinal lymph nodes.  Again dramatically improved after steroid injection on 5/16/21.

                                                The following day after the second shot. I had started to get serious pain in the armpit/swollen lymph node. I have had swollen lymph nodes in the past for certain infections so theres a chance I have a predisposition to getting them, but haven&#39;t had an issue in many years. However, I reached out to a friend that works for a company and she said to report this. The deep lymph node in my left armpit is many times larger than the left and I cannot let my arm rest at its side due to the size and pain.

                                                I developed a moderately tender, golf-ball sized left axillary lymph node starting 48 hours after the vaccine, peaking around 72 hours, and lasting until 7 days after the vaccine. The degree of tenderness (3/10 at rest, 6/10 with manipulation) precluded tight clothing and laying on the left side of my body but was tolerable. I monitored it myself and it resolved spontaneously. There was no other LAD noted. I know LAD is one of the known side effects, but I thought this might be a more severe case than usual.

A 30-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: ER8730) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 31Mar2021 15:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroid. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium taken for hypothyroid. The patient previously received tetanus vaccine (6 weeks out from his Covid Vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient stated that his side effects began on 01Apr2021. He noticed tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck. This was the same side of the body he got the vaccine on. His symptoms worsened over the next two days. He had increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck. On Saturday 03Apr2021. it took him a half an hour just to get out of bed. Stated that he went to the Emergency Room at the hospital where he works and they did a series of tests. He had CAT Scans with and without contrast, a MRI, and an Ultrasound. Mentioned later that they also did blood work (Apr2021). The Emergency Room doctor told the caller he was going to have his CAT scan read by a specialist. Caller stated they called him on Sunday 04Apr2021 and said his CAT scan showed an inflammatory infectious process with atypical organisms and Lymphadenopathy. He stated that he read that Lymphadenopathy was a side effect of the vaccine. They told him that the Lymphadenopathy was compressing the nerves in his neck and causing his pain and decreased range of motion. He had been on a week of treatment consisting of pain medications, muscle relaxers, and anti-inflammatory medications. The Infectious Disease was consulted and he was started on a 5 day course of Azithromycin. He was on the third day of this antibiotic per his report. He has a follow up MRI scheduled next Friday. He was calling to report his side effects and also to ask about what he should do in regards to his appointment for his second dose of the vaccination. His symptoms were worsening for the first three days. Since he has been being treated for them they have started to improve slowly day by day. Today he said there was minimal pain and tightness but he was still not back to one hundred percent. He was offered admission to the hospital for pain control after his emergency room visit but he decided to defer it to an outpatient setting. Was not admitted to the hospital. The patient felt that the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; were medically significant and stated they were disabling, at least temporarily. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; was recovering while unknown for the other events. Patient stated that he felt all of his adverse events were caused by the COVID Vaccination he received.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be excluded based on the temporal relationship. Case will be  reassessed if additional information is received. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

No visible change in size or pain level over the past 24 hours.  RN told client that it is not a known SE and that immediate eval is not needed unless his condition changes.   RN advised him to use ice and cold compresses for relief and to outline the area with a marker to allow him to gauge if it increases or decreases in size.   RN advised him to go to a UCC or ED if it suddenly gets larger, fever of over 100.4 develops or pain increases in intensity.    Pt has a phone appointment scheduled with his outside PCP 4/23/21 to discuss his concerns.

                                                I felt numbness in my right leg, the numbness went up to my right arm and then I started slurring. This happened within a few minutes. I laid down and called a  nurse adviser. I was recommended to go to ER, so my wife took me to ER. They did CT scan of my head, then CT scan of my head and neck with contrast, then MRI of my head, then MRI of my head and neck with contrast. It was confirmed that I had an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE. It was decided to perform carotid endarterectomy surgery to remove a clot in the neck carotid artery. The clot was removed.

These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. The patient experienced swelling in left arm/thumb and numbness from tip of thumb to joint on opposite limb of administration.  Since Wednesday, 23Dec2020, he has been experiencing some numbness in the arm opposite of where the vaccine was administered. He clarifies the vaccine was administered in the deltoid of his right arm, and the numbness he is experiencing is in his left hand. His thumb has been partially numb since last Wednesday. He got a little bit of tingling in his left arm since last Wednesday (23Dec2020).The patient explains on Tuesday, 22Dec2020, when he was administered the vaccine he only had typical side effects that went away within 24 hours. He experienced headache and muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was administered. Both of these symptoms went away and he has recovered completely. After 24-36 hours, he noticed numbness on hand opposite of the arm where the vaccine was administered. His thumb has been partially numb which has lasted about 6 days. He clarifies the numbness is on the palm side- which he was told was not related to the nerve. His thumb looks swollen and inflamed compared to the other. He also has noticed muscle weakness in the opposite arm. The patient states he can&#39;t recall if the numbness occurred within 24 hours but he knows by 24 hours, he did have the numbness. His thumb is partially numb on the side of the palm and up to the middle of his thumb where the joint is.Patient states yesterday the numbness was noticeably worse when he was sleeping. However, today the numbness seems to be back where it was before. He forgets about the numbness since he is not actively doing anything with that particular hand, but he doesn&#39;t forget about it completely. The numbness hasn&#39;t improved any, it&#39;s been consistently there and never went away. While reading off of his card, the patient cannot determine if the Lot number is an F or an E because the number is underlined. He thinks it might be an E. Patient was able to confirm the Lot number begins with an E after looking at the information sheet he was provided. He also sees the product number, CVX 208. Patient states he has no allergic reactions and nothing that he knows of that is an underlying condition. Patient states he hasn&#39;t had any testing done in regards to these events. He wanted to talk to the manufacturer and report it to the (Contact center name) first before he schedules something at Urgent Care. He wanted to check and see if what he is experiencing is a lesser known symptom. He couldn&#39;t find this information anywhere. The outcome of events, headache and muscle soreness was recovered on 23Dec2020. The outcome of Numbness in hand was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

This neurologic diagnosis was not reported by the patient during the consent process with the COVID19 vaccination center staff.  Confirmed following review of the consent form.  Documentation from Emergency Department Provider:  Patient is serially reassessed following treatment for anaphylaxis.  Patient has significant improvement in diffuse erythema and hives within 20 minutes.  He has gradual improvement in his sensation of throat swelling.  He is observed while in the emergency department serially over 4 hours with no recurrence of symptoms.  He does not require any repeat dose of epinephrine and feels at baseline.  Discussed my suspicions that patient may have had a reaction to COVID-19 vaccine as he has had no other new medications or exposures that he is aware of.  As he will not be receiving another vaccine there is nothing to necessarily stay away from.  Make sure he notifies individuals about this for any new vaccine should he receive them.  Patient is observed for sufficient time but discussed possibility for biphasic reaction.  Recommend he return should he have recurrence of symptoms.  Recommend he take EpiPen as prescribed for any throat swelling or progressive shortness of breath.  Recommend follow-up with a primary care provider for this visit..

                                                suspected COVID-19; suspected COVID-19; Fatigue; Body aches; Headache; chills; The initial case was missing the following minimum criteria: no adverse event. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

                                                About two weeks after first shot, I got shingles. It could be unrelated, but since I&#39;m young, perfectly healthy, not abnormally stressed, and haven&#39;t ever had singles before, I thought there might be a chance it is related. I&#39;ve seen online other young people who are saying that they got shingles after the first shot of Moderna or Pfizer.  Maybe it was just a coincidence, but I figured it was worth reporting. It is overall a pretty mild case because I got on the antiviral drugs pretty quickly. Wondering if I should still get my second shot on schedule or wait until my shingles is all cleared. I have asked my doctor and am awaiting a response. I first noticed the symptoms on Saturday (3/20) exactly two weeks after my first shot.

                                                Approximately 9 days after injection in left arm, started experiencing symptoms in right armpit consistent with swollen lymph nodes including: intermittent sharp stinging pain similar to ingrown hair or inflamed hair follicle, as well redness and dull pain upon palpation. Over several days, swelling has increased significantly and pain has increased a little as well. Today, 14 days after injection in left arm, starting to experience onset of lymph node swelling in left armpit as well. Additionally, starting 9 days after injection, concomitant with lymph node swelling, I believe I have felt slightly fatigued and have felt 1 degree warmer than usual, though not actually feverish. I confirmed a temperature of 98.9F today around 5:45PM, whereas my normal temperature is about 97.7F when measured by the same method.

                                                Swelling in the neck started a few days after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine.  Its not known if the swelling is related to the vaccine.  Medical exam by primary said my thyroid is a bit full.  Some post nasal drip as well.  Discomfort from the swelling became gradually more significant over several days.  Some tightness when swallowing food.   At this time of year I typically get allergy symptoms of hay fever (sneezing, itch/watery eyes, etc.) but neck swelling has never been a symptom for me.  Started taking Claritin once a day as I usually do this time of year as well.

They would be red and raised, almost like a small mosquito bite. Then they would dissipate, although some would leave a tiny red dot.   Almost seemed that there was a bug in my clothing, so I showered, changed my clothes, and searched thoroughly in bed, closet, clothes for, bugs but there were none. My wife also did not get any of these itchy bumps in spite of sharing a bed.   It may be worth noting that my wife got shingles 10 days after receiving the 1st Pfizer dose.

Medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. On 28Jan2021 at 07:00, the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes. The patient stated that the lymph nodes were swollen on both sides (or so he thought, as he couldn&#39;t see the uvula at all). The patient stated, &#34;it looks about the same right now&#34;, but the pain (onset: Jan2021) has decreased. The patient stated he had taken several COVID-19 tests prior to the vaccination, on unspecified dates, all negative. The last test, a nasal swab was on Jan2021 with negative results. The clinical outcome of &#34;swollen lymph nodes/lymph nodes are swollen on both sides&#34; and pain was resolving.

                                                I started having radicular tingling with neck flexion that ran down my left leg starting at the beginning of February. I noted it to a colleague and asked if anyone else who had received the vaccine at the same time as me had any similar effects. I was the only person noted. Slowly the tingling increased and began radiating the entire length of the left leg. It only last for a few seconds at the beginning of flexion then completely resolved. I did not think much of this at the time and figured that it would resolve. On February 27, I began having visual disturbances and symptoms similar to vertigo with a severe nystagmus with a gaze the the right. I attempted a round of azithromycin at this time thinking that there may be an ear infection and that was causing my visual/vertigo like symptoms. There was no improvement with this course of treatment and the visual issues were becoming more of a regular issue. It became hard for me to focus anytime that I would look to my right but was able to focus my eyes while looking forward and the the left. At this time, I opted to have a brain MRI done which was completed on Match 9th as well as having basic labs run. I ended up with an elevated white count on my labs with a left shift. My MRI was read the same day showing a demyelinating process. Multiple neurologist were consulted on this and they believe that my symptoms are not related to MS as the radiologist listed as his top three on his differential but rather what they called post-covid vaccine syndrome, similar to what they are seeing with patients who actually had COVID. I have no medical history, I am not taking any medications and had no symptoms prior to the vaccine. My symptoms were acutely brought on unlike MS and I do not have any of the four most common male characteristics of MS. I do not currently have any muscle weakness, I am not fatigued, it has not progressed to my upper extremities, it does not have a stalking glove approach but rather shoots down, I have no sexual dysfunction. I have been started on a high dose prednisone taper as recommended by the neurologist. My biggest concern is that when I looked for information as a medical provider, I was unable to find anything related to neurological issues and the vaccine. Once, I was placed in contact with multiple neurologist, I was told that they are seen quite a few neurological adverse events.

The evening of the vaccination, I experienced severe fatigue and tiredness.  I slept 14 hours that night and after waking up, I&#39;m tired and lethargic and my arm still hurts.  I missed work today (Wednesday 3/24/21) due to the pain and fatigue.

                                                I got shingles about one month after the second dose. I had severe pain around my spine and back on Friday (4/23/2021) and by the next morning developed red bumps on the left side of my nose that I at first mistook for acne. They produced a very tiny amount of white liquid secretion. The bumps turned darker and I got a red rash on the left side of my nose. The left side of my face as well as the lymph nodes around my collar area swelled up. By Tuesday morning, it spread to my left eye, so I went to the ER where they started me on two new antibiotics. After none of the antibiotics worked, I started an antiviral (acyclovir) and antiviral eye drops and started to improve. The rash and swelling reduced and no new blisters have formed. The doctor and I both thought it likely I had shingles.

The doctor didn&#39;t know if it was a bad reaction to the Pfizer reaction (said it would usually occur within 4 hours of getting the vaccine) or the mix of the Tylenol and the pfizer vaccine together. He had no clue. But he had not seen a reaction of the vaccine at 5 days later. He said I could have reacted late, or the Tylenol and Pfizer vaccine together had a bad reaction.  I had covid late Jan of this year. The vaccine more interaction due to that if I had immunity to it. It was so bad I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to wait 2 months for the 2nd shot.

Yesterday I went to the ER because I had light pressure during the morning in my head not as severe as the other days, in the afternoon I had a tight pressure in my head so I took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol, the headache went away but within an hour I had a bad reaction. My whole body turned red, bumps, itchy. It was bad.  It was bizarre because I&#39;ve never had reaction to Tylenol prior. I never had that before yesterday. It was the first time. They gave me a shot of steroids. The doctor didn&#39;t know if it was a bad reaction to the Pfizer reaction (said it would usually occur within 4 hours of getting the vaccine) or the mix of the Tylenol and the pfizer vaccine together. He had no clue. But he had not seen a reaction of the vaccine at 5 days later. He said I could have reacted late, or the Tylenol and Pfizer vaccine together had a bad reaction.  I had covid late Jan of this year. The vaccine more interaction due to that if I had immunity to it. It was so bad I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to wait 2 months for the 2nd shot. I heard the first dose 80-90 percent immunity or even more. With my body I never had this reaction. Today I&#39;m a whole lot better (day 6). I am too putting too much, should I wait 90 days other say 4 weeks. What to do about the 2nd dose? How about using antihistamines during/after my second dose? What about Tylenol or Ibuprofen?&#34;  Caller wanted to know about using Tylenol or ibuprofen. Response: Due his reaction informed caller to speak with HCP or allergist regarding this.

Initial: Itching and burning through my neck and shoulders, and swollen lymph nodes in neck and collarbone. I began sweating at night profusely and losing weight. I have had a lot of trouble sleeping. These symptoms continued in 24-48 hour cycles of flare ups until 04/19/2021 but finally seem to be abating. Progression: secondary symptoms appeared over the course of the month such as full body joint soreness, weakness, stiffness, stabbing pains (in the neck, arms, chest, and abdomen), blood pressure spikes, dry/sore throat, dry eyes, difficulty swallowing. Symptoms are similar to arthritis or other autoimmune diseases. Night sweats continue but are lighter. Weight loss continues but slower. Sleeping remains irregular.

                                                As a clinical monitor, I was called over to assess a driver slumped over in his seat. He had just received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine approximately 10 minutes earlier. The passenger (his fiance) said he was acting normal until she heard him grunt and then realized that he was passed out.   While attempting to lay flat, I performed a jaw thrust that yielded a stridulous inspiration but was still unresponsive. He did not have a palpable carotid pulse. Paramedics was summoned emergently. Within 30-45 seconds, he awoke but was confused and amnestic to the event. He had no physical complaints and no significant medical or allergy history.   I auscultated his larynx (no stridor) and his lungs (CTA). His initial vitals: BP 90/51  HR 61  VR 16  SaO2 100% An electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm without ischemic changes or evidence of conduction delay. His glucose was 119.   Over the next 30 minutes, he was able to drink two bottles of water and some orange juice. That said, he still said he &#34;felt off.&#34; Repeat vital signs:  BP 118/62  HR 69  SaO2 100%.    The medics advised him to follow up with his doctor, preferably today. His fiance agreed to drive him to an ED near their home for a more thorough evaluation. I provided her my phone number to provide to the ED for any questions.   His clinical syndrome was consistent with a syncopal episode associated with orthostatic hypotension. Low suspicion for anaphylaxis.

Second shot same as above but starting 24 hours after vaccine I developed left axillary pain. Able to palpate a lymph node ~1cm. Very painful on palpation. Has not limited activity but still painful. Was difficult to fall asleep  2 nights after vaccine. Now day 2 after vaccine still hurts, maybe incrementally better but taking ibuprofen. Cannot palpate significant lymphadenopathy otherwise.  No fever. I am a physician.

                                                About 2 hours after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine I felt a warm, flushed feeling in my left foot, not unlike stepping in a bucket of warm water. The sensation lasted about 5 seconds and disappeared on its own. Since then, about once per hour I have had the same symptom, with a warm, flushed feeling in my left foot. There is no pain, slight numbness and tingling, but no loss of function or coordination. I can sense that the symptom is about to begin approximately 10 seconds before it starts, because my foot begins to feel swollen. This has occurred about 40-50 times since the injection, and has only gone down slightly in frequency over the past 72 hours, currently it is happening about once every 1.5-2 hours.

I took 50mg of Benadryl immediately, but then progressed to hives all over on my, arms, trunk, eyes, ears, and scalp, and legs. Went to the emergency room in case it got worse or obstructed my breathing. In the ER continued to have itching and extreme redness of my arms, with some swelling of my arms as well. About an hour later the Benadryl began working and received prednisone and Pepcid. Stayed in the ER for another hour and my symptoms mostly resolved. Was prescribed 3 days of 40mg prednisone and given an epipen. Have not had issues since then.

For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

A 35-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 21Jan2021 12:00 (at 35 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL9263) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing food allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  After receiving the Covid Vaccine on 21Jan2021, the caller has experienced a lot of adverse side effects that he&#39;s dealing with now almost 3 and a half months later. He has seen numerous doctors as well as specialists. He has a long list of symptoms that occurred at onset. What he is dealing with now is a swollen neck (onset date 21Jan2021), a sore throat (onset date 21Jan2021), tongue discoloration, and just general fatigue (onset date 21Jan2021) and malaise (onset date 21Jan2021). Prior to the shot he was physically healthy. He was running about 20 miles a week. Then he got the shot and his health declined significantly and he is still recovering. When this occurred, caller weighed 165 pounds, and now he weighs 145 pounds. He lost 20 pounds. These events happened after the first dose of the vaccine. He got his vaccine at around noon on 21Jan2021, and by that evening at around 2000 he had a tightness in his throat, felt like his right ear was plugged up, then had pain on the right side of his neck. It all coincided with the same side as the vaccine, which he had in his right arm. He also experienced some pretty severe chills. His throat still feels swollen, probably because of his swollen lymph nodes. Some days it is better and some days it is worse. It is causing constant pressure on his neck. He is not sure if he noticed the swollen lymph nodes the same day as the shot or shortly after.Patient does not currently have neck pain. He should probably mention it started probably a few weeks after the onset of his symptoms. He does not know when it went away. He was getting swollen lymph nodes on his left side as well, and his throat became sore on the left side as well. It went away maybe a few weeks ago. He is not sure when the swollen lymph nodes or the sore throat started. His right ear was plugged and then it affected his left ear and it got plugged up as well. It was to the point where he could barely hear. It was almost like an ear infection when it is completely plugged and there is pressure behind the ear drum. 2 weeks after his right side it started on the left side. It has subsided by this time, but it has not completely gone away, but it is not as bad. Patietnt had the chills for 3 weeks, but they weren&#39;t as severe as the first night. He was just freezing cold and could not get warm. After that night he was still having issues feeling warm and had to keep his bedroom at like 80 degrees constantly. It probably continued for about a month. He doesn&#39;t have chills now, however it evolved into more of a heat intolerance. Whenever he feels to warm he feels more tired and not well overall. It is really odd. It is more heat intolerance he feels is going on. After the first few months it started then he had the opposite. He had a problem getting warm, then after the first month he didn&#39;t tolerate heat too well. He is not sure when the tongue discoloration first started, but he noticed it about a month and a half ago. The general fatigue and malaise started at the beginning with everything else. He did not have the second dose of the vaccine. Caller believes the doctors ran a CBC. He had a complete panel done a few times and nothing concerning presented or stood out to the doctors. They did an ultrasound on the left side of his abdomen to make sure he had no spleen enlargement, and that came back normal. They ran thyroid panels and those came back normal. One thing that came back abnormal that explains more of this but the timing is odd with the vaccine is he came back positive for Mono. He started seeing an ENT specialist, and he believes that getting the vaccine could have caused his immune system to freak out considering his history with allergies. It could have caused the Epstein Mono virus already present to become reactivated. That was kind of his theory on why this could have occurred. All the events caused a visit to Emergency Room. He went to the ER about a week, exactly a week after he had the vaccine that day. He was having trouble swallowing (onset date 28Jan2021) as well as his breathing was becoming a concern (onset date 28Jan2021) for him. He also was just having what felt like anxiety-like symptoms (onset date 28Jan2021), and he has no history of anxiety. If he got the vaccine on 21Jan2021 then this happened around 28Jan2021. He did have another ER visit about a week after that one as well. He started to have severe symptoms similar to the first time he went. He is still having a little bit of an issue swallowing. He attributes that to the swelling in his lymph nodes and neck possibly affecting that. His breathing he does not have problems with so much now. He has more of a constant discomfort in his neck, though it is not affecting his breathing at this point. As far as general anxiety he still has that and it does cause issues. It is causing him to not sleep as a result. His swallowing is better. His breathing was the most severe of the symptoms. Maybe after the first month it began to become less of an issue. He couldn&#39;t say exactly when it went away. It probably went away as a result of the swelling subsiding. To be honest he is not sure. Doctors put the caller on numerous medications as well as a medicine that he continued with. He doesn&#39;t know if his anxiety is better as a result of the medicine helping or if it would be the same if he went off of it. He is not sure. He has had trouble sleeping since this all began. It has been a little better. It could be a result of the medicine that helped. He is really unsure if he was not on the medicine how it would be. Patient visited a Physician Office for all events.No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the events Throat tightness,Sensation of block in ear,Swallowing difficult,Anxiety, Sleep difficult,Hearing reduced was recovering; chills,Swollen lymph nodes,Neck pain,Sore throat was recovered; Tongue discoloration, heat intolerance,Fatigue,Malaise was not recovered; other events was unknown.

I woke up today, 01/12/2021 and had pain and swelling in my right arm pit. I went to my employer&#39;s employee health services and was checked out by a provider. I was told that he didn&#39;t see anything, and he minimized my symptoms. He didn&#39;t seem like he wanted to evaluate me from the time he walked in the exam room. He told me &#34;what do you want us to do? It looks normal.&#34; He then went on to tell them he&#39;s not going to give me time off for work aside from today. I did not ask for any time off once during the evaluation. I recheck my arm pit when I got home, and noticed the swelling is approx. 3&#34;x 3&#34;s. It was not hard to see when I rechecked. I have noticeable pain the swollen area as well. The swelling is visible when I extend my right arm all the way up above my head. I attempted to tell the employee health provider this, but he preferred to check in a manner that does not show the swelling. I am slightly muscular and when my arm is down, you can only feel soft tissue. Employee health gave me Ibuprofen to treat my Sx&#39;s.  I called my primary physician&#39;s office and am waiting for a call back to be either scheduled for an evaluation or receive medical advice.

                                                48 hrs after receiving first dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine I started to feel tension type headaches that were moderate but sometimes can be severe and disabling. These headaches persist daily since the first dose of the vaccine. I still have them today. Duration has been almost two months. No other associated neurologic symptoms at this moment. I dont have any past medical history and never had issues with headaches before. Contacted neurologyst with specialty in headaches for treatment. Labs and MRI without contrast are within normal limits.  I used a series of NSAIDS to see if it helped the pain without success. Also did the Botox treatment, which improved headaches but didnt resolve symptoms.

                                                About an hour after receiving vaccine I had the following take place: Flush skin, sweating (no fever), stiffened muscles in neck and shoulders, tingling / stiff tounge, and enlarged lymph nodes in neck. Started taking over the counter benadryl (every 4 hours) until I could get in to see my doctor. Flush skin and sweating subsided, but stiffened muscles and swollen lymph nodes persist.

                                                Over the days following my first shot on 3-20-2021, I noticed an increased skin sensitivity to irritants including fragrances and lotions that I normally use. Small hives and mild itchiness on the skin began to develop around 4-1-2021. In the days following the second shot on 4-10-2021, the allergic sensitivity to any substance put on the skin became increasingly severe, especially on the left arm where the shot was administered. The left arm became swollen up to 2 times it&#39;s normal size by 04-14-2021 even after no more cosmetics or foreign substances were being applied to the skin. Hives appeared on other parts of the body but nowhere as severe as the left arm. The left arm skin was inflamed , itchy and painful. Swelling became so severe that doctors found it necessary to presribe topical and oral steroids (prednisone). Oral steroids were effective at reducing inflammation.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

About an hour later, I experienced slight swelling under my left eye and cheek. A few minutes after, my throat began to have a scratchy feeling and a slight wheezing which was concerning. As soon as I experienced this feeling, I took one Benadryl immediately. After about a half an hour, the swelling under my eye and cheek gradually went down, my runny nose stopped after a few minutes , and my throat itching stopped after about 15 to 20 minutes. I felt fine afterwards.

While I was changing, I noticed a diffuse maculopapular rash on my torso back thighs and upper arms.  The rash was very pruritic.  I took some Benadryl which did not seem to help the itchiness and made me sleepy.  By Thursday, most of the rash on the torso was gone, but the rash had spread more to my forearms, lower legs, feet and hands.  There was some mild edema of the hands, I had some mild fatigue, and temperature check was slightly elevated around 99 degrees F.   By Friday, most of the rash was gone and I had some remaining itchiness of feet and hands.  Saturday I was back to normal.

At approx. 11:10am (40 minutes after injection) I started to feel tightness in my chest and developed moderate wheezing. I immediately took two puffs of my albuterol sulfate HFA inhaler. The wheezing stopped after I used the inhaler. I did not need to use my epi injector but it was definitely anaphylaxis based on prior experience. I did not report this to the vaccination site as I had already left. It is now 12:45pm and I feel fine.

                                                I had a stage 1b malignant melanoma lesion removed from my right shoulder in 2014 and had completed all required follow-up. About a week after receiving the first dose (left arm), I noticed a small marble-sized lump in my right armpit. The lump continued to grow rapidly and I went to the doctor, after a biopsy and scans it was confirmed to be metastatic melanoma, most likely a recurrence from the 2014 melanoma. I received the second dose on 18 February (left arm) and noticed the lump in my right armpit grew much faster and I had a reaction (swollen nodes) in my left armpit as well. The melanoma is limited to my right armpit. We are reporting the event because of the timing of the melanoma recurrence in conjunction with the vaccination and because the National Institutes of Health is investigating the biopsy/pathology of the tumor in the right axilla as there are features they have never seen before in melanoma.

Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 for COVID-19 immunisation on 29Jan2021 13:00 on left arm and experienced small marble-sized lump in right armpit. The patient stated that, &#34;I had a stage 1b malignant melanoma lesion removed from my right shoulder in 2014 and had completed all required follow-up. About a week after receiving the first dose (left arm), I noticed a small marble-sized lump in my right armpit. The lump continued to grow rapidly and I went to the doctor, after a biopsy and scans it was confirmed to be metastatic melanoma, most likely a recurrence from the 2014 melanoma. I received the second dose on 18 February (left arm) and noticed the lump in my right armpit grew much faster and I had a reaction (swollen nodes) in my left armpit as well. The melanoma is limited to my right armpit. We are reporting the event because of the timing of the melanoma recurrence in conjunction with the vaccination and because the (institute name withheld) is investigating the biopsy/pathology of the tumor in the right axilla as there are features they have never seen before in melanoma.&#34; The adverse event result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures taken as a result of the events included Immunotherapy. No allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events was not resolved.

About 6 months ago, he had a small, pea-sized mobile lump in the area, and it did not bother him. About 3 days ago, that little mass disappeared, and in its place, he had some pain, a slightly larger lump/swelling, and significant tenderness.  He said the pain was severe when he put weight on his leg or puts pressure on the lump.  It was suspected that he had a ganglion cyst that ruptured, and x-ray of the tibia/fibula was performed to evaluate for any bony abnormality.  It was not sure if this is a vaccine related incident. Report for record keeping.

A 37-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8737, expiration date: unknown), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 31Mar2021 at 13:30 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE; dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Right on 28Apr2021 at 13:30 (Lot Number: EW0171) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE (at the age of 37-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing smoker (patient stated probably started smoking 10 years ago and describes himself as a mild smoker, clarified as less than a half of pack or so, a day). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had no prior vaccination and had no AE following prior vaccinations. Patient had no family history. On 23Apr2021 at 17:00, 2.5 to 3 weeks later, after first dose the patient experienced swollen lymph node, neck and underarm, in varying sizes; painful lymph nodes, under arm and neck, lymphadenopathy and patient was Ridiculously tired, exhausted. Patient reported that he had a lymph node on his neck that was the size of an egg and a cluster, more prominent and was getting larger; lymph node in his armpit was about an inch by an inch, he had a node off to the side of a larger node, that was the size of a nickel, and appeared similar to a marble under his skin. Patient stated that in first week he slept a lot, but then the tiredness may be lessened and still exhausted and takes a random nap. Painful nodes have worsened until 26Apr2021. Caller stated that he had seen multiple doctors, including an Urgent Care, and his sister is a doctor. He went to an ear, nose and throat doctor last week and the doctor was scheduling him for a biopsy of the lymph node, and it was assumed that this was a side effect of the vaccine. Patient went to the emergency room on 28Apr2021 for swollen and painful lymph nodes. Events continued after his second vaccine, on 28Apr2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerised tomogram on 29Apr2021: The largest lymph node, measuring 2.3cm by 3.1 cm. Patient also had blood work. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of painful lymph nodes, under arm and neck, lymphadenopathy with Advil and Tylenol have been effective, but he can tell when the medication is wearing off, and it was time for the next dose. The outcome of Fatigue was unknown and other events were not recovered.  Follow up needed, further information has been requested.

                                                I received my second dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, May 18, 2021 at 1:53pm EDT. Many of the &#34;typical&#34; or &#34;expected&#34; side effects commenced about 12 hours later, including chills, night sweats, a slight fever (99.5), and headache and lethargy the following day.   Nothing was particularly off-putting until the afternoon of Wednesday, May 19, 2021, when I noticed small red spots on my legs and feet. A Google search suggested petechiae and enough cause for me to go to a nearby urgent care clinic. The petechiae were present on both legs and feet (and eventually a few spots on my hands), though a little more pronounced on the left side (with one noteworthy cluster on my left leg). I had no apparent gum bleeding or bruising (maybe one bruise, but the urgent care doctor thought it was there beforehand).  The doctor at the urgent care clinic confirmed petechiae and ran stat blood work for return that night. At ~9pm EDT on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, I received a phone call from the urgent care&#39;s centralized lab informing me that my platelet count was 2 (10^3/uL) -- dangerously low, with risk of spontaneous bleeding and in the worst case scenario brain hemorrhage -- and my PTT was 55.6 seconds. They told me to report to an emergency room immediately, the nearest of Medical Center.  The diagnosis was eventually Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). Every physician I&#39;ve encountered has felt that the occurrence one-day post-vaccination points to the vaccine as the cause. (For what it&#39;s worth, I do not think any of the doctors or nurses I encountered had never seen a platelet count so low. Most of them said as much.) My discharge papers officially note as the diagnoses: petechiae, thrombocytopenia, and adverse effect of vaccine.  I have included details related to my platelet count, treatment course, and other figures below (and am happy to provide corroborating information where appropriate). The doctors did not run any d-dimers, PF4 HIT ELISA, or fibrinogen tests, and no imaging was performed, presumably because I did not present with any signs of simultaneous clotting (e.g., TTP or VITT). They&#39;ve also told me that my haptoglobin and hemoglobin levels were normal (see below), which I am told helps support the notion that there was / is no clotting or &#34;red blood cell breakdown.&#34;  Search terms: decreased platelet count, immune thrombocytopenia, ITP, severely low platelet count, low platelets, petechiae, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia, vaccine-induced ITP

                                                No history of severe allergic reactions.  Observed for 15 minutes following vaccine injection.  Felt fine at that point so I was told that I could leave.  About 10-15 minutes after leaving (about 25-30 minutes after vaccine injection), I started to feel tingling in the bottom half of my face (most noticeable in the bottom lip and chin area), slight swelling on back sides of tongue, and slight swelling of area under chin at the top of the throat (right side only).  I could still breathe, drink, and talk normally.  Although symptoms did not seem to be intensifying, I decided to seek care at a nearby urgent care out of caution.  I arrived at the urgent care about 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms (about 45 minutes after vaccine injection).  Provider evaluated me, administered pepcid and a Benadryl shot, and notified me that if I went into anaphylactic shock that they would administer an epipen and call an ambulance.  Vitals were normal and remained normal throughout observation.  Symptoms began to abate about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Tongue swelling abated first about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Active tingling in the chin abated about 30 minutes after Benadryl injection, although light numbness remained.  Swelling under chin abated about 45 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Provider or staff checked on me every 15-20 minutes.  Provider released me from observation after about 2 hours.  At that point all symptoms had abated with the exception of slight numbness on bottom half of face, which persisted for several more hours.

A 38-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, lot no. EH9899, expiration date not reported) intramuscular on left arm on 28Dec2020 at a single dose, then second dose (lot no. EK9231, expiry date not reported), intramuscular on right arm on 18Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: penicillin. (no major history of allergic reactions except penicillin as a baby). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient reported that on 11Jan2021 15:00 (03:00 PM) &#34;exactly two weeks after taking the first shot, my body broke out in systematic rash and welts with swelling of face. My doctor thought two weeks was two long of a delay for the reaction to be from the vaccine. My doctor thought it might have been some antibiotics I had been on and they gave me prednisone. The prednisone cleared up the reaction before the second shot. I received the second shot (on 18Jan2021 with lot no. EK9231, intramuscular on right arm) and within two hours I had an even worse systematic allergic reaction that is still on going as of today 04Feb2021. The Prednisone is not clearing up the reaction. I am going to have to take short term disability.&#34; The adverse events resulted to patient had clinic visit, disability or permanent damage. Patient took prednisone, famotidine, hydroxyzine, and XANAX (because of the prednisone) as treatments. The vaccine was given in the hospital. No other vaccines were given in four weeks.  Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported allergic reaction manifested with &#34;systematic rash and welts with swelling of face&#34; and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

On Saturday, 4/10/21 I started noticing  hive on my upper arms, upper legs and forearms. Took claritan and they disappeared after 4 hours. That night at 9pm they started to show up in different places. In the morning they were on my forearms, knees, body. I took more claritan and went on a 12 mile hike. As I hiked they got worse and then, about 2pm they had disappeared significantly from knees and forearms. Took a shower at the house around 4 and saw hives all along torso, shoulders and upper arms. Took 2 Benadryl?s around 5 and it all seemed to disappear. In the morning, 4/12/21, went to work and saw that hives were only on my hands, and my hands were now swollen too. Perhaps too much sun on my hands, didn?t sunblock them well. Took another Benadryl at 6am, no effect. At work put Benadryl cream on hands, no effect.  At noon, took a claritan no effect. Hives never left hands today. At end of day, some hives traveling up forearms.  Took a Benadryl and crashed for the night. Hands still have hives and swollen. Palms swollen.

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Lot Number: ER8732, expiration date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 30Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, rhinitis, allergic to eggs (ongoing). Concomitant medications included calcium since they took out part of parathyroid, levothyroxine for Thyroid removed and calcitriol taken for Better absorption of calcium; and all were ongoing. The patient previously received Tetanus shot on an unspecified date in 2021 (3 weeks to a month prior to getting the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient was calling to report adverse side effects that he experienced 2 days ago on 07Apr2021 after having the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He said that on 07Apr2021, he was taken ill in an ambulance after passing out and vomiting all over himself and his wife. His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.

                                                On day 2 or 3 of getting the shot, I started feeling a burning sensation in my chest and what felt like my heart. It was about 3 or 4 out of 10 on the pain scale. I also had intermittent tingling sensations, mostly on my cheek to the left of my nose, but also tingling in locations around my body which happened only a couple of times.  My heart beat rapidly. It was similar to the heart palpitations I get when I eat certain foods. It also felt as if my heart was constrained, as if its outer layers were less flexible than usual.  When the symptoms showed up I started following a fairly aggressive anti-inflammatory diet, mainly wheat/cereal and Advil. I spent most of the time  lying in bed facing up, in order to minimize strain on my heart. I had trouble laying on my side, since my chest/heart was sensitive to pressure. I also believe I was more acutely aware of the distribution of blood throughout my body, and laying on my side felt similar to being upside down in that blood was pooling heavily at the bottom, but I may be misremembering the sensation.  I don&#39;t know if I had shortness of breath, since I took care to avoid exertion. Since my heart was beating like crazy, exertion of any kind seemed like a really bad idea.  The symptoms did not change in severity for a couple days. On day 4 or 5 of getting the shot, I felt slightly feverish for about a 10 minute period. During this time, I noticed the burning sensation weakening slightly, and I began feeling a soreness on my chest near my left shoulder, which I believe is a lymph node area.  Each day after, the symptoms and my heart calmed down little by little.  ----  On day 9, I went to the emergency room since I still had heart palpitations and the burning sensation at about a 1/10 pain level. Just sitting upright caused my heart to go into overdrive. The hospital did not find anything out of the ordinary. I was given MAALOX, but the burning sensation was too faint to know if there was any improvement as a result.  Their best theory is that I had costochondritis.  ----  On day 11, after eating dinner I started getting &#34;chronic hiccups&#34;. These last anywhere from 10 minutes to a couple of hours without stopping. I am not sure whether food or drinks cause them. They are short/acute hiccups and happen at an interval of about 10-15 seconds. I have no history of such a thing.  ----  Today is day 12. The symptoms are noticeably better since I visited the hospital, but the burning sensation is still present around what feels like my heart and the hiccups aren&#39;t stopping.  My best theory is that I may have had an infection by the time I got the vaccine. Maybe I had an infection, not necessarily COVID but some related virus, that was kept in check below an immune response threshold until the vaccine came along and led to the immune system burning the whole infection down.

The patient has been unable to sleep the past two days due to the pain. Pain is worse with cold weather and at night with increased clenching of his jaw and grinding of his teeth.

Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours.  Low fever, chills, heavy heart beat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours.  Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours.  At ~4 days since the first shot, the facial numbness, heavy heart beat, and fatigue persisted, though the drooping became less prominent and the other symptoms have largely resolved.  At ~2 weeks since the first shot, the facial numbness has been constant, but varying in intensity, and the left-side facial drooping has returned multiple times.

A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 12:15 (lot number: EN6208) as single dose at the age of 39 years old for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies: minor reaction to iodine CT contrast. Concomitant medications included fish oil, turmeric [curcuma longa rhizome] (TURMERIC), and xantofyl (LUTEIN); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took iodine and experienced allergies (minor reaction to iodine CT contrast). On 11Mar2021 12:45 PM, within an hour of the shot, the patient started feeling dizzy. Intense fatigue and full body aches set in within 3 hours. Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours. Low fever, chills, heavy heartbeat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours. Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours. Facial numbness, heavy heartbeat, and fatigue persist, though drooping has become less pronounced and the other symptoms have largely resolved at 100 hours since the first shot.

                                                Left leg DVT.    I am a nephrologist practicing in my area.  10 days or so  after receiving Pfizer vaccine I started noticing left leg swelling and some redness. I didn&#39;t pay attention to it because I thought this could be a muscle or tendon issues because of my exercise. But the swelling did not go away, however, it decreased overtime with leg elevation, etc but when I checked my leg I found out that I have a DVT.   I am a healthy 39 ( when I received the vaccine but I am 40  now). I don&#39;t smoke. No family history.  I am on a blood thinner now.   I need to report this as I think that it is important to be reported.   I read in the news that a 40 year-old man was diagnosed with DVT after Pfizer vaccine  Please call or email if you need further info

                                                Following morning (Thur) after receiving the vaccine, started feeling numbness on my face and swelling. Called my primary care Dr. to report symptoms. She advised I go to urgent care. I went to urgent care and they checked my blood glucose levels, EKG to check my heart was beating correctly. Urgent care advised I go to ER to get further evaluation done. I went to ER where they evaluated me. Advised this is an allergic reaction to the vaccine and to monitor. The following day (Fri) still felt slight swelling/numbness. Symptoms became worse in the evening called nurse line to explain swelling on my lip and face. Advised to take benadryl then go to ER. I went to ER in another location.  ER Dr. advised this is an allergic reaction to the vaccine.
