                                                Beginning Thursday night, fever onset reached 101. Patient reported extreme fatigue but aches and sore arm made sleeping difficult. By 2 am on Friday, June 11th, vomiting and diarrhea began. Patient was given 200 mg of Tylenol and 25 mg of Benadryl. Arnaca gel was applied to the rash that formed on the vaccine site. The rash was approximately 3 cm wide and 5 cm tall oval shape. It was bright red and painful to touch (like a sunburn). Arm was also swollen from shoulder to elbow. Patient slept from 4 am - 8am on 6/11. All day on 6/11 patient had trouble keeping down fluids (tried water, juice, gatorade, and broth) and patient refused food (tried popsicles, rice, bananas, scrambled eggs, and plain noodles). Patient complained of throbbing pain in left arm. Patient refused to massage the area and would screen in pain and cry with tears if mom touched it at all. Cold packs and warm packs brought no relief. Patient continued to receive Tylenol every four hours. Fever would reach 102-102.5, break with sweats. Patient reported feeling very cold and then very hot. Fever break would last 30 min - 1 hour before climbing again.   Sunday 6/12 continued the same as 6/11. Patient began alternating Advil 200 mg with Tylenol every four hours. Advil didn&#39;t seem to help any more than the Tylenol did.  Parent called consulting nurse and was advised to take patient to urgent care where she received anti-nausea medication.  Monday 6/13 patient continues to have difficulty with food and drink. The phenergan meds help with nausea but make patient so tired, there&#39;s little chance to get patient to eat or drink. Vomiting has stopped but diarrhea continues.

                                                After the second dose she had immediate pain at the injection site and over the next 24 hours she developed: A fever of 101.4 severe abdominal pain and chest pain that made her feel like her heart was being pulled out painful electric shocks down her neck and spine that made her walk hunched over numbness and swelling in the arm she got the shot pain in her fingers and toes that turned white and were ice cold to the touch  Over the next 2.5 months her abdominal, muscle and nerve pain became unbearable plus she developed new symptoms:  Fatigue gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting Eventually she couldn?t even swallow food or liquids without immediately spitting it up. An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

Patient continued to have bloody emesis so presented back to ER where they did CXR which was normal, gave IVF bolus, zofran, repeat CBC with Hgb 12.4 and transferred to another hospital for higher level of care.  At the hospital, Initially made NPO and placed on IV fluids in preparation for possible endoscopy. Repeat labs showed stable hemoglobin compared to outside hospital. GI consulted and determined that hematemesis was most likely due to Mallory Weiss tear. Recommended carafate before meals, chloraseptic spray as needed for sore throat, continuing IV Protonix and IV zofran as needed, and gradually advancing her diet. On HD#3, she had another episode of hematemesis after eating solids. Overnight, tolerated liquids and solids without any further episodes of emesis. Tolerated transition from IV to PO meds and maintained hydration off of IV fluids. Due to symptom improvement, GI did not recommend endoscopy at this time and recommended that she be discharged on 1 week course of carafate, 2 month course of omperazole, and zofran as needed with plans for GI follow-up in 1-2 months. Had another episode of hematemesis at home after discharge. Went back to hospital and admitted again. The patient underwent upper endoscopy which showed no source of upper GI bleed.

                                                Friday, 5/21 around 11:55 she received her first dose.  20 minutes later she complained that it felt like someone punched her in the face, and her left cheek was swelling.  She looked woozy, with her eyes closing, and the nurses laid her down on the floor on a mat.  Her tongue and throat began swelling, and she was having extreme difficulty breathing.  She then could not feel anything from her neck down, like she was paralyzed.  The nurse administered an Epipen and EMS showed up minutes later.  In the ambulance, EMS administered another Epipen, gave her a steroid and Benadryl and rushed her to the hospital.  Once at the ER, she was still having a hard time breathing, and could not feel anything from the waist down and could not move her legs.  She also complained about her spine being in extreme pain around the mid to lower back.  When her symptoms did not resolve, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment.  She had extreme pain in her joints - spine, hips, knees, ankles and toes, if someone tried to move them, she could not move on her own.  She also had tingling and numbness that would travel up and down her body - weakness in her arms and legs.  The medical staff continued with Bendryl - switched to Adderax, and Motrin and steroids (Prednisone?).  She was discharged from the hospital Sunday, 5/23/21 in the afternoon.  This morning (Monday 5/24/21) she is still experiencing back and leg pain, weakness and cannot walk with out assistance and it is extremely painful.

                                                On Sunday 5/23/2021 my daughter woke up to swelling, redness &amp; pain of the 1st metatarsal of her left foot.  One Monday 5/24/21 the swelling and symptoms in that region had resolved however throughout the day her right hand started to swell, become red and hurt.  This  the throughout the thumb and pointer finger region of her right hand.  The swelling and redness  spread further and could be seen on both palms just below the pointer finger as well as the top of her left foot.  A visit to the doctor was completed on Sunday evening 5/24/21.   The provider we saw believes it to be some for of reaction but it couldn&#39;t be determined if it was environmental, antibiotic or vaccine related.  She was given 2 Benadryl 25 mg tablets after the medical appointment.  As of this morning 5/25/21 I administered anther 25 mg Benadryl and instructed her to take a second dose around 11am at school.   She is reporting there is still swelling in her hand but it doesn&#39;t hurt as bad as it did yesterday.  Her PCP contacted my via phone today and is discussing her case with pediatric rheumatology as she also feels it could be a sign of allergic reaction but since much of the swelling is near joints she has reached out to them and I am waiting to hear back.

Then, on Thursday, May 27th she had a swollen and painful armpit on the arm that the injection was in.  The pediatrician thought it was probably swollen lymph nodes, but just did a teleconference with her, so she didn&#39;t see the swollen armpit. Patient took ibuprofen for the pain and swelling, put heat compresses on it occasionally, but it still stayed that way for All of Thursday and through the weekend.  The swelling began to go down on Monday, May 31.  Then on the morning of June 1 she had a sore throat, later developing a fever, headache, and congestion that lasted two days.  She is a bit improved today, June 3rd, just still congested and has a cough but all other symptoms are gone.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

Caller said that her daughter was also complaining of numbness and tingling all over. She also started to complain about extreme pain in her back. When they would touch her hips, toes, spine, ankles, and knees she would complain of extreme pain, like joint pain. Her daughter had numbness from waist down. If they touched her foot she could not feel it. Her daughter was admitted to the hospital and got released yesterday 23May2021. She is still experiencing pain and numbness. The numbness is from the waist down and the tingling was up and down her arms. She said that her daughter was very weak and could not feed herself. They had to give her several albuterol breathing treatments in the hospital because her chest was tight. She was not wheezing, but they could tell it was constricted and treated her with Albuterol.  She said that her daughter still cannot walk without assistance this morning. She was treated with Motrin, Benadryl and Atarax, and Prednisone in the hospital. The caller said that her daughter also complained about itching all over and in her throat. The caller said that her daughter did not have a rash though.

                                                On the outset: There is no proven link of the vaccine with what happened, but I am filling this just in case you see a pattern emerge: She was vaccinated (pfizer, 1st dose) on Saturday, May 15 2021. A couple of hours later she started experiencing mild symptoms (moderate headache, which we thought as a normal reaction). These persisted on and off  until Wednesday, May 19th, when patient started having swollen and painful glands at the back of her mouth. Long story short, after testing first for strep, followed by blood work, patient&#39;s blood test came back positive with mono on Monday, May 24. The reason for this report is that I have read that mRNA vaccines, great as they may be, may trigger a virus response for viruses that stay within a person - like shingles or herpes etc. The way I understand it, mono also stays with a person. Patient had never been diagnosed with mono before, but mono sometimes does not have symptoms. So, is it possible that she had mono sometime before the vaccine, and it got re-triggered  due to the vaccine? Again, just in case you see a pattern, I am just reporting if helpful. Patient also developed  a mono rash on Wednesday, May 26; treated with topical benadryl cream.

                                                She was not feeling well when she got up on Saturday morning. We went to the neighbors house and were outside for maybe 15 minutes (it was a warm day) when she passed out momentarily. We immediately got her some water and got her in the AC and she did fine since then. She did have mild finger swelling on the distal joint of both index fingers after the first injection on 5/14/2021(same lot #). We are not sure if the finger swelling was related to the vaccine. It started about 5 days after first vaccine.

                                                I have pictures I can upload. She had severe hives - flat, red rash on legs and arms. Very itchy; swollen ankles and swollen wrists and hands. She could barely  move her feet they were so swollen. That happened within 12 hours. And at the doctor&#39;s appt online, she said to give her a double dose an antihistamine - I think it was Zyrtec - and Benadryl at night and to be on Cortosteriod cream on the swollen parts. We did that for about three or four days until it was bearable and it stopped. About three days after it stopped  and she wasn&#39;t taking meds she had another break out - it almost looked  more like blisters - on torso and on arm. We did the same treatment with meds and cream and it went away within 24 hours. I showed to Pharmacist and the Pharmacist said to give an extra week for the next dose of vaccine to give body a chance to rest.

Parent reported compliance with medication but reported that patient started to have coughing fits and fever of 104 at home. This prompted ER evaluation and subsequently admitted to hospital for observation. During admission, patient was treated with IV Ceftriaxone x 3 days and PRN Mucinex for pneumonia. No oxygen requirements, so no further intervention was needed per MD.

She started to have an incredible amount of drooling and could not swallow. She then started to have epigastric cramping and sharp abdominal pain that moved into the right lower quadrant. She had pretty severe headache that started the same time as numbness and drooling with photosensitivity. No fever. No vomiting but she was nauseous.  she went to the ER late on 6/13.  She was then transferred to the hospital for furthur care. She had a neurology consult that thought perhaps her headache, numbness and drooling could have been an atypical migraine-this resolved as of 6/14.  Her abdominal pain resolved after appendectomy and now she just has muscular pain related to surgery.

                                                6/19/21 patient awoke with non-bloody, bright green emesis and abdominal pain. She endorses several episodes of nonbloody diarrhea with continued abdominal pain.  She endorses starting her menstrual period 3 days ago. Mom endorses fever at this time, T-max 102.9.  Presented to an urgent care for further evaluation where they obtained a rapid strep test and COVID-19 swab that were both negative. 6/21/21 she presented to an ED for continued and worsening symptoms.  She received a dose of antibiotics and saline boluses during transfer to another hospital.  In route, she became hypotensive with minimal response to fluid resuscitation. She required vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. A CT of the abdomen showed nonspecific findings for enterocolitis.  A urinalysis had 5-15 RBCs and 51-100 WBCs. She was started on antibiotics. She required ICU admission initially, but improved and became hemodynamically stable after about 16 hours in the PICU. Her urine culture grew 3 different organisms with low colony counts so antibiotics were discontinued on 6/22/21. An ECHO demonstrated normal biventricular size and systolic function (LFEF 62%), mild tricuspid regurgitation estimating mildly elevated RV pressure (30-40% systemic), mild flow accelration across normal appearing trileaflet aortic valve and borderline small aortic root and sinotubular junction, normal ascending aorta, no pericardial effusion, normal right, left main, and LAD coronary artery diameter z-score, and mild outpouching in the left main coronary artery that may represent an early appearance of an aneurysm. A repeat ECHO the following day revealed normal biventricular size and systolic function, mild tricuspid regurgitation estimating RV systolic pressure of 30mmHg, left main coronary artery appears slightly prominent but measures within normal limits. LMCA measurement is similar to previous, normal measurement of the proximal RCA and LAD, and trivial pericardial effusion. The patient also had an elevated CRP of 18.8 mg/dL, fibrinogen of 408 mg/dL, d-dimer of 0.98, and nt-pro BNP of 309. SARS CoV2 IgG was positive and IgM was negative. She received IVIG 100 gm on 6/23/21 and was started on rivaroxaban. CRP decreased to 8.2 mg/dL on 6/23/21.

On June 5th, 2021, Patient experienced fever, fatigue, weakness, and swollen lymph nodes. On June 6th, 2021, Patient continued to have these same symptoms in addition to a break out of several painful genital laisons .  Patient and myself were unaware at this time the sores were laisons, and thought them only to be pimples.  On June 8th when Patient b came very upset because of the pain she was experiencing, I looked at the sores and made an appointment to see her pediatrician right away. Patient visited her pediatrician to have the genital laisons examined on June 8th 2021.  Because the laisons resemble genital herpes sores, they were tested for genital herpes. The test result came out negative. Patient was prescribed antiviral oral medication and topical steroid creams. She continues to take them and still has the sores.

                                                After 10 minutes of vaccination, patient reported to pharmacy that she was not feeling good and assume that her neck was swollen. I check the neck area, no swelling, and asked if she was breathing fine, and patient was ok. I offered to give epi pen in case she is allergic to any, but refused. EMS showed 2 minutes later and took over.
