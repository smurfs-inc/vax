                                                Friday, 5/21 around 11:55 she received her first dose.  20 minutes later she complained that it felt like someone punched her in the face, and her left cheek was swelling.  She looked woozy, with her eyes closing, and the nurses laid her down on the floor on a mat.  Her tongue and throat began swelling, and she was having extreme difficulty breathing.  She then could not feel anything from her neck down, like she was paralyzed.  The nurse administered an Epipen and EMS showed up minutes later.  In the ambulance, EMS administered another Epipen, gave her a steroid and Benadryl and rushed her to the hospital.  Once at the ER, she was still having a hard time breathing, and could not feel anything from the waist down and could not move her legs.  She also complained about her spine being in extreme pain around the mid to lower back.  When her symptoms did not resolve, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment.  She had extreme pain in her joints - spine, hips, knees, ankles and toes, if someone tried to move them, she could not move on her own.  She also had tingling and numbness that would travel up and down her body - weakness in her arms and legs.  The medical staff continued with Bendryl - switched to Adderax, and Motrin and steroids (Prednisone?).  She was discharged from the hospital Sunday, 5/23/21 in the afternoon.  This morning (Monday 5/24/21) she is still experiencing back and leg pain, weakness and cannot walk with out assistance and it is extremely painful.

                                                On Sunday 5/23/2021 my daughter woke up to swelling, redness &amp; pain of the 1st metatarsal of her left foot.  One Monday 5/24/21 the swelling and symptoms in that region had resolved however throughout the day her right hand started to swell, become red and hurt.  This  the throughout the thumb and pointer finger region of her right hand.  The swelling and redness  spread further and could be seen on both palms just below the pointer finger as well as the top of her left foot.  A visit to the doctor was completed on Sunday evening 5/24/21.   The provider we saw believes it to be some for of reaction but it couldn&#39;t be determined if it was environmental, antibiotic or vaccine related.  She was given 2 Benadryl 25 mg tablets after the medical appointment.  As of this morning 5/25/21 I administered anther 25 mg Benadryl and instructed her to take a second dose around 11am at school.   She is reporting there is still swelling in her hand but it doesn&#39;t hurt as bad as it did yesterday.  Her PCP contacted my via phone today and is discussing her case with pediatric rheumatology as she also feels it could be a sign of allergic reaction but since much of the swelling is near joints she has reached out to them and I am waiting to hear back.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

                                                On the outset: There is no proven link of the vaccine with what happened, but I am filling this just in case you see a pattern emerge: She was vaccinated (pfizer, 1st dose) on Saturday, May 15 2021. A couple of hours later she started experiencing mild symptoms (moderate headache, which we thought as a normal reaction). These persisted on and off  until Wednesday, May 19th, when patient started having swollen and painful glands at the back of her mouth. Long story short, after testing first for strep, followed by blood work, patient&#39;s blood test came back positive with mono on Monday, May 24. The reason for this report is that I have read that mRNA vaccines, great as they may be, may trigger a virus response for viruses that stay within a person - like shingles or herpes etc. The way I understand it, mono also stays with a person. Patient had never been diagnosed with mono before, but mono sometimes does not have symptoms. So, is it possible that she had mono sometime before the vaccine, and it got re-triggered  due to the vaccine? Again, just in case you see a pattern, I am just reporting if helpful. Patient also developed  a mono rash on Wednesday, May 26; treated with topical benadryl cream.

                                                She was not feeling well when she got up on Saturday morning. We went to the neighbors house and were outside for maybe 15 minutes (it was a warm day) when she passed out momentarily. We immediately got her some water and got her in the AC and she did fine since then. She did have mild finger swelling on the distal joint of both index fingers after the first injection on 5/14/2021(same lot #). We are not sure if the finger swelling was related to the vaccine. It started about 5 days after first vaccine.

                                                I have pictures I can upload. She had severe hives - flat, red rash on legs and arms. Very itchy; swollen ankles and swollen wrists and hands. She could barely  move her feet they were so swollen. That happened within 12 hours. And at the doctor&#39;s appt online, she said to give her a double dose an antihistamine - I think it was Zyrtec - and Benadryl at night and to be on Cortosteriod cream on the swollen parts. We did that for about three or four days until it was bearable and it stopped. About three days after it stopped  and she wasn&#39;t taking meds she had another break out - it almost looked  more like blisters - on torso and on arm. We did the same treatment with meds and cream and it went away within 24 hours. I showed to Pharmacist and the Pharmacist said to give an extra week for the next dose of vaccine to give body a chance to rest.

Parent reported compliance with medication but reported that patient started to have coughing fits and fever of 104 at home. This prompted ER evaluation and subsequently admitted to hospital for observation. During admission, patient was treated with IV Ceftriaxone x 3 days and PRN Mucinex for pneumonia. No oxygen requirements, so no further intervention was needed per MD.
