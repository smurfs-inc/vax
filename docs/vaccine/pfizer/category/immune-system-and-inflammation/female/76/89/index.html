Swelling of the right side of my face started within a few hours later.  Called Drs. , He recommended taking Tylenol.  (Second Day) Next day, felt short of breath, weak, applied ice packs to my face. Third day, felt weak.  By the fourth day, swelling and itching subsided; but skin on my face felt gritty under the skin. Drove me to the doctor&#39;s office the third day.  I was short of breath walking from the car to the door to the doctor&#39;s office.  I was wearing my mask.  I saw a PA; but, she didn&#39;t tell me much of anything.  I don&#39;t think she knew what to say.

                                                Approximately 1 hour after the shot, I raised a hive on my upper lip.  It very quickly (within 2 minutes) got to its maximum size.  Not noticeably swollen to an observer, but it felt swollen, red and throbbing. It was not a serious adverse reaction.  After about an hour, it was NOT going away, but it was NOT getting worse.  I never experienced trouble breathing. The office where I had the shot is &#34;not available&#34; on Friday afternoon, and my personal physician is not in the office on Friday.  I was advised by another doctor friend to take benadryl, which I did.  While looking at the CDC website, he also advised me that (having had this reaction) I should not receive the second shot.

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in 18Jan2021 at 15:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reporting on the COVID vaccine and who explained that she had a reaction to the vaccine. She had the vaccine yesterday (18Jan2021) about 03:30 in the afternoon and by the time she got home, within the hour, her lips tingled and she felt funny, and her eye lids tender. There was no one to call by that time and she did not think it was severe enough to go to the ER so she just took a Benadryl and went to bed. The patient woke up and her face was swollen more than before (onset reported as Jan2021). She doesn&#39;t think she is at the stage of life threatening, she can still breath, but doesn&#39;t know what to do at this point. Should she take more Benadryl or contact her healthcare provider. The patient asked if this makes her ineligible for the second dose. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

She said it does not hurt, but just feels kind of heavy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: EN5318), intramuscular on 25Jan2021 08:30 at single dose in the right arm for Prevention. Medical history included diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago, acid reflux and cholesterol, all on unknown dates. Concomitant medication included esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) taking for 10 years for Acid Reflux, ongoing metformin for diabetes, &#34;Sarxigo&#34; taking for about 3 years for diabetes and unspecified cholesterol medication. On 26Jan2021 09:30, the patient experienced arm swollen and turned red 3 inches above and below injection site. She said it does not hurt, but just feels kind of heavy. The flu shot did that to her too, but not as bad. Flu shot turned her arm red this year also. She got it in Oct2020. She also got in the right arm in the muscle. She would like to know if she will she be safe to take second dose of BNT162B2. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

During night, could not turn over in bed without pain. This lasted for 3-4 days. Treated with Advil. Next symptoms were joint pains and stiffness and back pains, which also lasted about a week. Treated with Aleve and hot/cold compresses. Final symptoms are severe swelling and stiffness of hands and fingers, with cracked, peeling skin. I have had this for about a week now and it is not improving. Cannot grasp anything with either hand. Middle and index fingers on both hands useless.

                                                her face got swollen something like that; This is a spontaneous report. A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included tooth canal/a tooth it&#39;s going bad on Jan2021. Concomitant medication included celecoxib (CELEBREX), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). The patient took the first vaccine and what happened is that she had a tooth canal then right after. The first dose happened on the 16Jan2021 which is last Saturday then after that it seems that the effect that her face got swollen something like that on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient stated, &#34;Yes, but it has nothing to do with the vaccine or an allergic reaction. It&#39;s just a tooth it&#39;s going bad. So I needed to go to the dentist and probably get an antibiotic (Unspecified medication captured as suspect) for it but I wanted to make sure that&#39;s not going to negate the strings of my vaccine. I didn&#39;t know what it would do to that. No, it&#39;s not because of the vaccine. I had actually had it X-rayed on the 13th and he didn&#39;t see anything that looked bad but it&#39;s gotten worse and it has pores, two pores it has nothing to do with the vaccine. I just I am concern about getting an antibiotic because I don&#39;t want it to affect my vaccine. As I said before the vaccine has nothing to do with my problem.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included X-ray: didn&#39;t see anything that looked bad but it&#39;s gotten worse and it has pores, two pores on 13Jan2021. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Face swelling is not related to the vaccine use but due to the underlying tooth canal issue.

She has been taking Tylenol.  She felt a little relief of the pain with the Tylenol.  She rested all day yesterday.  She left at 10:00 for her bridge club and that&#39;s where she noticed the reaction and has gotten home around 3:00 and not feeling well.  They told her to call us as they did not have any side effects from the vaccine.   She does have an appointment on 3/11/21 with her PCP.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 08Mar2021 15:30 (3:30 PM) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hashimottos (reported as hoshimottos) Diagnosed 35 years ago, hypermobile Diagnosed 20 years ago, and disorder nomia Diagnosed 25 years ago; all unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); diazepam (VALIUM); and levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 on 15Feb2021 for covid-19 immunization first dose at the left arm and experienced immobile for a day, cannot walk, weakness and sore arm. The patient was to know if there is going to be a booster for the Pfizer covid vaccine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer covid vaccine both doses and she is calling to report the reaction she had with the first and second dose to help other patients, she said she was close to death after the second dose. In the middle of the night she was awaken due to excruciating pain in the body, like truck ran over her. The patient heard that someone had same reaction who was in the hospital, with similar symptoms to covid. She said she felt like if her internal organ were shutting down. She does not do well with the antibiotic, and does not go to the doctors. She could not walk or eat after the second dose. She said she has hashimoto dysautonomia hypermobility. she said she thinks she might have had anaphylactic reaction. The patient added that she has lived through it and her experience has been very unusual. The caller has underlying conditions that may have caused this event, she received the second dose on 08Mar2021, it was a horrible experience but since she is still alive she would want to report it. The caller does have strange reactions to chemicals and she typically goes to naturopaths and holistic doctors because of this. The caller also has multiple autoimmune disorders and feels like that may have played a part in this reaction. It was added that further added that she received her second dose 08Mar2021 at 3:30pm and had a little bit of a sore arm, she was thinking positive thoughts about all of this because she never gets vaccines. At 2:00am on 09Mar2021 the caller was awaken in excruciating pain, every surgery she has had or accident manifests in the greatest pain. The pain was excruciating the caller took over the counter pain medicine and diclofenac and it didn&#39;t help. The caller is unsure of what she took, she may be making this up. The caller felt like she was dying, she felt like her internal organs were shutting down, it happened all week. The caller was so weak her husband fed her and made sure she was drinking. The caller thinks she would die if she had to have a booster shot of this vaccine. The caller has never had anaphylactic shock, could this have been anaphylactic shock? All of the pain from a surgery all occurred at once and her entire body was wrecking, in horrible pain, that she does not think heroin could have taken care of. After the second vaccine she was literally so weak that she felt like all of her vital organs were shutting down and it lasted for 6 days, like she got hit by a truck, like had beat her up. The caller knows that there are new found reactions with (Company name) and they stopped thousands of doses because of it, she saw this in the news today. The patient wanted to make note that she has underlying autoimmune diseases, she is unsure if there is a correlation between this and her reaction. The caller was changing from her thyroid medicine and her thyroid went very high with the generic brand so she was swapped to Synthroid in the middle of this. The caller was on levothyroxine and it wasn&#39;t working, her thyroid was sky high (Unknown lot number and expiration date Feb2022). The caller was going through all of these changes as well when she received the vaccine. The caller&#39;s doctor took a test and the caller has antibodies and they are there but not very strong. The caller doesn&#39;t want to be spreading something because she is feeling healthy and fine today. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I was vaccinated with Pfizer for the first time 11 days ago. Within a few minutes of being vaccinated, I felt nauseated but I did NOT throw up. I have been sick ever since with one thing and another. For the first several days after being vaccinated, I had a sore arm, which I expected. I have also experienced extreme fatigue, chills, nausea, muscle and joint aches, a sore throat (briefly), an occasional headache, tenderness in my left armpit and along the left side of my rib cage, stomach pain and diarrhea and at times, a low-grade fever and sweating. My memory and ability to focus on my work have been affected. Yesterday (March 13), I felt OK all day and thought I was better at last, but after I ate dinner, I vomited and had diarrhea. I told my primary care physician about all of this in an email and she replied that my symptoms were &#34;normal.&#34; I&#39;m not so sure. I haven&#39;t read of anyone else feeling so sick for so long after the first dose of Pfizer.

By 3/20/2021, rash had progressed further down her legs, so patient returned to the ER. Rash was only on the arms and legs, and was NOT on torso or chest. No itching, no SOB, no lip/tongue swelling, no fever. In ER, patient was instructed to continue benadryl and was given medrol dose pack, which she was encouraged NOT to take. Patient discharged from ER and returned home. On 3/21/21, new lesions were still appearing, and patient was told to visit PCP on 3/22/2021. On 3/22/2021, patient noticed her left hand was swelling, so medrol dose pack was started. Patient had dramatic improvement in rash and swelling with 24 hours of steroids.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

One day after her second dose of Pfizer vaccine (lot # EN6201) on 2/20, which she received in her left arm, she developed sudden acute edema in her right foot and leg.  She was seen on 2/22 by a nurse practitioner and had ultrasounds of her right arm and right leg.  The ultrasounds ruled out  DVTs  and/or vascular abnormalities.  Her physician concluded that her edema is an adverse effect of the Pfizer vaccine.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249, expiration date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on her left arm on 30Jan2021 to 30Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took phenytoin sodium (DILANTIN) and carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) and experienced allergy as her reaction to those were sometime between 2010 and 2012. On 30Jan2021 after three and a half hours, the patient felt sensation at her foot for that she could not walk, experienced chills, hands were shaking, had a swollen ankle and foot and pain. Around 5 o clock, the patient stated that it was like a strange sensation in her foot and she also got chills. By 7 o clock, she was in pain. The patient stated that she took two Tylenol. The patient stated that at around 9 o clock, she noticed that her ankle and foot were swollen with red blotches on it so she took two Benadryl and then slept until noon. The patient stated that Benadryl actually gave her some relief, although the pain didn&#39;t completely subside, but it subsided a little so that it was more tolerable. The patient stated that she had been debating if she should have gone to the emergency room (ER), but she didn&#39;t because she has a high pain tolerance. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 80-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284) on left arm, intramuscular on 02Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pancreatic cancer stage IV metastasized, blood pressure (abnormal) and chemo. Concomitant medication included pancreatin (CREON) for pancreatic enzymes. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 12Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had a side effect and it&#39;s so weird, she was a cancer patient she was in (city, state) and she had her first Covid vaccine on 12Jan2021 and she had her second one on 02Feb2021 and not a reaction until yesterday (06Feb2021) her left arm got a red rash, all the way up and down her shoulder to mid way between her elbow and hand and some swelling and she just wanted to make sure. She did look at the sheet and it does say you can get a rash, she has no temperature and she wanted to make sure that&#39;s a part of it all. When clarified if the retired registered nurse wanted to if it was the side effects from Covid vaccine, she stated, she guessed so because she got it on Tuesday and her arm hurt a little bit (Feb2021) but no rash showed up until yesterday which was Saturday. The patient had blood work done last Monday on 01Feb2021 with unknown results. The patient reported that she knows her white count was low (unspecified date) because they could give her chemo, so she actually has blood work on Monday 01Feb2021. Treatment was not received and patient stated, it just showed up yesterday and her nurse told her not to put anything on it. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were.

A 81-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL8982) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 20Jan2021 mid-afternoon at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation diagnosed about 25 years ago, Canker sore on 18Jan2021 (she did go the doctor for that and the doctor urged her to rinse it with salt water to she&#39;s been doing that), some soreness in her month on 18Jan2021, gout reaction. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. No Pfizer vaccine was administered on the same date. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. The patient got a reaction that she thought should be noted. She has had a very slight history of gout. She woke up this morning on 21Jan2021 and her big toes hurt. She knew that this was a symptom of what she had had in the past which was gout. The patient confirmed her big toes hurting was pretty much staying the same. It&#39;s not that uncomfortable. She knew from past experience that this was what happens, like when she ate certain foods like seafood or whatever, she would have this kind of gout reaction. This morning on 21Jan2021, she also felt the glands in her neck on the right side were swollen. The swelling seemed to have gone down. Her army was also very sore. She stated the soreness began last night, in the evening on 20Jan2021. The soreness had pretty much stayed the same. She expected the soreness, but she didn&#39;t expect her toes to hurt. It was important to note &#34;she is able to able the gout&#34;. She had only had gout really bad time once and then she&#39;s had a little bit every so often. The gout just seems to be connected to the vaccine- she could not say nothing that she ate would indicate other wise. The events did not require visit Emergency Room or Physician Office. She had an appointment for 10Feb2021 to get the second COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of event glands in her neck on the right side swollen was recovering, outcome of events was not recovered.

An 81-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid, on 16Jan2021 (also reported as 15Jan2021), at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization.

                                                As I washed up in the morning, about 8 a.m., I noticed my underarm was sore.  As I examined the area several times during the next couple of hours I noticed a lump.  The lump was moveable, but seemed about the size of a nickle.  It scared me even though it was not actually in my breast.  The doctor told me since it was moveable and felt smooth he thought it to be a reaction to the Covid vaccine, but ordered a mammogram.  I called for the mammogram and was told I could not have one until 4 weeks after the 2nd shot.  I have a mammogram scheduled 3/26/2021.

Day after, Saturday, itching intensified, throat tightened (muscular feeling); and tongue began to become sore, and began to show redness on sides.  Bad enough that I finally took a 4-6 hour dose of Benadryl, and slept afternoon.  Felt better when I woke up but when effects of Benadryl wore off, the tongue swelling intensified and frightened me.  Decided against emergency call on weekend and took Benadryl (4-6 hour) about 8 or 9 Pm and next morning (about 5 or 6AM) noted that I felt okay and tongue had become pink not red though still some swelling on the sides of tongue.  Had no strong adverse effects after first dose, some chills in the evening and arm swelling/pain  that resolved by 3AM.

Concomitant medications included unspecified thyroid pills and apixaban (ELIQUIS) as a blood thinner. The patient previously took moxifloxacin (AVELOX) and experienced allergy and rash and was in the hospital. On 24Jan2021 (the next day after vaccination), the patient experienced an &#34;allergy so bad&#34;, swelling and hives all over her body. The patient went to the emergency room due to the events and was &#34;hooked up&#34; with intravenous (IV)s for an hour before she could go home. The reactions were assessed as related to the vaccination by the patient. The patient was scheduled for her second dose on 23Mar2021. She was not given the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine fact sheet for recipients and caregivers until after being administered the first dose of the vaccine. If she had been given the fact sheet for recipients and caregivers before being administered the first dose, she would not have gotten the vaccine because the sheet says not to get the shot if you are allergic to other medications or other reasons for allergies or on blood thinners. The patient questioned whether she should get the second dose as her physician said she should not get the second dose while on apixaban. The clinical outcome of &#34;after her 1st dose, she had an allergy so bad&#34; and &#34;swelling and hives all over body&#34; was unknown.  Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal relation and known safety profile of the vaccine, a causal relation between events allergy to vaccine, swelling, hives and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

She immediately went to her physicians office and was directed to the emergency room at hospital. She was admitted and received an unknown I.V. and an unknown injection. After 2 hours she was released and was given 2 prescriptions to receive at her local pharmacy. The swelling lasted for 3 days. Five days later she had an identical reaction but it was on her left side of her face. A month later her blood was tested and she has had an  abnormally low blood platelet count.

She had felt well and had been in her usual state of health, and was able to cook and enjoy a turkey dinner with 5 individuals on 03/07/21, but on 03/08/21 she began to develop progressive generalized weakness up to the point where she remained in bed for several days.  She could not support herself when attempting to rise from bed.  She noted poor PO intake with nausea, no vomiting.  Loose stools for several days, no noted stool blood.  Did endorse waves of lightheadedness and had fallen backwards three times in the prior week, reportedly due to poor balance when standing.  She was unable to elaborate regarding the falls but admitted to hitting her head at least once, unable to say if she lost consciousness or if she felt presyncopal symptoms before falling.  She had initially presented on 03/12/21 to ED for evaluation, workup negative, labs and imaging normal.  CT brain found no acute process.  She was sent home with arrangements for home PT.  She returned to ED 03/15/21 when symptoms had not improved.  In the ED she was found to be afebrile, significantly hypertensive, mildly tachycardic, &#43; orthostatic vital signs.  Labs significant for heme occult positive stool, proBNP 397, WBC 10.1, H/H 13.4/39.9, PLT 493, UA neg for infection.  COVID neg.  CXR found slightly increased interstitial markings.  MRI brain found no acute intracranial abnormality.  She was evaluated by PT and found to be unsafe to DC home as she could not ambulate without leaning backward and to the right and needed 1-2 assist.  She was admitted to HM service for further management.  She has remained consistently afebrile.  She continues to experience significant gait instability, cognitive slowing, and difficulty with finger-to-nose testing with noted dysmetria, no focal weakness.

A 84-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK9231, Expiry Date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration in Jan2021 at single dose for vaccination. Dose injection to left deltoid around 14:00. Medical history included car wreck, hypertension, scoliosis. Concomitant medication included ongoing celecoxib (CELEBREX) for car wreck, amlodipine besilate, benazepril hydrochloride (AMLODIPINE/BENAZEPRIL) from 2017 and ongoing for anti-hypertension. The patient reported she had the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine a week ago and it did not really bother her until she started trying to do exercises of her arm. On 15Jan2021 she had a swollen lump that is quite sore on her left arm that did not go down and it had been 3 days now. She did not have a fever, the area was not red, it&#39;s just swollen. She just wanted to know if this event was customary with the product; and if her second dose should be given in a different anatomical location. It was just painful and swollen; had not been hospitalized for this event. She could see the difference, she was quite wrinkled now with age; but at the site of her swollen lump on left arm she had no wrinkles right now. Her second dose is scheduled for 02Feb2021 at 14:20. The outcome of events was not recovered.

An 84-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiration date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 12Jan2021 14:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On Jan2021, her left arm was blue from her shoulder to her elbow and almost the whole circumference going under her arm. On Jan2021, she has a slight left arm swelling and left arm discomfort. The discomfort was bearable. The discoloration of her left arm has become bad. She was at the COVID-19 vaccine clinic, some nurses looked at her arm, and insisted she contact Pfizer and her doctor to report what happened to her arm. She has an appointment with her doctor the afternoon of 20Jan2021. Her second COVID-19 vaccine dose is scheduled on 02Feb2021. Her left arm swelling and discomfort is the same now, but her left arm discoloration is awful. Her left arm discoloration is the only change she has experienced since her first report. Her left arm discoloration is what she calls &#34;puce&#34;, clarifying hers is a purple, black, and blue color. The discoloration of her left arm is uncanny. The discoloration stops before her left elbow like a completely straight line drawn by a ruler. The discoloration continues from her left elbow up to her left shoulder for which the discoloration spreads out unevenly. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported events based on the known safety profile and temporal association   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Pfizer COVID vaccine was administered at about 12:30 PM. Patient called staff over around 12:35 PM due to facial swelling, flushing and voice change.  Benadryl was administered at 12:40 PM via IM in the Right Deltoid. At 12:45 PM pulse was 78, Respirations were 20, and BP was 118/84. At 12:50 PM pulse was 76, Respirations were 21 and BP was 140/90. At 12:55PM pulse was 72, Respirations were 19 and BP was 132/82.  Patient denied ambulance services. Stated that she felt better at this time. Monitored patient for a total of 30 minutes and stated she felt fine at that point. Patient was followed up with the next day. She stated that no more Benadryl was needed at home. She slept a few hours after and continued to have slight facial swelling that lasted for a couple of days. Patient is unsure if she wanted to get the 2nd dose, but wanted to keep her appointment for it still. Her doctor recommends getting the second vaccine dose and told her to just take Benadryl and Pepcid before the vaccine. We educated her about the possibility of getting that second dose at her doctor&#39;s office or at Hospital in order for her to have more immediate access to emergency care.

                                                around her neck looks swollen; rash on neck is brown; itchy; worried; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 84-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Covid shot, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: Unknown, Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history included heart troubles. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication was heart medication. The patient experienced around her neck looks swollen, rash on neck is brown on 03Feb2021 and it was still ongoing and itchy, worried on an unspecified date. Patient stated she read information about a rash all over the body after the COVID vaccine. She has had none of the side effects. She read about severe allergic reactions. She does have a history or heart troubles. She was washing her hair on Wednesday, and she noticed around her neck it looked swollen. Like a little band around her neck. It could have been there before the vaccine. She called her doctor that same day and she said to call Pfizer, and that she thinks she should cancel the second one. She got her first COVID vaccine on 23Jan2021, and she is scheduled for the second 13Feb2021. She does take a heart medication. The place on her neck is not itchy. She knows the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. She sees her dermatologist for Basal cells and other things that are itchy. This place on her neck, if it is a rash, is brown not red. She gets a lot of those places on her skin. Her doctor told her to call Pfizer and then cancel her second appointment. She just wants to speak to medical information first. She doesn&#39;t even know if it is a rash. She hasn&#39;t had any side effects. Her arm didn&#39;t even hurt. This little rash is only on her neck. She had worked as a dental assistant. She is just worried now about getting the second shot. The outcome of event for itchy and worried was unknown and for other events it was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                My mother received the FIRST vaccine about 5:30 pm on Jan 13, 2021.  She did fine and went to bed without any issues at all.  When she awoke the next morning, she had a HUGE fever blister/cold sore on her bottom lip.   She had not had a fever blister in decades.  When she called me, I immediately took her Abreva.  She treated it with that 4-5 times a day for about 7-10 days.  It dried up and has finally gone away.  I just thought this was such an unusual reaction.  After doing some internet research and checking with several doctor friends, they had never seen or heard of this side effect.

Patient had received COVID vaccine shortly after noon day prior to admit on RUE. She reports that she had been experiencing some nausea as well.   She was admitted to the hospital for overnight observation secondary to transient alteration of awareness after she presented to the ED for arm swelling where experienced a syncopal episode lasting approximately 1 minute. She was monitored on cardiac tele which showed Afib with appropriate rate control overnight. For her left upper extremity swelling an U/S was done which was negative for thrombus, only a hematoma. Her arm pain was controlled and supportive with a compress. Patient had no further syncope, Afib rate controlled, and hemodynamically stable. Discharged home 2/24/21.

Started abating by Thursday 2/25/21 evening. Advised ice pack on arm, but pt. said it was too sore on day after dose given (Wednesday) to apply. Pt. took one aspirin on Wednesday morning. Advised her she could take a second later in the day. (Yesterday pt. stated she had taken a Tylenol. Today upon review she realized that she took an aspirin. Ibuprofen is also available. Advised pt. take an ibuprofen now over the phone as I waited. Taken at 8:13pm EST. No further medication taken on Wednesday. (Also encouraged ice pack on neck Wednesday for ongoing strong headache / neck pain yesterday. Pt. does not remember if she tried that. Head/neck pain resolved today.) Pt. states swelling today (Thursday) is mild-to-moderate, less than yesterday, but still noticeable. Doesn&#39;t hurt as much as it did yesterday, she says. She can now lift her arm without pain.

A little white dot appeared where needle was inserted. Arm swelled. Initially thought it was common. But was not getting better and was painful and made her not feel well. She went to the doctors thankfully a few days after and was advised that it was infected. Could have been dangerous for her if infection continued to move through her body.   She is now on antibiotics. This is strange to have an infection which makes us feel the needle was not properly sterilized? Something foreign entered at the time of that shot and we would like to have answers. The doctors could not even identify why this happened.  Company Pfizer..

An 85-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EW0162), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm on 10Apr2021 at the age of 85-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing arthritis and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient reported that she was not taking anything for arthritis, just some Tylenol once in a while over the counter (it was not prescription). The patient was taking an inhaler for COPD. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: ER2613), administered in left upper arm on 20Mar2021 at the age of 85-years-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced bladder infection and viral infection. The patient got the first Pfizer vaccine on 20Mar2021 and was alright for a few days afterwards. Then all of a sudden, she started getting infections on 28Mar2021, 8 days after she had the first vaccine. She got a real bad bladder infection then she went to the doctor and she got medication for that. She was with bladder infection then she came down with the viral infection. The patient reported that she has not even been going anywhere because of the virus and she has been staying home. She just goes to the grocery store and clinic to the doctor, that was it. The patient had an antibiotic for the bladder infection. Sulfamethoxazole was the name of the medication that was for bladder infection. They didn&#39;t give the medication for the viral infection. The patient reported that it was just a viral infection, it was not the Covid. Since then, she had her second dose of the vaccine on 10Apr2021 and from an unspecified date in 2021, her foot started, her foot swelled up and she didn&#39;t know. She takes lot of retention pills, so she thought maybe it was that. So she took her pills and everything and washed and start getting but the next day instead of the foot going down, the swelling went up to her leg and then the next day it went all away up to her hip. The swelling on the left side from the foot all away up to the hip. She went to urgent care on 21Apr2021 (reported as &#34;21st&#34;) and saw a doctor and she was tested and she had blood clots. Regarding lab test, the patient reported she had two infections and then she got the blood clot that was from her hip all the way down to her left leg to her ankle. She could not figure out that they called the test and what they tested. But they had a lab work done then one has a test, veins, and everything. She can&#39;t remember. The patient reported that her foot and her leg was swelled, her toes all over up to her leg swelled. She had a fat foot and a fat leg just one side. She would say since she has started taking medicines for that, she took the first dose at the evening of 21st (21Apr2021), the day she went to the urgent care, and she would say it was not any worse. The medication was supposed to break up the blood clot, but it was the big one from her hip all the way down to her foot. Just a little bit better. The outcome of the events was recovering.

An 86-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Mar2021 16:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing multiple sclerosis , ongoing hypertension, ongoing diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing stent placed and spasms; and from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously had flu shot and feel a little bit sick, it hit her lot harder with the flu shot. Concomitant medication includes, unspecified, diabetic and hypertensive medication and medication for spasms. On 25Mar2021, 45 minutes to an hour after the patient&#39;s first dose, the patient felt like someone was choking her and felt like her jaw was &#34;getting large&#34; without physically getting large. The patient was not able to get out of her wheelchair, even though she was normally able to do so on her own, and her blood pressure systolically reached 170. Her mother was given &#34;excess water&#34; and was given her hypertensive medication &#34;a little early&#34; which caused her pressure to come down quickly. Based on this reaction that her mother had, caller would like to know if it was safe for the patient to receive her second dose of the vaccine. They stayed about 15 min at the drive thru to make sure there was no reaction. It was about a 30-minute drive home with traffic. It happened within the hour, right when she got in the house. The patient had a reaction to the first dose, and the caller wanted to know if it was safe for her to get the second. Within the first hour the patient felt like someone was choking her, she felt like her jaw was swelling, she felt extreme weakness and could not stand, and her blood pressure shot up. It shot up to 170, but she did not know the diastolic. The patient felt like she was choking so she was doused with water to push anything through in case that would help. Within a couple of hours, the patient started to feel better. They gave her excess fluids and gave her blood pressure medication a little bit earlier and everything came back down. She was frightened when this first occurred. The feeling of choking and the feeling of jaw swelling got better and went away within a few hours. The patient had multiple sclerosis so weakness is always an issue and mobility is always an issue. She knew her tolerance and what she could do. That day they had taken her in a wheelchair from the car to the house and she could not get out of the wheelchair, which was not normal for her. This happened within an hour of the shot. The weakness lingered the longest. That side effect did linger. It took a couple of days. She was using a Hugo again to get herself around the house and believes this extreme weakness has gone away. She was exercising on a stepper when the caller was talking to her. Caller did not believe there had been any lasting effects. Blood pressure shot up: Started within an hour of the vaccine. She had been hypertensive for quite some time historically. Her medication had been keeping it under control. They administered her dose early that day and it brought it down, it did not linger. The patient had been housebound since the pandemic started. The outcome of the event blood pressure shot up was recovering, while the outcome of the event couldn&#39;t stand was unknown; and the outcome of the rest of the events was recovered on 25Mar2021.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

Her whole upper arm became swollen (inflammation) and somewhat &#34;hot to the touch&#34; and was reddish in coloring. The inflammation did NOT look like a golf ball, but rather like a small hill on her upper arm, with a slope. After that, she reported to me .... that she was getting &#34;winded&#34;, on walks with her best friend. They both live in a senior citizen residence center, which is NOT an &#34;assisted living&#34; facility. Now, the swelling (inflammation) is gone. My mother has now had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine and yesterday .... she did NOT report, any adverse reactions (yet) from her second injection.

An 88-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198) at the age of 88-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 19Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization; losartan potassium (lot number: LJ5020047-A, expiration date: Aug2023), via an unspecified route of administration from 2011 to an unspecified date in 2021 at 50 mg, 1x/day for blood pressure high; diclofenac sodium modified-release tablet (lot number: PW6V5QFTAF61, expiration date: May2022), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date in 2021 at 75 mg, 1x/day for an unspecified indication; ibuprofen (ADVIL LIQUI GELS, 200 mg strength, lot number: CY1426, expiration date: Jun2022) capsule, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date in 2021 at 2-4 capsules, as needed (daily) for an unspecified indication; and aflibercept (EYLEA) injection, ophthalmic from an unspecified date to 11Mar2021 at 1 DF (injection), every 8 weeks in each eye for macular degeneration. Medical history included macular degeneration (the wet kind), blood pressure high, spinal stenosis, and thyroid disorder (reported as thyroid something) she provided that it was something like hypotramea (as reported). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) at the age of 88-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid on 29Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was calling about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and mentioned that she had a reaction but didn&#39;t think it was from the vaccine because it was 5 weeks to the date after the second shot. The reaction was very severe, and she had to visit the emergency room. The patient experienced throat closing, tongue swelling, face swelling and a hard time breathing. She saw her primary care provider after that, and she also saw her PMR doctor- physical medicine and rehabilitation. The doctors recommended that she report this reaction to the COVID 19 vaccine five weeks later. Both doctors thought it might be from the vaccine and it was worth reporting. When asked about the symptoms and if they occurred at that same time, the patient stated yes, and they diagnosed her symptoms as angioedema in the emergency room. This happened on 26Mar2021. The patient was never admitted to the hospital. When asked if angioedema improved, worsened or was persisting, patient stated it was nonexistent now. The events happened after the second dose of the vaccine. The patient had to stop her medications because her primary care provider was unsure what may have caused this reaction, but it may be her medications. She has been taking losartan potassium for about ten years but now had to stop because angioedema could possibly be the result of that, even after ten years. She also had to stop diclofenac sodium because they may have caused that kind of reaction. Having to stop ibuprofen broke her heart as she has taken it for years. This too could have that type of reaction. For aflibercept, she mentioned that she gets the injections in both eyes every eight weeks. She had it 31 times in the right eye and 30 times in the left eye. The reaction she was speaking of, the emergency room, came exactly 2 weeks after she had her last injections, which was on 11Mar2021. Angioedema was an emergency situation, if the throat closes and they couldn&#39;t open it up, they may cut into the neck and windpipe. The description was enough to scare her. Both doctors suggested the Pfizer vaccine as just possibly a late reaction. The patient had a basic metabolic panel while in the emergency room. She reported that potassium and sodium was low. Chest Xray- the patient did not have a report on it. Nasal scan was fine. COVID nasal test was negative. Swab for many other kinds of viruses was negative. All of these tests were done on 26Mar2021. The action taken in response to the events for losartan potassium, diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, and aflibercept was unknown. The outcome of the event &#34;potassium was low and sodium was low&#34; was unknown and recovered on an unspecified date in 2021 for the other event.

An 89-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot unknown, first dose) solution for injection intramuscular in the left arm on 06Apr2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 89-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included seizures from 1970, serious migraines (would guess this was diagnosed about the same time as the seizures) from 1970, broken leg and ankle (diagnosed 4-5 years ago, she can&#39;t walk), severe arthritis (this was diagnosed about 5 years ago), Blood pressure high, and uses a walker and a wheelchair (prior to getting the vaccine). There were no concomitant medications. On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced severe allergic reaction, swollen lymph nodes, unable to move her left side of her body, muscle and joint pain, total numbness of her body, severe migraine, headache, injection site redness, and injection site swelling. In Apr2021, the patient experienced arm was hurting a lot. The patient went to the emergency room because she couldn&#39;t move the left side of her body, had a really bad migraine, and her head started hurting, but she didn&#39;t stay in the hospital. Treatment for the event migraine included acetaminophen (TYLENOL) but that was not doing anything. Shots of prednisone was offered for migraine but the patient refused. The outcome of the events allergic reaction, swollen lymph nodes, muscle and joint pain, total numbness of her body, severe migraine, headache, injection site redness, and arm was hurting was unknown. The outcome of the events unable to move her left side of her body and injection site swelling was recovering.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.
