Swelling of the right side of my face started within a few hours later.  Called Drs. , He recommended taking Tylenol.  (Second Day) Next day, felt short of breath, weak, applied ice packs to my face. Third day, felt weak.  By the fourth day, swelling and itching subsided; but skin on my face felt gritty under the skin. Drove me to the doctor&#39;s office the third day.  I was short of breath walking from the car to the door to the doctor&#39;s office.  I was wearing my mask.  I saw a PA; but, she didn&#39;t tell me much of anything.  I don&#39;t think she knew what to say.

                                                Approximately 1 hour after the shot, I raised a hive on my upper lip.  It very quickly (within 2 minutes) got to its maximum size.  Not noticeably swollen to an observer, but it felt swollen, red and throbbing. It was not a serious adverse reaction.  After about an hour, it was NOT going away, but it was NOT getting worse.  I never experienced trouble breathing. The office where I had the shot is &#34;not available&#34; on Friday afternoon, and my personal physician is not in the office on Friday.  I was advised by another doctor friend to take benadryl, which I did.  While looking at the CDC website, he also advised me that (having had this reaction) I should not receive the second shot.

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in 18Jan2021 at 15:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reporting on the COVID vaccine and who explained that she had a reaction to the vaccine. She had the vaccine yesterday (18Jan2021) about 03:30 in the afternoon and by the time she got home, within the hour, her lips tingled and she felt funny, and her eye lids tender. There was no one to call by that time and she did not think it was severe enough to go to the ER so she just took a Benadryl and went to bed. The patient woke up and her face was swollen more than before (onset reported as Jan2021). She doesn&#39;t think she is at the stage of life threatening, she can still breath, but doesn&#39;t know what to do at this point. Should she take more Benadryl or contact her healthcare provider. The patient asked if this makes her ineligible for the second dose. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

She said it does not hurt, but just feels kind of heavy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: EN5318), intramuscular on 25Jan2021 08:30 at single dose in the right arm for Prevention. Medical history included diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago, acid reflux and cholesterol, all on unknown dates. Concomitant medication included esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) taking for 10 years for Acid Reflux, ongoing metformin for diabetes, &#34;Sarxigo&#34; taking for about 3 years for diabetes and unspecified cholesterol medication. On 26Jan2021 09:30, the patient experienced arm swollen and turned red 3 inches above and below injection site. She said it does not hurt, but just feels kind of heavy. The flu shot did that to her too, but not as bad. Flu shot turned her arm red this year also. She got it in Oct2020. She also got in the right arm in the muscle. She would like to know if she will she be safe to take second dose of BNT162B2. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                Within 8 hours of the vaccine, I experienced severe muscle weakness (could not lift arms above head; could not stand from sitting position without pain). During night, could not turn over in bed without pain. This lasted for 3-4 days. Treated with Advil. Next symptoms were joint pains and stiffness and back pains, which also lasted about a week. Treated with Aleve and hot/cold compresses. Final symptoms are severe swelling and stiffness of hands and fingers, with cracked, peeling skin. I have had this for about a week now and it is not improving. Cannot grasp anything with either hand. Middle and index fingers on both hands useless.

After the second she got very cold and felt miserable like her legs had weights on them- this only lasted 1-2 days. Then two weeks later she got a ring around the injection site- and developed intense itching, burning, and erythema and warmth at the site and axillary lymph node swelling.  The muscle on her arm were tender and swollen as well. The lymphadenopathy, and arm pain and swelling lasted for over a month.   Pfizer :  Lot: 12831/8/21 Lot 9261 1/25/21

Patient stated that her rash looked worse than the woman in the newspaper. The rash happened after the second vaccine, several weeks later, but after the antibiotics. Patient was allergic to a lot of antibiotics. She stated she may have this problem, the rash because she was allergic to a lot of antibiotics.

                                                She had high Blood pressure yesterday; Second dose administered on the Left Arm, her arm did hurt a little on 06Feb2021, the day she got this dose; started getting hungry; she was 127lbs, probably because of the swelling, but she is usually 119lbs or 118lbs; swelling under her eyes/eyes started getting swollen; face was swollen; Eye infection; face felt tight; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot: EM9810; NDC number: Not Provided Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 06Feb2021 at 8:31AM (at the age of 76 years), as a 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included disc protruding (diagnosed before the covid vaccine in Jun2020 or around that, she recalls having several months of MRI&#39;s in 2020) and high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included Epidural Shot (Verbatim) for Protruding Disc Patient on 27Jan2021 (she had to go to the doctor in the clinic and get epidural shot in the back at the disc thats protruding). Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot: EL3249; NDC number: Not Provided, Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 at 12 PM (noon) as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 76 years) for COVID-19 immunization. Clinical course: She took second dose of Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 06Feb2021, though she had no reaction initially. A week later from vaccination on Feb2021, she then began to notice her eyes started getting swollen couple days after, she then felt like her eyes felt like they were closing, then she saw her whole face was swelling, it looks like she had Chipmunk cheeks. She went to the doctor hoping it would go away, she was prescribed Benadryl and a decongestant as treatment. She takes Benadryl three times a day and the decongestant in the morning and her face is still swollen. It started with the eyes and the bag under the eyes, that was the first thing she noticed. She laughs and though she initially had an eye infection. She just wants to know if there is any other reports of this happening, or how to get rid of it, this has been there since she got her second dose on the 06Feb2021 since like 10Feb2021. After the second vaccine on 06Feb2021 around that time an hour later, she was on the way home and started getting hungry, she thought that was a symptom as well as her arm hurt a bit. She was starving till Monday got up 2AM, 6AM ate all day Sunday and Monday ate all day, as reported &#34;all she knows is she was craving a crab sandwich.&#34; Her Eyes swelling started a couple days later and the Face swelling was either the second week or same time, she just recalls looking at the eyes. She recalls telling her son her face felt tight in Feb2021. At the doctors appointment she was 127lbs, probably because of the swelling, but she is usually 119lbs or 118lbs, she is a small girl. The Appointment with the doctor was yesterday (15Mar2021), they prescribed Benadryl. Patient clarified that she was not Prescribed Zyrtec, it was a decongestant but she does not know the name of it. The Druggist however told her she could take another medication also. As reported &#34;The eye swelling and face swelling, at the moment she look like she been drunk, her face is plentiful, she is still swollen, her lids are not bad, but it is ongoing, it has gotten worse because prior she didnt even know it was there and its showing more now. She asked son if he thought she was swollen because she feels tight, over the weekend her face being swollen was noticeable, she is noticing people are pointing it out now.&#34; She adds her arm did not hurt with first dose. Second dose administered on the Left Arm, her arm did hurt a little on 06Feb2021, the day she got this dose and the next day (07Feb2021). She thought initially that she didn&#39;t have any side effects. She had High blood pressure yesterday (15Mar2021), but that usually goes up and down for her and nothing new. It was reported that, a week later, patient experienced swelling under her eyes, face was swollen, eye infection and face felt tight on Feb2021; hunger and vaccination site pain on 06Feb2021 (reported as the day she got this dose); hypertension on 15Mar2021 (reported as yesterday). Patient would like to know if swelling of the face is a reported side effect from the covid vaccine, how long her side effects from the covid vaccine will last and asking for suggestions on how to get rid of the side effects from the covid vaccine. The outcome of event vaccination site pain was recovered in Feb2021 (duration of event was 2 days), swelling under her eyes, face was swollen was not recovered while outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

This is not about that but a week ago I began experiencing sharp pain in my thumbs when I tried to open a jar, pull up my pants, rub my hands together, flush the commode, etc.  I have never had this kind of pain before. I looked on the internet to see what might help and noticed that the pain could possibly be a reaction to the Covid vaccine.  Therefore, I am reporting it to you.

                                                her face got swollen something like that; This is a spontaneous report. A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included tooth canal/a tooth it&#39;s going bad on Jan2021. Concomitant medication included celecoxib (CELEBREX), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). The patient took the first vaccine and what happened is that she had a tooth canal then right after. The first dose happened on the 16Jan2021 which is last Saturday then after that it seems that the effect that her face got swollen something like that on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient stated, &#34;Yes, but it has nothing to do with the vaccine or an allergic reaction. It&#39;s just a tooth it&#39;s going bad. So I needed to go to the dentist and probably get an antibiotic (Unspecified medication captured as suspect) for it but I wanted to make sure that&#39;s not going to negate the strings of my vaccine. I didn&#39;t know what it would do to that. No, it&#39;s not because of the vaccine. I had actually had it X-rayed on the 13th and he didn&#39;t see anything that looked bad but it&#39;s gotten worse and it has pores, two pores it has nothing to do with the vaccine. I just I am concern about getting an antibiotic because I don&#39;t want it to affect my vaccine. As I said before the vaccine has nothing to do with my problem.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included X-ray: didn&#39;t see anything that looked bad but it&#39;s gotten worse and it has pores, two pores on 13Jan2021. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Face swelling is not related to the vaccine use but due to the underlying tooth canal issue.

                                                One hour after receiving the vaccination, I had an uncontrolable bout of diarrhea in a public place. Later in the day, I felt  fatigued, and aching, and my left arm started to get very tight and sore. The next day I felt the same, and my lymph nodes under both my arms began to swell and hurt and my rectum began to have severe pain. Still had  diarrhea.  By day 5 my left arm ,at the site of the injection ,started to swell, get very hot ,and a large, bright red welt appeared which  almost reached my elbow and went across the width of my upper arm..  I called my doctor and went to see her on the next day because it had gotten worse.  She thought it was a local reaction and recommended ice, tylenol and benedryl. Again, as with the first shot, I am not sure if this is an allergic reaction or not., but thought I would report it.

                                                Itchy burny skin rash started in right armpit and lower back, then migrated sequentually to left armpit, the sides of both breasts, the back of the right shoulder, the left thigh, and finally to the abdomen. The rash starts as fine red spots that later become inflamed and join to form large irregular patches that could be a 2 or 3 inches in diameter. Televisited primary care physician who prescribed Zyrtec twice a day and Caladryl topical lotion and referred me to a dermatologist who prescribed 0.05% Clobetasol Propionate Ointment and Benadryl as needed. The rash persisted and became worse after the 2nd shot 21 days later, but was fading slightly and was less itchy and burny just before the 2nd shot.  Will report 2nd shot events separately later.

She has been taking Tylenol.  She felt a little relief of the pain with the Tylenol.  She rested all day yesterday.  She left at 10:00 for her bridge club and that&#39;s where she noticed the reaction and has gotten home around 3:00 and not feeling well.  They told her to call us as they did not have any side effects from the vaccine.   She does have an appointment on 3/11/21 with her PCP.

A 77-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included weakened immune system because of the alcohol allergy (started while 19), and aches and pains. Concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (expiry date May2021) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 77 years old last 22Jan2021 administered on the upper righthand arm later clarified as upper right arm; and she was still going through that systemic reaction when she had her first COVID vaccine. The patient asked on regarding how effective the vaccine was related to receiving steroid therapy. Patient was advised by doctor to go to urgent care to have a covid test to see if she and husband were exposed to covid before the vaccines kicked in.  Patient stated that on an unspecified date in 2021, she still didn&#39;t feel well and was running one heck of a temperature (increased). Patient reported she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. She filled out the forms. Patient felt like she should be put in the hospital. She has a horrific allergy to alcohol. Each time she receives an injection it gets worse. She knew when she received the second dose that the third ingredient was alcohol. She thought about was worse, the virus or the reaction. Within a minute of taking the vaccine she had a reaction. She reported it at the site and was watched for a half hour. Her question was &#34;because she took prednisone immediately after getting the vaccine does that negate the shot?&#34; She was not asked the name of the steroid that she took. She was taking prednisone 20mg, 2 tablets as soon as she gets a shot then 2 daily Monday-Friday. It was still going through her system and it was reeking havoc on her. If she goes to the hospital they will give her Benadryl and monitor her. Patient stated that on 08Feb2021, she had an allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine. Patient stated that she had both COVID shots and had adverse reactions and took some medicine for the adverse reaction and now the patient was concerned it might mess with the shot, it might not work for her as it should. She knew that this was going to be a long process and she knew her allergies were rare, but they were there. She is allergic to isopropyl alcohol, even if it is in shampoos or liquid soaps, she gets reactions. She had her first COVID vaccine and she had her own hospital cleanser that she has with her at all times and she used it which was not a problem. For her second COVID vaccine, the nurse was naming the 3 ingredients that were in the COVID vaccine and asked if she was allergic to any. She said this last shot had alcohol in it, she sat with her husband next to her, and thought which was worse: getting COVID, the cases in the city are high, or having a reaction to the alcohol. She chose the latter. When it went into her arm she immediately knew she was getting a reaction. She had steroids with her just in case this happened. Each time the reaction happens, it gets worse. She said she sat for half an hour and has been on steroids until last Friday. She was supposed to be on them for days. On Friday, she was wondering if taking the steroids negated the effectiveness of the COVID vaccine and that&#39;s why she called in. She knew that this was rare and it was not something that the company going to say that the company know how to fix it. Patient worked in the health unit of a university as a hiring and firing people person. So, she was around it, but she was not a doctor or a nurse. So, she guessed the answer was no. Last week she received her second COVID vaccine. She said, she has got to get rid of 5 pounds, but it&#39;s harder to do that when you&#39;re older. She experienced the reaction from the isopropyl alcohol within her second dose of the COVID vaccine last week, 08Feb2021. She said she was still going through it and will for a while. When asked for the outcome, she said she couldn&#39;t answer that honestly. She said she didn&#39;t feel good (2021). Period. She knew that when she goes through this it takes, each time, an extra 4 to 5 days to get over it. When she got up this morning, she didn&#39;t feel good. Her husband asked if she wanted to go sailing, and she said not in 30 degree weather, but for her to say no to sailing, her husband knew she didn&#39;t feel well. She couldn&#39;t say worse, but she can say she didn&#39;t know how long it was going to be, which was scaring her. By doing what she did, if that negated the COVID vaccine, then lets go from there. That&#39;s what she was afraid of. When she tells people she is allergic to alcohol, and when it happens, they look at her like &#34;nobody is allergic to alcohol.&#34; She is 77 and has the aches and pains of a 77 year old, which she hates. But she doesn&#39;t think there are related medical conditions to what she experienced. This (allergy to alcohol) started when she was 19 and it has gotten progressively worse. So she tries to be careful. She says this was her, not dumb, but her decision that she made and now she is concerned.  She said no to any tests done. She had the immediate reaction and she knew what to do. Patient further reported that she has allergy to alcohol and had an adverse reaction after the 2nd shot due to alcohol swab and on an unspecified date in 2021, she experienced redness and swelling in her right arm and feeling hot all over the body. Patient asked if her doctor will prescribe Benadryl to manage my allergy will it affect the effectiveness of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event &#34;allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine&#34;. The patient did not recover from the event &#34;allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine&#34;. The outcome of the other events reported was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : 2021167304 PFIZER INC

The patient added that she has lived through it and her experience has been very unusual. The caller has underlying conditions that may have caused this event, she received the second dose on 08Mar2021, it was a horrible experience but since she is still alive she would want to report it. The caller does have strange reactions to chemicals and she typically goes to naturopaths and holistic doctors because of this. The caller also has multiple autoimmune disorders and feels like that may have played a part in this reaction. It was added that further added that she received her second dose 08Mar2021 at 3:30pm and had a little bit of a sore arm, she was thinking positive thoughts about all of this because she never gets vaccines. At 2:00am on 09Mar2021 the caller was awaken in excruciating pain, every surgery she has had or accident manifests in the greatest pain. The pain was excruciating the caller took over the counter pain medicine and diclofenac and it didn&#39;t help. The caller is unsure of what she took, she may be making this up. The caller felt like she was dying, she felt like her internal organs were shutting down, it happened all week. The caller was so weak her husband fed her and made sure she was drinking. The caller thinks she would die if she had to have a booster shot of this vaccine. The caller has never had anaphylactic shock, could this have been anaphylactic shock? All of the pain from a surgery all occurred at once and her entire body was wrecking, in horrible pain, that she does not think heroin could have taken care of. After the second vaccine she was literally so weak that she felt like all of her vital organs were shutting down and it lasted for 6 days, like she got hit by a truck, like had beat her up. The caller knows that there are new found reactions with (Company name) and they stopped thousands of doses because of it, she saw this in the news today. The patient wanted to make note that she has underlying autoimmune diseases, she is unsure if there is a correlation between this and her reaction. The caller was changing from her thyroid medicine and her thyroid went very high with the generic brand so she was swapped to Synthroid in the middle of this. The caller was on levothyroxine and it wasn&#39;t working, her thyroid was sky high (Unknown lot number and expiration date Feb2022). The caller was going through all of these changes as well when she received the vaccine. The caller&#39;s doctor took a test and the caller has antibodies and they are there but not very strong. The caller doesn&#39;t want to be spreading something because she is feeling healthy and fine today. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                My Mom had an an allergic reaction four hours after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Her face swelled up and became red....worse on the right side than the left...her eyes were swollen as well. It lasted this way for four days....it is a little better now, but her face is still a little swollen (seven days after shot). She had a headache on and off and felt tired (which we understand is not an allergic reaction, but rather an immune response). Her family physician suggested taking antihistamines before her second shot. Needless to say, we are apprehensive about what the outcome from the second shot will be like for her.

                                                I was vaccinated with Pfizer for the first time 11 days ago. Within a few minutes of being vaccinated, I felt nauseated but I did NOT throw up. I have been sick ever since with one thing and another. For the first several days after being vaccinated, I had a sore arm, which I expected. I have also experienced extreme fatigue, chills, nausea, muscle and joint aches, a sore throat (briefly), an occasional headache, tenderness in my left armpit and along the left side of my rib cage, stomach pain and diarrhea and at times, a low-grade fever and sweating. My memory and ability to focus on my work have been affected. Yesterday (March 13), I felt OK all day and thought I was better at last, but after I ate dinner, I vomited and had diarrhea. I told my primary care physician about all of this in an email and she replied that my symptoms were &#34;normal.&#34; I&#39;m not so sure. I haven&#39;t read of anyone else feeling so sick for so long after the first dose of Pfizer.

                                                Two weeks and six days after the first shot, my left arm became swollen, as if it was lymphedema, something I don&#39;t get, or perhaps gout.  After the second shot, the arm swelled more, with the hand looking like a balloon and a few days of tiredness.  I put on a few pounds.  Dr wanted to rule out a recurrence of breast cancer so she sent me for ultrasound, mammograms, and CT scans, with a week gap to take antibiotics for a UTI.  At a coincidental checkup with my glaucoma doctor, he said the intraocular pressure had shot up and added 0.5% Timolol eyedrops, a beta blocker.  In a few days, the swelling is less and the extra weight gone.

After a month I called the dr. and  was told to take 2 naproxen twice a day to relive  swelling.  T his helped, but when I stopped the pain came back.  Does not hurt just sitting, only when I try to lift something.  Think injection was given in a muscle.  Hurts when I left arm above shoulder.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm  on 24Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation (Age at vaccination 78 years).  The patient medical history was not reported.  On 04Feb2021 the patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 and experienced sore arm.   The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced pain with walking left leg  on 28Feb2021 with outcome of recovering , left leg swelling/ it got so swollen/left foot swelling  on 03Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered , numerous blood clots below the knee  on 04Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: unknown results,  ultrasound joint: numerous blood clots below the knee   on 04Apr2021   , vital signs measurement: unknown results.  Course of the event: The patient  waited for the timeframe after the second dose and had no problems. 4 days after, she experienced pain with walking in her left leg.  She took Aleve for a few days.  It got so swollen, she should have gone then to her Primary Medical Doctor, but she did not go until 25Mar2021. She was sent to  Hospital for an Ultrasound of her leg on 04Apr2021.  After the Ultrasound, she was taken to the Emergency Department at the hospital. The doctor told her she had numerous blood clots below the knee.  Was prescribed Eliquis 5mg.  She was instructed to take 2 tablets or 10mg twice a day, 8hrs apart for 1 week and then 1 tablet twice a day for the remainder of the 74 tablets. She completed that. She was out of them and got a refill of Eliquis 5mg on 26Apr2021. She received 60 tablets and can refill for 5 times. She is really concerned. The swelling is still so bad and so that could that mean blood clots are still in there. The ER doctor told her that the medication is dangerous.  It thins the blood and can cause bleeding and the blood clot can go to her heart.  Follow up information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causality has been assessed as related to bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm  on 24Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for covid-19 immunization, based on temporal association and profile of the product.,Linked Report(s) : 2021499984 same patient/drug, diff dose/event

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID- 19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 26Jan2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, Single Dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Von willebrand&#39;s disease Von Willebrand syndrome and Glanzmann&#39;s disease and allergies. Family history included bleeding disorder. She was poisoned by pesticides and formaldehyde years ago and they burned her entire respiratory system. There were no concomitant medications. The patient never had a reaction to a vaccine. No vaccines administered on same Date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations were given within 4 weeks and no adverse events following prior vaccinations. On an unspecified date of Feb2021, the patient experienced lips tingling, face red which felt like swollen, tongue started to tingle, her face felt tight. The events lasted about 1- 2 hours. Patient wanted to know; can she take a Benadryl before the vaccine. The second dose is due on 16Feb2021 so the first dose was 3 weeks before that one was due. After getting the shot, her lips started to tingle, tongue started to tingle, and her face felt real tight. When the nurse came out to check on her, she was told by the nurse her face was really red. The nurse was going to get an EpiPen and wanted to call EMS. The reporter states she told her to just give her a Benadryl, she normally has them in her car but had run out. Patient stated she was allergic to everything. Anything coming in contact with her respiratory system such as hair spray, scents, any chemical causes her problems. The patient explained that she was re-reading the information about telling the vaccination provider about medication conditions including allergies and bleeding disorder, both of which she has. She was concerned about getting the second dose. She wants to know if the first dose will offer any protection. She had the first dose of the covid shot on 26Jan2021. She started feeling funny. The patient called the nurse and reports her lips were tingling and her tongue was starting to tingle. Her face was really red. Her face felt like it had pressure like it was blowing up but it did not feel swollen, it was tomato red. The patient queried if she does not get the second dose what will that do. She knows there needs to be given a certain amount of time between the doses. She heard on the tv that it can be given up to 45 days and still be effective. She heard all kinds of information, she heard that someone should get the second dose within 28 days and the paperwork states something different. Asked if her reaction will be worse with second shot. She was supposed to go back on 16Feb2021 for the second dose. Patient stated she took Benadryl after her reaction from the vaccine. She wanted to know if this affects the vaccine. Patient mentioned the fact sheet states that patients should tell the vaccination provider if they have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner. She states she has a bleeding disorder. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. She took a Benadryl for treatment. The outcome of the event was resolved on an unspecified date of Feb2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up attempts completed. No further information expected.

Treatment consisted of 2 weeks of antibiotics and steroids and, eventually PT with a specialist in lymphedema swelling. This side of the patient has many of her lymph nodes removed in conjunction with a surgical removal of a right breast cancer lump removal some 25 years ago. No lymphedema symptoms had ever incurred in the patient prior to the covid vaccination. PT is ongoing but little improvement after 2 weeks of treatment.

A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0186, Expiration date and NDC number are unknown, time the vaccination was given: Noon), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 03Jun2021 at the age of 78-years-old as 2nd dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient s medical history including any illness at time of vaccination were osteopenia, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, diagnosed over 20 years ago in 2001. The patient s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of historical vaccine, bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0186, Expiration date and NDC number are unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 13May2021 at the age of 78-years-old for covid-19 immunisation. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) if applicable, list any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine were none. Adverse events following prior vaccinations were none. Family medical history relevant to adverse events were none. Relevant tests were none. History of all previous immunization with the pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) were none. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect were none. It was reported that event happened after the second dose of the vaccine. About a week after receiving the second dose, her lower lip broke out with cold sores on an unspecified date in Jun2021 and she has been fighting this more than a week now. She tried Zovirax (NDC and lot unknown, expiration date 31Mar2021) which usually helps with this but it did not this time. It has been years since this has happened. Yes, this has happened to some other people. It has been two weeks now. The Zovirax tamped it down a little but did not get rid of it like it normally does. She thinks her immune system is working and her immune system is causing the issue. It was reported that she had the normal flu like symptoms and headache on 04Jun2021 and it went away in under three days, she thought it was normal. The caller also had a sore arm on 03Jun2021 and aches and pains on 04Jun2021. By the fourth day the caller was fine. The caller wanted to make Pfizer aware that someone else had the herpes complex problem. The adverse events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. It was reported that age at time of onset of reaction/event was 78. Time of onset of adverse events was unknown. There was no investigation assessment. It was reported that she is tired of lock down and she does not want to wear a mask the rest of your life. She googled to see if anyone else had this come up and it seems to be a minor amount of people that have experienced it. She didnt expect for this to happen to her. The reporter assessed events as non-serious. The reporter assessed events relatedness to Pfizer covid vaccine as Related. The outcome of event, lower lip broke out with cold sores was not recovered while for other events was recovered on an unspecified date in Jun2021.  Additional information is requested.

She exercises regularly and has become so weak that she cannot climb stairs.  Neurological exam revealed hyperreflexia, subtle proximal muscle weakness, the presence of a startle reflex and rooting reflex, clonus, and a positive Babinski.  Infectious work up has been negative, autoimmune evaluation is underway.  Inpatient neurology consultation has been obtained, she was given a trial of diazepam for stiff person syndrome and started on daily IVIG on 2/3/2021 for a 5 day course. She continues to have an elevated CRP, a mild transaminitis, and mild thrombocytopenia.  The ESR dropped from 44 to 20 with hydration.  She has had no cognitive changes. No headache, visual changes, jaw pain. We are unable to obtain MRI given the presence of these coils which are not MRI compatible.  Encephalitis immune antibodies are pending, myositis panel, MOG antibodies ADEM are pending, GAD65 antibody pending.

I had a bright red rash on hand, thighs, buttocks, with small blisters in between fingers and inside upper and lower lips. Also, had hives, welts, and swelling of these areas. Severe itching that did not subside. On March 14th I went to urgent care, by Tuesday March 16th it was worse, went to see Doctor and she increased Pepcid and prednisone dosage that I was given at urgent care. She increased my Zyrtec that I was taking from home and added Singulair. She did labs at this time. I was much better the week of March 21st and advised to see an allergist. Saw him on March 23rd, and he advised no more vaccines until her could test me. So far, April 1st there is no Pfizer vaccine available for test. I&#39;m making another virtual appointment for April 20th.

                                                I went to the hospital with palpitations; lightheadedness; She had terrible back pain in center of back; She felt achy; fatigued; back discomfort; she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling; she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling; she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling; Her breast felt like it weighed 60 pounds and ached.; had the worse headache; Her shoulder blade was tender; neck pain; achy feeling was ongoing with her muscles; achy feeling was ongoing with her legs; legs felt rubbery; short winded; sweaty; she felt clammy and hot.; she felt clammy and hot.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder on 11Feb2021 at age of 79-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization; methylprednisolone (MEDROL, Tablet), orally from 20Feb2021  to 26Feb2021, at 4 mg, by mouth, frequency was different based on the day, from 27Feb2021  to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose for swelling, the back. Medical history included thyroid and pericarditis fluid. Family history included brother had heart disease. There was no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) ongoing for thyroid for 20 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 in left shoulder on 21Jan2021 (Batch/lot number: EN6201) for COVID-19 immunization with no side effects.  The patient had her 2nd Pfizer vaccine dose on 11Feb2021 and received a &#34;medrol pack&#34; on 20Feb2021 for &#34;shoulder, back and neck pain. She have felt lousy for 4 weeks. She went to the hospital with palpitations and it probably was from the 2nd pack of methylprednisolone, she was prescribed after the 1st pack did not really help her pain. She haven&#39;t been sick or had a cold for 25 years and the 2nd dose through her for a loop. She stated her daughter called her and she said that her doctor told her that her vaccine may not be effective and she may not be protected because she took methylprednisolone. The patient received the second vaccine on 11Feb2021 and she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling. The patient mentioned she went to her doctor because after calling the COVID hotline they said they had cases where some of the vaccine had seeped into the lymph nodes. She was told to have her lymph nodes. No patient demographic details provided regarding those other patients who had the vaccine seep into lymph nodes. She went on to explain she went to the doctor, but the doctor said there were no problems with the lymph nodes. On 13Feb2021, she felt achy and fatigued, back discomfort. The lightheadedness occurred on 18Feb2021. The doctor gave her a high dose of the methylprednisolone 4mg pack for a week. 16 days later on 27Feb2021 it had not touched the discomfort in back, fatigue and lightheadedness and gave her another pack of methylprednisolone.  She also had heart palpitation, was sweaty and went to the Emergency Room. The patient mentioned she took a low dose of levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). She asked the doctor about the methylprednisolone being taken after the shot. The patient heard it diminished the effect of the shot, that she may not have as much protection. She had called the COVID hotline to address this issue and they said people who were on chronic steroid therapy had no problem as far as they know. The patient asked if she was protected because she had the methylprednisolone pack the first one within 9 days after shot and a second pack 16 days later. She took a low dose of generic levothyroxine sodium every day. She commented she was concerned with the drug interaction and wanted to make sure still protected. She was informed by individual who answered COVID hotline she felt like she was still protected because others have been on chronic steroid therapy. Shoulder swelling started a couple day after the second shot, explained it was there or about around 13Feb2021. Her shoulder blade was puffy and tender. The swelling went into the arm and breast. Her breast felt like it weighed 60 pounds and ached. That took a while to go away. The patient explained initially it was also there or about around 13Feb2021 when she noticed she was so fatigue and had the worse headache (Feb2021), she never got nauseous. Her shoulder was still swollen a week ago as of 09Apr2021. She went to a chiropractor for an adjustment and the chiropractor said shoulder was still a little swollen. She had terrible back pain in center of back on 18Feb2021. It was so much that she was afraid something else was going on. The patient stated the swelling it was ongoing up until a few days ago as of 09Apr2021. She still had puffiness around that area when went to chiropractor. For the back discomfort she went to chiropractor for adjustment. She was unsure when that discomfort went away. The achy feeling was ongoing with her muscles and legs until last week as of 09Apr2021 when she started to feel better. Her legs felt rubbery. Her muscles felt achy. She felt better as of 09Apr2021. It had gotten better within the last week as of 09Apr2021. The fatigue was ongoing until last week as of 09Apr2021. The patient felt so bad for month and had no idea what was going on. Her lightheadedness went away last week as of 09Apr2021. She commented she did not want to blame all of this on the shot because she did not know what methylprednisolone did to her. The patient confirmed she had back discomfort. She still had some back discomfort. She started to fell short winded a week before the heart palpitations appeared really bad on 21Mar2021. She did not feel short winded anymore, but she was unsure when that stopped. With her heart palpitation she felt clammy and hot. Therefore, she wen to the ER. The heart palpitations gradually got better, and probably stopped totally last week as of 09Apr2021. She mentioned she had a headache for a good month after the second shot. It started either the 13Feb2021 or 14Feb2021. She stated all her symptoms were getting much better since last week as of 09Apr2021. There was no other treatment beside the methylprednisolone for her symptoms. Therapy start and stop date of methylprednisolone captured as confirmed by reporter in formal field, unable to clarify further. The patient confirmed all had been discarded and no lot/exp/NDC to provide. When she was in Emergency room, they did two EKG, drew blood work for the heart, chest x-ray back and front, and verified vital signs which were all good. She went home that same night on 21Mar2021. She went back to doctor on 05Apr2021 and did another chest x-ray and another echocardiogram and everything was fine. The event heart palpitation required a visit to emergency room, the patient was not sure if from the vaccine or methylprednisolone. The patient&#39;s heart rate got to 120, her normal was 80. The relevant Tests on 21Mar2021 they did Chest x-ray back and front, a couple EKG and blood work. The patient went back about a week ago as of 09Apr2021 because she was still not feeling great. They did an EKG, ordered echocardiogram and chest x-ray which were done on 05Apr2021. Test results came back on 08Apr2021. She had pericarditis fluid in the past and that&#39;s what they were checking for with the echocardiogram. The lab tests and procedures for investigation on 21Mar2021 included: chest X-ray: negative, EKG: negative, blood work: negative, negative. The action taken in response to the events for the methylprednisolone was unknown. The outcome of achy, back discomfort, back pain was resolving, the outcome of short winded was resolved in 2021, outcome of headache was resolved in Apr2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

Her edema has continued since then.  One day after her second dose of Pfizer vaccine (lot # EN6201) on 2/20, which she received in her left arm, she developed sudden acute edema in her right foot and leg.  She was seen on 2/22 by a nurse practitioner and had ultrasounds of her right arm and right leg.  The ultrasounds ruled out  DVTs  and/or vascular abnormalities.  Her physician concluded that her edema is an adverse effect of the Pfizer vaccine.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took phenytoin sodium (DILANTIN) and carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) and experienced allergy as her reaction to those were sometime between 2010 and 2012. On 30Jan2021 after three and a half hours, the patient felt sensation at her foot for that she could not walk, experienced chills, hands were shaking, had a swollen ankle and foot and pain. Around 5 o clock, the patient stated that it was like a strange sensation in her foot and she also got chills. By 7 o clock, she was in pain. The patient stated that she took two Tylenol. The patient stated that at around 9 o clock, she noticed that her ankle and foot were swollen with red blotches on it so she took two Benadryl and then slept until noon. The patient stated that Benadryl actually gave her some relief, although the pain didn&#39;t completely subside, but it subsided a little so that it was more tolerable. The patient stated that she had been debating if she should have gone to the emergency room (ER), but she didn&#39;t because she has a high pain tolerance. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 80-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284) on left arm, intramuscular on 02Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pancreatic cancer stage IV metastasized, blood pressure (abnormal) and chemo. Concomitant medication included pancreatin (CREON) for pancreatic enzymes. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 12Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had a side effect and it&#39;s so weird, she was a cancer patient she was in (city, state) and she had her first Covid vaccine on 12Jan2021 and she had her second one on 02Feb2021 and not a reaction until yesterday (06Feb2021) her left arm got a red rash, all the way up and down her shoulder to mid way between her elbow and hand and some swelling and she just wanted to make sure. She did look at the sheet and it does say you can get a rash, she has no temperature and she wanted to make sure that&#39;s a part of it all. When clarified if the retired registered nurse wanted to if it was the side effects from Covid vaccine, she stated, she guessed so because she got it on Tuesday and her arm hurt a little bit (Feb2021) but no rash showed up until yesterday which was Saturday. The patient had blood work done last Monday on 01Feb2021 with unknown results. The patient reported that she knows her white count was low (unspecified date) because they could give her chemo, so she actually has blood work on Monday 01Feb2021. Treatment was not received and patient stated, it just showed up yesterday and her nurse told her not to put anything on it. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown. Date of second shot was 17Mar2021, it was reported patient had got the both shot of covid vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021404239 similar report from same reporter

Was seen by her primary MD and given antibiotics for presumed facial cellulitis (clindamycin and cephalexin). The facial swelling improved but then her right eye became red with worsened vision (3 days prior to presenting to ophthalmology). Exam found new onset of inflammation of the conjunctiva and all internal structures (panophthalmitis). She is a long-time patient at the eye clinic since 1993 and has never had inflammation in either eye prior to this episode. There is no other explanation for the sudden presentation of an acute inflammatory condition.

                                                Patient is an 80 y/o right handed female who is totally independent at baseline who received her Pfizer vaccine out of the country (1st dose 2/19/21, 2nd dose 3/12/21).  She was reactive to both shots, reporting arthralgias, headache, low grade fever, chills. She had a rise in blood pressure later during the day of her shot as well as the next day (up to 180/70, from baseline of 130/70). She also had an episode of epistaxis several days after her first shot.  She traveled independently out of the country on 3/31/21 to visit her son on a leisure trip. On 4/5/21 she had headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, and did not feel well, and her systolic BP was 198, after which she took additional 40 mg of lisinopril.   Her BP subsequently decreased to systolic BP of 130 mm Hg on 4/5/21, but over the next few days she had labile BP with a range of BP of 125 to 171/ 58 - 68.  She was meticulous in checking and recording her BP several times a day, and she increased her lisinopril dose to 40 mg po qd from 20 mg po qd given the higher than usual blood pressure range.  On 4/10/21 her BP was as follows: 6:30 am, 148/60 (she took her daily lisinopril 20 mg po); 11:30 am:  132/52; 3 pm: 171/69 (she took additional lisinopril 20 mg po) after which her systolic BP decreased to 130. Then around 6:20 pm the same day (4/10/21), she had acute onset of headache, vomiting, left sided weakness, SBP 220, and was witnessed to have rapid change in mental status. There was no antecedent trauma to the head. EMTs were called immediately and she had loss of consciousness during the ambulance ride to the ED, after about 20 minutes of symptom onset, with agonal breathing and bradycardia to the 40s, but never lost her pulse. Upon arrival to the ED out of the country, her Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, she was rapidly intubated and stabilized. Head CT demonstrated massive intraparenchymal hemorrhage (140 cc) within the R temporal parietal and occipital lobes, with cerebral edema and 14 mm midline shift, associated with small subdural hematoma and small intraventricular hemorrhage within the temporal horn and body of the R lateral ventricle. They reported hyperdense &#34;spot sign&#34; within the intraparenchymal hematoma compatible with active hemorrhage, no evidence of venous thrombosis, no masses, no arteriovenous malformations. She had 2.5 mm aneurysm right  that was thought to be incidental finding unrelated to her event. She was taken emergently to the OR on 4/10/2021 for decompressive R hemicraniectomy, which she underwent successfully with minimal blood loss.  She had no coagulopathy and her platelets and hemoglobin were normal. She remained in the Neuro ICU for 3 weeks. She received a tracheostomy two weeks after her presentation, and was weaned off the ventilator. She is breathing spontaneously after 5 weeks from presentation. She remains in coma or minimally conscious state, with GCS score of 5-6 as of 5/13/2021.

A 81-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL8982) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 20Jan2021 mid-afternoon at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation diagnosed about 25 years ago, Canker sore on 18Jan2021 (she did go the doctor for that and the doctor urged her to rinse it with salt water to she&#39;s been doing that), some soreness in her month on 18Jan2021, gout reaction. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. No Pfizer vaccine was administered on the same date. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. The patient got a reaction that she thought should be noted. She has had a very slight history of gout. She woke up this morning on 21Jan2021 and her big toes hurt. She knew that this was a symptom of what she had had in the past which was gout. The patient confirmed her big toes hurting was pretty much staying the same. It&#39;s not that uncomfortable. She knew from past experience that this was what happens, like when she ate certain foods like seafood or whatever, she would have this kind of gout reaction. This morning on 21Jan2021, she also felt the glands in her neck on the right side were swollen. The swelling seemed to have gone down. Her army was also very sore. She stated the soreness began last night, in the evening on 20Jan2021. The soreness had pretty much stayed the same. She expected the soreness, but she didn&#39;t expect her toes to hurt. It was important to note &#34;she is able to able the gout&#34;. She had only had gout really bad time once and then she&#39;s had a little bit every so often. The gout just seems to be connected to the vaccine- she could not say nothing that she ate would indicate other wise. The events did not require visit Emergency Room or Physician Office. She had an appointment for 10Feb2021 to get the second COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of event glands in her neck on the right side swollen was recovering, outcome of events was not recovered.

An 81-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid, on 16Jan2021 (also reported as 15Jan2021), at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included therapy for her back. There were no concomitant medications. After the patient got her first vaccine on 16Jan2021 (also reported as 15Jan2021) which was almost a week now, she was experiencing side effects. In Jan2021, the patient had chills, fever of 101, swollen lymph nodes, and aches. The patient had swollen glands or lymph nodes at the base of her skull, the lymph node venapathy (unspecified; as reported). The patient underwent a COVID-19 test yesterday (21Jan2021) to be sure (unknown results). The patient asked that if this is from the vaccine, how long could she expect to have these side effects. The patient was scheduled for it for the second dose in February. As treatment for the events, the patient was taking ibuprofen (MOTRIN), had taken paracetamol (TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH) at 1000 mg every 6 hours, and ibuprofen (ADVIL) at 400 mg. The patient had not recovered from the events. The patient considered that the events had a causality with the suspect product.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

As I examined the area several times during the next couple of hours I noticed a lump.  The lump was moveable, but seemed about the size of a nickle.  It scared me even though it was not actually in my breast.  The doctor told me since it was moveable and felt smooth he thought it to be a reaction to the Covid vaccine, but ordered a mammogram.  I called for the mammogram and was told I could not have one until 4 weeks after the 2nd shot.  I have a mammogram scheduled 3/26/2021.

Day after, Saturday, itching intensified, throat tightened (muscular feeling); and tongue began to become sore, and began to show redness on sides.  Bad enough that I finally took a 4-6 hour dose of Benadryl, and slept afternoon.  Felt better when I woke up but when effects of Benadryl wore off, the tongue swelling intensified and frightened me.  Decided against emergency call on weekend and took Benadryl (4-6 hour) about 8 or 9 Pm and next morning (about 5 or 6AM) noted that I felt okay and tongue had become pink not red though still some swelling on the sides of tongue.  Had no strong adverse effects after first dose, some chills in the evening and arm swelling/pain  that resolved by 3AM.

An 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the arm on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 82-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included the patient was on blood thinner therapy; allergy to a lot of medications, mold and cut grass; operation to remove clots in Nov2020 (two months prior to vaccination); thyroid disorder. Concomitant medications included unspecified thyroid pills and apixaban (ELIQUIS) as a blood thinner. The patient previously took moxifloxacin (AVELOX) and experienced allergy and rash and was in the hospital. On 24Jan2021 (the next day after vaccination), the patient experienced an &#34;allergy so bad&#34;, swelling and hives all over her body. The patient went to the emergency room due to the events and was &#34;hooked up&#34; with intravenous (IV)s for an hour before she could go home. The reactions were assessed as related to the vaccination by the patient. The patient was scheduled for her second dose on 23Mar2021. She was not given the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine fact sheet for recipients and caregivers until after being administered the first dose of the vaccine. If she had been given the fact sheet for recipients and caregivers before being administered the first dose, she would not have gotten the vaccine because the sheet says not to get the shot if you are allergic to other medications or other reasons for allergies or on blood thinners. The patient questioned whether she should get the second dose as her physician said she should not get the second dose while on apixaban. The clinical outcome of &#34;after her 1st dose, she had an allergy so bad&#34; and &#34;swelling and hives all over body&#34; was unknown.  Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal relation and known safety profile of the vaccine, a causal relation between events allergy to vaccine, swelling, hives and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                COVID Vaccine  I got my #2 Pfizer last Tuesday Apr 6....no problem at all with #1.  The vaccination was in my LEFT arm, and the 1st day or so I didn&#39;t really have anything but tiredness.  But the last few days have been very painful.  I developed swelling on the RIGHT side of my face starting at the temple. That progressed down to the ear area the next few days and was quite painful.   Since Saturday  my tongue, lips, gums became swollen resulting in barely being able to swallow. Also rash developed and is getting worse.  Additionally I ache all over and feel like a very bad case of the flu.  I tried Tylenol Extra Strength in the beginning, but that seemed to only ease the pain for about an hour.  Now I&#39;m  using  Advil, which helps for several hours.  Is there anything I can do to get relief.  This is the 8th day....and it seems to be getting worse instead of better.

An 82-year-old male received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot/Batch number: Unknown, ExpirationDate: Unknown) on 30Mar2021 via unspecified route of administration at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 Immunization. The patients medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated the next morning she could not open her mouth, could not chew, face was hot and puffy, might have some fever also. She took a couple of Aleve, and it went away after couple of days. The patient stated she didn&#39;t know for sure if it was related to the Covid-19 vaccine or not. The day that she got the Covid-19 vaccine, later provided as 30Mar2021, she felt fine and never had a sore arm or fever. It was reported that it was almost like lockjaw, that she couldn&#39;t brush her teeth or chew. The patient reported that later in the day, the side of her face was all hot and might have been swollen and she took ibuprofen and that the inability to open her mouth went away in a couple of days. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient reported that she went to the chiropractor a couple of days later and the chiropractor said that he had heard about patients experiencing lockjaw after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and she looked on Pfizer&#39;s website and the AE she experienced was not listed as a side effect. She is just a little concerned as she is scheduled to receive her second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine next week on 20Apr2021. She is afraid that the lockjaw might come back and might be worse. She is just curious if she is the only one that experienced the inability to open her mouth. The patient reported she does not know anyone that had this reaction and it is not listed as a side effect on Pfizer&#39;s website. The outcome of the event was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Chest xray showed radiographic evidence of pneumonia in RLL but without evidence of acute PE on CT scan. Patient was requiring 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations and so was placed on high flow nc with better response 4/23 remained on HFNC 4/24 BCx from 4.22.21 growing out gram positive cocci in 1/2 bottles 4/26 HFNC at 50% and 45L 4/27 off HFNC and on 6 L NC/ awaiting PT evaluation 4/28 per, OT assessment -- pt dropped into 70&#39;s on 6L 02 with short walk to bathroom and toileting tasks. cues for rest and PLB needed to increase 02 into 80s. with a seated rest break over 5 mins 02 increased to 88% on 6L  COVID pneumonia (first dose of Pfizer vaccine mid April) S/P remdesivir X 5 days, now on day 8/10 decadron but will go home on oral decadron  Acute hypoxic respiratory failure slowly improving (not on home oxygen therapy) now off HFNC, was on 10 L oxymask.

History of thymoma s/p VATS 2011 -outpatient follow up   Positive blood culture on admission, contaminant in 1 of 2 blood culture bottles. Repeat blood cultures showed no growth. Not on antibiotics   Associated attestation  - 04/22/2021 3:39 PM EDT   Formatting of this note might be different from the original. Patient seen and examined. Current status reviewed with resident staff. I have reviewed pertinent physician documentation, laboratory and radiographic data. I have initiated therapies based upon this reviewed  In brief 82-year-old woman with history of COPD, mediastinal mass status post VATS with benign thymoma with local recurrence presented with respiratory tract symptoms since 6 days prior to admission COVID testing is positive. In the emergency room she was noted be hypoxemic requiring 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations. She is currently on high-flow feels much improved.  I concur with exam as per Pulmonary fellow. Laboratories and imaging reviewed in detail.  Impression COVID-19 infection COVID-19 pneumonia Severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring high-flow oxygen Thrombocytopenia which is new since 2016 and a poor prognostic sign History of benign thymoma with local recurrence COPD with exacerbation Doubt bacterial pneumonia  Recommendation: Remdesavir 5 days Corticosteroids. Optimum dosing induration of corticosteroids has yet to be fully defined. Decadron 6 mg daily is reasonable however if develops progressive disease in the next 24 hr would escalate corticosteroids and would also add IL 6 inhibitor Additional minerals and vitamin supple role is unclear but probably benign If thrombocytopenia worsens may need alternative anticoagulation. Would check venous Dopplers Supplemental oxygen for saturations greater than 88% Daily PPI unless anticoagulation intensified then would go to q.12 hours Would favor discontinuing antibiotics

It is swollen and hurts to walk on.; pain down the left side then nothing else but a little in the arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical information team. A 82-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9262; Expiration Date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in top of left arm on 26Jan2021 (at the age of 82-years) as 0.3 mL, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included: sinus disorder, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, cholesterol. She has had cholesterol for years. She has sinus problems on and off. She suffers from GERD. She was on a pill to help with the stomach prior, but not on it now. She took the last one on 30Jan2021. She had been on it for two months. She doesn&#39;t remember the name of the medication. It was a time released capsule. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medications included: ongoing simvastatin (20 mg at night) taken for blood cholesterol and unspecified vitamins. She has been on simvastatin (generic for Zocor) for about eight years. She was on Lipitor (strength: unknown) for years and changed to Simvastatin. She got off Lipitor because she felt like it wasn&#39;t doing what it was supposed to do. Caller doesn&#39;t have product to provide lot number. She hasn&#39;t been on it for 10 to 12 years. No vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient had pain down the left side then nothing else but a little in the arm. On 30Jan2021, the patient&#39;s right foot started to bother on the ball of her foot. It was swollen and hurts to walk on. The clinical course included: the patient got her COVID shot on Tuesday (26Jan2021). She did in the middle of the night have pain down the left side then nothing else but a little in the arm. Then on Saturday (30Jan2021), her right foot started bothering her on the ball of her foot. It was a burning sensation. Yesterday was very bad and she could hardly walk. It is swollen on the bottom of the ball of her foot and across the top where her toes are. Her son just kept calling and telling her to check her temperature and pulse rate. She took Tylenol (strength: 500mg, Lot number: HDAO52; she had only taken two of them and it expired on Feb2019. She took one yesterday afternoon and one last night when she went to bed), applied ice (off and on), and elevated it and the swelling didn&#39;t go down. She did elevate it above her heart. Again, this morning she has the same thing. She was having a heck of a time walking. It was very painful. She was hoping she can walk normal again. It was still painful today. If she accidentally bumps it, it hurts. It was swollen. It started 4 days after receiving the vaccine. Caller stated she no longer had the problem with her arm. She has recovered completely. It was only bothering her a little bit on the twenty seventh (27Jan2021), but nothing to be concerned about. Investigations included: She hasn&#39;t been able to taste for some time and had a COVID test in December and she was negative. She was still having trouble tasting and had a CT scan of her sinuses last week (results not reported). She will follow up with her doctor about that. The outcome of event pain down the left side then nothing else but a little in the arm was resolved on an unspecified date in 2021 and for other events it was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

An 82-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261; Expiration Date: 31May202, NDC: 59267-1000-2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 06Feb2021 at 12:00 as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing emphysema, ongoing breast cancer from 2007 (she did not take chemo, just radiation) and ongoing follicular lymphoma from 2014 (did not take chemo, just radiation. Cancer was in the bone marrow, said she didn&#39;t think that has anything to do with it, has had two operations) and bone marrow cancer. The patient previously took budesonide/ formoterol fumarate (SYMBICORT) she was using SYMBICORT, but her doctor switched it a few months ago, back to ANORO), prochlorperazine maleate (COMPAZINE) she takes a couple of times per month, takes 10mg when she feels nauseated and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) she takes when she needs it. Concomitant medications included furosemide (LASIX) at 40 mg, twice a day (one 40mg pill in the morning and one 40mg pill at night) from 1985 to an unspecified date and then increased to 80 mg, twice a day (two pills (80mg total) in the morning and two (80 mg total) at night) from on an unspecified date and ongoing for blood pressure; ongoing simvastatin (ZOCOR) taken for high triglycerides; umeclidinium bromide/ vilanterol trifenatate (ANORO). Patient thought she has been on Lasix since 1985 but can&#39;t remember back that far. She was taking Zocor for a long time and stated Anoro Inhaler was a fairly new medication. For Anoro inhaler, patient stated she pulls back the thing and didn&#39;t know, maybe it pinches a pill and inhales the white powder. Relevant family medical history included none and both parents were deceased. Patient stated that her oncologist does blood tests once every four months, a test for markers and stuff like that, CBC, metabolic panel and bloodwork every 4 months. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL3246, Expiration date: 30Apr2021, NDC: 59267-1000-2) via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 14Jan2021 12:00 pm for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that, the patient has very sexy legs, but she doesn&#39;t anymore, says she got lymphedema about 5-6 days after the second Pfizer vaccine in Feb2021. She was now going to physical therapy, to bear her out and try to understand what she&#39;s saying. Caller states 30% of the people there that have had cancer and had radiation, get the same side effect she has had, some people have it in the arms, she got hers in her leg, says she has intense swelling, called lymphedema, says her legs look like they belong on an elephant. Caller said at the physical therapy place, 30% of people who have come in for help had radiation treatment for some kind of cancer, all have different kinds of cancer, but the swelling, the lymphedema, was the side effect they&#39;ve all experienced. Caller states that no one has called Pfizer and let Pfizer know, states she won&#39;t take the booster, won&#39;t have anything to do with this, says it&#39;s too scary. Caller states she was an active person, never had a problem with legs swelling or anything like that and now, her look like legs that belong on an elephant. Caller states the correlation seems to be with radiation treatment, because she has bone marrow cancer, and other ladies have breast cancer, states the only thing we all have in common was different treatments but in her own case she had no chemo, but she did have radiation. It seems like with radiation this swelling was an after effect. Caller says it&#39;s 2 or 3 things, not just that they had cancer or radiation treatment, says those of us who had radiation also got this swelling. Caller states she never had any trouble with legs or anything, says she was an active person. States some people experienced this four days after the vaccine, says hers started six days after the vaccine, says she woke up one morning, and her legs were huge. States usually legs were smaller in the morning. Caller wonders what were the ingredients that causes swelling. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it, says like overnight turned a switch on and now her legs were going to be big and fat and ugly. Caller states the reason she&#39;s calling was because at physical therapy last Thursday, other people who had the shot had the same side effect, says the only thing the lady said, she wasn&#39;t sure if she was a nurse or not, was the relationship was not with the kind of cancer, but the radiation treatment and the shot has been causing this and wasn&#39;t surprised. Caller says she was told that about 30% that they&#39;re handling now had the Pfizer vaccine. Caller thinks that&#39;s all they gave in the state NC, no other vaccine here, says it just seems to be with this. Caller states the lymphedema, hers was in her legs, others have it in their arms, she doesn&#39;t know why it&#39;s happening. Caller states about six days after the second shot, she can&#39;t remember exactly what day, about six to seven days, she woke up one morning, and her legs were hurting like the devil in Feb2021, stated her legs were about six times the size they should be in Feb2021. Caller states usually in the morning, the swelling goes down, but this woke her up out of the blue like zap, says no warning, no nothing, just one day she woke up and that where it was. Caller states her doctor increased Lasix, she used to take one 40mg pill in the morning and one 40mg pill at night, increased it to two pills (80mg total) in the morning and two (80 mg total) at night. Caller states she is now only taking one-and-a-half-pills this morning, because she doesn&#39;t feel right and she was peeing too much in Feb2021 and was not feeling right. She doesn&#39;t want to get dehydrated. Caller states she has a doctor appointment 10Jun2021 and was going to tell him she was taking less because she was just so weak in Feb2021. Says she was weak because she&#39;s taking too much Lasix, states she was taking two 40mg morning and night. Caller states she was just concerned, she has big legs, fat legs, she calls them fat. The patient not visited emergency room. The events result in the patient visited physician office. Patient reported that she has had no shots for four months however she was going to get the high dose flu shot on 01Oct2021. No relevant tests were performed at the time of this report. The outcome of the events lymphedema and Legs were about six times the size they should be was not recovered and outcome for the other events was unknown.  No further details provided. Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information requested.

An 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 29May2021 11:45 (at the age of 82-years-old) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included sensitive skin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available): None. No other vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient had no other prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Family medical history relevant to adverse events was reported as none. There were no relevant tests done. On 29May2021, the patient received the first dose of BNT162B2. She had the worse reaction and didn&#39;t know what to do as she hedn&#39;t read about it and now she was reading it and added that she was not taking another one. She should have gone to the emergency room, but she was afraid they would admit her. She had read this paper on what she should, and she had almost every time. She went to her physician on 25May2021, and that they were giving the vaccine at his office and that it would be on the Friday (28May2021). Her physician had said that she needed to take the virus shot, but Friday (28May2021), it would be like to 12 o&#39;clock and she had been there on Tuesday for a physical. She said that they wanted her to make sure if she wasn&#39;t coming and reschedule. She said that she went to store on the following Saturday on 29May2021. After she got the shot, she sat there for 15 minutes and read a brochure and then stated that she had been there for 30 minutes. She was very warm that day and she went and did her little shopping and it was very hot. After she did all of the shopping that day (29May2021), she went somewhere else and when she did, she started feeling hot and it was hot outside and she thought she had better get out of the heat. She got home about 17:30. She got to feeling heat so bad and she sat on her porch which she always did before she goes in the house. She said later that day (29May2021), she started burning on left side of her head. Started burning like her head was on fire on left side of her forehead and it kept on. She had a sensitive skin, so she couldn&#39;t understand why it was burning so. She then stated that it was burning so bad she went to mirror to see what it was doing and added that the side of her forehead was red, like fire red, but it was &#34;kicking&#34;. Her son told her to put some cold compresses on it. She stated that she had been putting warm and that it had helped. The patient had rash forehead and she had put warm compresses on it and laid down because it was feeling so bad and she went back and looked in mirror and it had turned into fire and rash all across left side of forehead. She said she thought she must be having reaction to this shot. The patient stated that she loved coffee but hadn&#39;t even drank her coffee because she doesn&#39;t have any taste on 29May2021. She then looked at the information that was provided and the next day (on 30May2021), there was a big old sore like staph like someone had poured acid on her and for 2 days, she didn&#39;t put anything on her head to touch it. The patient considered the events feeling hot as serious and persisting, rash on nose as serious, rash all over the place as disabling, but then commented it was medically significant, nausea and vomiting had improved but was serious, eyes and face swollen up and pain on top of the forehead as very serious (even with her sitting, she could feel the pain arising on the left side), and sores on scalp and head as serious as serious. The patient experienced heat at night and added that it felt like something was hitting her on the side of her head. She tried to get some ease and she got and tried to eat some soup. She then went to the bathroom and threw up (confirmed it was on 01Jun2021). The patient was still having pain on the left side, top of forehead and added that it was &#34;shooting everything now and then&#34;. She then mentioned that it was coming back now. The patient then stated that it had been over a week and she was finally getting better. The patient stated that she wasn&#39;t going to the emergency room because they would want to admit her. She further stated that &#34;you could to the emergency room with a thumbtack and be put on Intensive Care Unit&#34; and reiterated that she wasn&#39;t going. The patient had rash in her hair and didn&#39;t want anything touching it as it was just painful and felt like a big old sore, like a scab. After two days on 31May2021, her eyes started swelling and almost shut the left. She applied Cortisone cream to rash on the 2nd day for one day only.  Doesn&#39;t not have it available.  No other treatment sought.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

She immediately went to her physicians office and was directed to the emergency room at hospital. She was admitted and received an unknown I.V. and an unknown injection. After 2 hours she was released and was given 2 prescriptions to receive at her local pharmacy. The swelling lasted for 3 days. Five days later she had an identical reaction but it was on her left side of her face. A month later her blood was tested and she has had an  abnormally low blood platelet count.

She had felt well and had been in her usual state of health, and was able to cook and enjoy a turkey dinner with 5 individuals on 03/07/21, but on 03/08/21 she began to develop progressive generalized weakness up to the point where she remained in bed for several days.  She could not support herself when attempting to rise from bed.  She noted poor PO intake with nausea, no vomiting.  Loose stools for several days, no noted stool blood.  Did endorse waves of lightheadedness and had fallen backwards three times in the prior week, reportedly due to poor balance when standing.  She was unable to elaborate regarding the falls but admitted to hitting her head at least once, unable to say if she lost consciousness or if she felt presyncopal symptoms before falling.  She had initially presented on 03/12/21 to ED for evaluation, workup negative, labs and imaging normal.  CT brain found no acute process.  She was sent home with arrangements for home PT.  She returned to ED 03/15/21 when symptoms had not improved.  In the ED she was found to be afebrile, significantly hypertensive, mildly tachycardic, &#43; orthostatic vital signs.  Labs significant for heme occult positive stool, proBNP 397, WBC 10.1, H/H 13.4/39.9, PLT 493, UA neg for infection.  COVID neg.  CXR found slightly increased interstitial markings.  MRI brain found no acute intracranial abnormality.  She was evaluated by PT and found to be unsafe to DC home as she could not ambulate without leaning backward and to the right and needed 1-2 assist.  She was admitted to HM service for further management.  She has remained consistently afebrile.  She continues to experience significant gait instability, cognitive slowing, and difficulty with finger-to-nose testing with noted dysmetria, no focal weakness.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a Contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was none medical history. Concomitant medication included atenolol taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Her leg was swollen and there was edema and there was a lump on the side and it was pink or getting red and she was on medicine (Clarification Unknown) for 7 days, twice a day and the leg is still (incomplete sentence), the edema has gone down some. The leg was still pink and it is tender to touch and if she stand on her leg for too long or walking around too much it hurts. She got pain. She was also sleeping whereby she was watching television and all of sudden she was sound sleep and she wake up over an hour or two after that and then she awake for a while but she have no trouble sleeping at night again. She had chest pain and it&#39;s not angina because that she did have (Further clarification was unknown if consumer had angina in past hence not captured on tab) but it&#39;s a sharp pain and it does not want her taking Nitroglycerin because it went away and it last for maybe (incomplete sentence) it just like a stabbed wound. She was dizzy. That&#39;s still, it&#39;s not like what it was but it is getting less but she was still dizzy. She cannot walk a straight line. She lived in an apartment house and she had to walk down the hall to go down the stair but she sometime had to stop because she was dizzy. she kind of lean against the wall for few seconds and then she continued on. Concern was not the word for it. It made her very nervous and the circulation was very poor in both feet now and one leg, the right leg that has the pink and still the tenderness in that leg. The foot turns very dark pink and the big toe that she had turned dark purple. She wrote everything down and she will say this at the time after the injection she did not have any problem until about four days later but she did have problem with doing my cross- word puzzles and doing her puzzles. She could not do any of her puzzles, nothing was computing in her brain (Clarification unknown) but that&#39;s coming back slowly, so is that to be expected. Start date of event: Consumer stated &#34;It was 4 days after the 5th, about 09Feb2021. She went there and saw a doctor an MD of course and she went there on 12th so it was a week later. She went because the pain was terrible. The outcome of events Leg is still pink and it is tender to touch; If I stand on my leg for too long or walking around too much it hurts, I got pain; Dizzy; is not recovered, all of sudden she was sound sleep; Cannot walk a straight line; Nervous; Circulation is very poor in both feet now; Foot turns very dark pink and the big toe that I have turned dark purple; Nothing was computing in my brain; pain was terrible was unknown, outcome of the other events was recovering. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

An 84-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiration date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 12Jan2021 14:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On Jan2021, her left arm was blue from her shoulder to her elbow and almost the whole circumference going under her arm. On Jan2021, she has a slight left arm swelling and left arm discomfort. The discomfort was bearable. The discoloration of her left arm has become bad. She was at the COVID-19 vaccine clinic, some nurses looked at her arm, and insisted she contact Pfizer and her doctor to report what happened to her arm. She has an appointment with her doctor the afternoon of 20Jan2021. Her second COVID-19 vaccine dose is scheduled on 02Feb2021. Her left arm swelling and discomfort is the same now, but her left arm discoloration is awful. Her left arm discoloration is the only change she has experienced since her first report. Her left arm discoloration is what she calls &#34;puce&#34;, clarifying hers is a purple, black, and blue color. The discoloration of her left arm is uncanny. The discoloration stops before her left elbow like a completely straight line drawn by a ruler. The discoloration continues from her left elbow up to her left shoulder for which the discoloration spreads out unevenly. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported events based on the known safety profile and temporal association   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Pfizer COVID vaccine was administered at about 12:30 PM. Patient called staff over around 12:35 PM due to facial swelling, flushing and voice change.  Benadryl was administered at 12:40 PM via IM in the Right Deltoid. At 12:45 PM pulse was 78, Respirations were 20, and BP was 118/84. At 12:50 PM pulse was 76, Respirations were 21 and BP was 140/90. At 12:55PM pulse was 72, Respirations were 19 and BP was 132/82.  Patient denied ambulance services. Stated that she felt better at this time. Monitored patient for a total of 30 minutes and stated she felt fine at that point. Patient was followed up with the next day. She stated that no more Benadryl was needed at home. She slept a few hours after and continued to have slight facial swelling that lasted for a couple of days. Patient is unsure if she wanted to get the 2nd dose, but wanted to keep her appointment for it still. Her doctor recommends getting the second vaccine dose and told her to just take Benadryl and Pepcid before the vaccine. We educated her about the possibility of getting that second dose at her doctor&#39;s office or at Hospital in order for her to have more immediate access to emergency care.

Patient approximately 1 week ago was bending over to pick something up and fell to the floor landing on her coccyx, and has had increased low back pain since that time.  Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.  Patient also had a urinalysis performed which shows negative for leukocytes, nitrate negative.  Patient was admitted to medical inpatient as it is deemed that she will need longer than a 2 midnight stay for cardiac monitoring and will work with physical therapy and occupational therapy for gait training and strengthening with relation to the compression fracture of her L2 fracture, and pain control.

                                                around her neck looks swollen; rash on neck is brown; itchy; worried; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 84-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Covid shot, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: Unknown, Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history included heart troubles. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication was heart medication. The patient experienced around her neck looks swollen, rash on neck is brown on 03Feb2021 and it was still ongoing and itchy, worried on an unspecified date. Patient stated she read information about a rash all over the body after the COVID vaccine. She has had none of the side effects. She read about severe allergic reactions. She does have a history or heart troubles. She was washing her hair on Wednesday, and she noticed around her neck it looked swollen. Like a little band around her neck. It could have been there before the vaccine. She called her doctor that same day and she said to call Pfizer, and that she thinks she should cancel the second one. She got her first COVID vaccine on 23Jan2021, and she is scheduled for the second 13Feb2021. She does take a heart medication. The place on her neck is not itchy. She knows the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. She sees her dermatologist for Basal cells and other things that are itchy. This place on her neck, if it is a rash, is brown not red. She gets a lot of those places on her skin. Her doctor told her to call Pfizer and then cancel her second appointment. She just wants to speak to medical information first. She doesn&#39;t even know if it is a rash. She hasn&#39;t had any side effects. Her arm didn&#39;t even hurt. This little rash is only on her neck. She had worked as a dental assistant. She is just worried now about getting the second shot. The outcome of event for itchy and worried was unknown and for other events it was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

An 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 mRNA VACCINE BIONTECH), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 21May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0161) (at the age of 84-year-old) as 2nd dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Afib (diagnosed with Afib five years ago) and memory problems. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 mRNA VACCINE BIONTECH), dose 1 administered in Arm left on 30Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) for covid-19 immunisation and had lumps down the front of the arm. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 22May2021, the patient reported now it got the lumps going down it and they are tender. The patient went ahead and received the second dose Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine and now its got the lumps going down it and they are tender. They are not really going down, still there. Wondering if there was some kind of anecdote to take care of it? The right arm was not as serious. The marks or lumps are sort of in the same places on both arms, like in the bend of the arm in the elbow. The patient doesn&#39;t know anyone else having this problem. Are these lumps on the caller&#39;s arms lymph nodes? The caller states she has been concerned about the lumps on her arms but not concerned enough to go to the doctor. The patient stated she has not talked to anyone at her primary care physician&#39;s office yet. The patient did not visited to emergency room or physician office. It was suggested the patient go to have the lumps looked at but the patient never did. The patient asked does Pfizer have options to get rid of the swelling, to treat it? Oh, Pfizer doesn&#39;t have anything for that, the patient was giving Pfizer a chance to treat it. No relevant tests done. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

A non-pregnant 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 13Apr2021 (at the age of 84-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidaemia (HLD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM2). Concomitant medications included regular prescribed medications for HTN, HLD, DM2 (drugs unspecified). No other vaccines prior to four weeks. Known allergies were unknown. No COVID prior to vaccination. Covid test post vaccination in May2021 was negative. The patient had no acute issues prior to her 1st COVID vaccine. In Apr2021, the started experiencing progressive weakness and poor appetite to the point of hardly being able to walk. The patient saw her primary doctor who ran some blood work and noticed she was dehydrated with mild elevated liver enzymes and WBC count. The patient was admitted to the hospital (for 21 days) for IV fluids and was on oral antibiotics. The patient started having some SOB and scans done indicated possible lung infection. The patient was switched to IV meropenem which did not help. The doctors also noted some lesions on her liver and a small mass in her lung (no biopsy was done cause she declined) which they said were suspicious for cancer. The patient then suffered a large ischemic stroke and she passed about a week later. The patient was feeling well before her vaccine and everything started to go downhill after her vaccine. AEs result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent covid test: negative in May2021. The outcome of events weakness, decreased appetite, unable to walk, dehydration, elevated liver enzymes, white blood cell count increased, short of breath, lung infection, hepatic lesion, lung mass, and lung cancer was unknown. The patient died on 27May2021 due to ischemic stroke and infection. An autopsy was not performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information  and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported suspicion on malignancy and BNT162B2 use is  unrelated while the causal relationship between the remaining events and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. There is limited information available which precludes a more meaningful assessment. However, the underlying conditions and the age of the patient maybe risk factors.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate; Reported Cause(s) of Death: ischemic stroke; infection

                                                My mother received the FIRST vaccine about 5:30 pm on Jan 13, 2021.  She did fine and went to bed without any issues at all.  When she awoke the next morning, she had a HUGE fever blister/cold sore on her bottom lip.   She had not had a fever blister in decades.  When she called me, I immediately took her Abreva.  She treated it with that 4-5 times a day for about 7-10 days.  It dried up and has finally gone away.  I just thought this was such an unusual reaction.  After doing some internet research and checking with several doctor friends, they had never seen or heard of this side effect.

Patient had received COVID vaccine shortly after noon day prior to admit on RUE. She reports that she had been experiencing some nausea as well.   She was admitted to the hospital for overnight observation secondary to transient alteration of awareness after she presented to the ED for arm swelling where experienced a syncopal episode lasting approximately 1 minute. She was monitored on cardiac tele which showed Afib with appropriate rate control overnight. For her left upper extremity swelling an U/S was done which was negative for thrombus, only a hematoma. Her arm pain was controlled and supportive with a compress. Patient had no further syncope, Afib rate controlled, and hemodynamically stable. Discharged home 2/24/21.

Started abating by Thursday 2/25/21 evening. Advised ice pack on arm, but pt. said it was too sore on day after dose given (Wednesday) to apply. Pt. took one aspirin on Wednesday morning. Advised her she could take a second later in the day. (Yesterday pt. stated she had taken a Tylenol. Today upon review she realized that she took an aspirin. Ibuprofen is also available. Advised pt. take an ibuprofen now over the phone as I waited. Taken at 8:13pm EST. No further medication taken on Wednesday. (Also encouraged ice pack on neck Wednesday for ongoing strong headache / neck pain yesterday. Pt. does not remember if she tried that. Head/neck pain resolved today.) Pt. states swelling today (Thursday) is mild-to-moderate, less than yesterday, but still noticeable. Doesn&#39;t hurt as much as it did yesterday, she says. She can now lift her arm without pain.

A little white dot appeared where needle was inserted. Arm swelled. Initially thought it was common. But was not getting better and was painful and made her not feel well. She went to the doctors thankfully a few days after and was advised that it was infected. Could have been dangerous for her if infection continued to move through her body.   She is now on antibiotics. This is strange to have an infection which makes us feel the needle was not properly sterilized? Something foreign entered at the time of that shot and we would like to have answers. The doctors could not even identify why this happened.  Company Pfizer..

                                                Severe and acute swelling of right hand. Hand was swelled to an extent that only the top first joints of the fingers were discernible and this prevented use or any movement of fingers. Swelling began on April 19th, late afternoon. Swelling peaked on the 20th very severe, and gradually subsided over following days. Now 10 days later, hand is again usable, with very little residual swelling, though still visible different from left hand.  Took Advil for 4 nights beginning on the 20th, and everything seems fine now. Despite 30 years of rheumatoid arthritis, no such swelling event or attack had ever occurred for any reason, so we believe it was related to the vaccine, and felt we should report it. But everything seems fine now. No other reactions or side effects were noted.

Then all of a sudden, she started getting infections on 28Mar2021, 8 days after she had the first vaccine. She got a real bad bladder infection then she went to the doctor and she got medication for that. She was with bladder infection then she came down with the viral infection. The patient reported that she has not even been going anywhere because of the virus and she has been staying home. She just goes to the grocery store and clinic to the doctor, that was it. The patient had an antibiotic for the bladder infection. Sulfamethoxazole was the name of the medication that was for bladder infection. They didn&#39;t give the medication for the viral infection. The patient reported that it was just a viral infection, it was not the Covid. Since then, she had her second dose of the vaccine on 10Apr2021 and from an unspecified date in 2021, her foot started, her foot swelled up and she didn&#39;t know. She takes lot of retention pills, so she thought maybe it was that. So she took her pills and everything and washed and start getting but the next day instead of the foot going down, the swelling went up to her leg and then the next day it went all away up to her hip. The swelling on the left side from the foot all away up to the hip. She went to urgent care on 21Apr2021 (reported as &#34;21st&#34;) and saw a doctor and she was tested and she had blood clots. Regarding lab test, the patient reported she had two infections and then she got the blood clot that was from her hip all the way down to her left leg to her ankle. She could not figure out that they called the test and what they tested. But they had a lab work done then one has a test, veins, and everything. She can&#39;t remember. The patient reported that her foot and her leg was swelled, her toes all over up to her leg swelled. She had a fat foot and a fat leg just one side. She would say since she has started taking medicines for that, she took the first dose at the evening of 21st (21Apr2021), the day she went to the urgent care, and she would say it was not any worse. The medication was supposed to break up the blood clot, but it was the big one from her hip all the way down to her foot. Just a little bit better. The outcome of the events was recovering.

On 27Jan2021, she had a sore arm for about 4.5 days, and it was difficult to sleep on that arm which was very sensitive to touch, and it turned a little red on 28Jan2021. She noted the soreness that night. She can lay on it now, it was sensitive in the center where the shot went in, but not bad. She was also tired that evening of 27Jan2021. She doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with it, but she got a cold sore, when she is stressed she gets a cold sore on her lip. This was noted yesterday (01Feb2020). She has medication for it from the doctor, and had to take for 3 days, and it usually clears it up. The cold sore was blistering, but she was susceptible to them with stress, so she was not surprised. Patient recovered from the event of tremor on 27Jan2021, turned a little red on 01Feb2021 and tired on 27Jan2021. Event sore arm was recovering while for the remaining events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Mar2021 16:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing multiple sclerosis , ongoing hypertension, ongoing diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing stent placed and spasms; and from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously had flu shot and feel a little bit sick, it hit her lot harder with the flu shot. Concomitant medication includes, unspecified, diabetic and hypertensive medication and medication for spasms. On 25Mar2021, 45 minutes to an hour after the patient&#39;s first dose, the patient felt like someone was choking her and felt like her jaw was &#34;getting large&#34; without physically getting large. The patient was not able to get out of her wheelchair, even though she was normally able to do so on her own, and her blood pressure systolically reached 170. Her mother was given &#34;excess water&#34; and was given her hypertensive medication &#34;a little early&#34; which caused her pressure to come down quickly. Based on this reaction that her mother had, caller would like to know if it was safe for the patient to receive her second dose of the vaccine. They stayed about 15 min at the drive thru to make sure there was no reaction. It was about a 30-minute drive home with traffic. It happened within the hour, right when she got in the house. The patient had a reaction to the first dose, and the caller wanted to know if it was safe for her to get the second. Within the first hour the patient felt like someone was choking her, she felt like her jaw was swelling, she felt extreme weakness and could not stand, and her blood pressure shot up. It shot up to 170, but she did not know the diastolic. The patient felt like she was choking so she was doused with water to push anything through in case that would help. Within a couple of hours, the patient started to feel better. They gave her excess fluids and gave her blood pressure medication a little bit earlier and everything came back down. She was frightened when this first occurred. The feeling of choking and the feeling of jaw swelling got better and went away within a few hours. The patient had multiple sclerosis so weakness is always an issue and mobility is always an issue. She knew her tolerance and what she could do. That day they had taken her in a wheelchair from the car to the house and she could not get out of the wheelchair, which was not normal for her. This happened within an hour of the shot. The weakness lingered the longest. That side effect did linger. It took a couple of days. She was using a Hugo again to get herself around the house and believes this extreme weakness has gone away. She was exercising on a stepper when the caller was talking to her. Caller did not believe there had been any lasting effects. Blood pressure shot up: Started within an hour of the vaccine. She had been hypertensive for quite some time historically. Her medication had been keeping it under control. They administered her dose early that day and it brought it down, it did not linger. The patient had been housebound since the pandemic started. The outcome of the event blood pressure shot up was recovering, while the outcome of the event couldn&#39;t stand was unknown; and the outcome of the rest of the events was recovered on 25Mar2021.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

Two nights later the same thing happened on my right foot.  Several of my toes ended up with scabs on the tips of the toes.  My dermatologist told me that my toes had hemmouraged on the inside and the scabs were a result of that.  She had not seen anything like that.  I have  looked at all the images of Covid Toes on the internet and have not seen any with scabs on the tips of the toes.

Her whole upper arm became swollen (inflammation) and somewhat &#34;hot to the touch&#34; and was reddish in coloring. The inflammation did NOT look like a golf ball, but rather like a small hill on her upper arm, with a slope. After that, she reported to me .... that she was getting &#34;winded&#34;, on walks with her best friend. They both live in a senior citizen residence center, which is NOT an &#34;assisted living&#34; facility. Now, the swelling (inflammation) is gone. My mother has now had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine and yesterday .... she did NOT report, any adverse reactions (yet) from her second injection.

An 88-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198) at the age of 88-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 19Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization; losartan potassium (lot number: LJ5020047-A, expiration date: Aug2023), via an unspecified route of administration from 2011 to an unspecified date in 2021 at 50 mg, 1x/day for blood pressure high; diclofenac sodium modified-release tablet (lot number: PW6V5QFTAF61, expiration date: May2022), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date in 2021 at 75 mg, 1x/day for an unspecified indication; ibuprofen (ADVIL LIQUI GELS, 200 mg strength, lot number: CY1426, expiration date: Jun2022) capsule, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date in 2021 at 2-4 capsules, as needed (daily) for an unspecified indication; and aflibercept (EYLEA) injection, ophthalmic from an unspecified date to 11Mar2021 at 1 DF (injection), every 8 weeks in each eye for macular degeneration. Medical history included macular degeneration (the wet kind), blood pressure high, spinal stenosis, and thyroid disorder (reported as thyroid something) she provided that it was something like hypotramea (as reported). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) at the age of 88-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid on 29Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was calling about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and mentioned that she had a reaction but didn&#39;t think it was from the vaccine because it was 5 weeks to the date after the second shot. The reaction was very severe, and she had to visit the emergency room. The patient experienced throat closing, tongue swelling, face swelling and a hard time breathing. She saw her primary care provider after that, and she also saw her PMR doctor- physical medicine and rehabilitation. The doctors recommended that she report this reaction to the COVID 19 vaccine five weeks later. Both doctors thought it might be from the vaccine and it was worth reporting. When asked about the symptoms and if they occurred at that same time, the patient stated yes, and they diagnosed her symptoms as angioedema in the emergency room. This happened on 26Mar2021. The patient was never admitted to the hospital. When asked if angioedema improved, worsened or was persisting, patient stated it was nonexistent now. The events happened after the second dose of the vaccine. The patient had to stop her medications because her primary care provider was unsure what may have caused this reaction, but it may be her medications. She has been taking losartan potassium for about ten years but now had to stop because angioedema could possibly be the result of that, even after ten years. She also had to stop diclofenac sodium because they may have caused that kind of reaction. Having to stop ibuprofen broke her heart as she has taken it for years. This too could have that type of reaction. For aflibercept, she mentioned that she gets the injections in both eyes every eight weeks. She had it 31 times in the right eye and 30 times in the left eye. The reaction she was speaking of, the emergency room, came exactly 2 weeks after she had her last injections, which was on 11Mar2021. Angioedema was an emergency situation, if the throat closes and they couldn&#39;t open it up, they may cut into the neck and windpipe. The description was enough to scare her. Both doctors suggested the Pfizer vaccine as just possibly a late reaction. The patient had a basic metabolic panel while in the emergency room. She reported that potassium and sodium was low. Chest Xray- the patient did not have a report on it. Nasal scan was fine. COVID nasal test was negative. Swab for many other kinds of viruses was negative. All of these tests were done on 26Mar2021. The action taken in response to the events for losartan potassium, diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, and aflibercept was unknown. The outcome of the event &#34;potassium was low and sodium was low&#34; was unknown and recovered on an unspecified date in 2021 for the other event.

Later the daughter admitted that she had had increased weaknesss and confusion for a few weeks.  She was seen in her PCP&#39;s office and diagnosed with a UTI and gout.  The x-ray of her knee later showed a fracture of her proximal tibia.    A few days later she was brought to the emergency department with a wide complex tachycardia and acute coronary syndrome.  She had an 11 day stay complicated with congestive heart failure, hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia and metabolic encpehalopathy.    Her daughter thinks that this was brought on by the vaccine, and asked us to fill out a vaers.
