Tried cold pack and used Ibuprofin several times especially when waking up during the night with tremendous pain.  Sent to urgent care  on third day.  Wasn&#39;t sure what was causing it but prescribed some Prednizon for inflamation.  Swelling gradually went down beginning on 4th day and completely  back  to normal about 2-3 more days.    Am cautious about the 2nd shot which is usually stronger.

                                                Approximately 2 days after receiving her vaccine, she began to develop swelling and tender spots on both legs, mostly around the knees. These spots continued to grow in size, swelling and got more red in color. She developed more around the ankles. Edema of both legs worsened. approximately 20 days after receiving the vaccination she developed a similar spot over the right thumb. She also complained of scratchy throat, especially when lying down at night although she is noted to have chronic allergies. On March 25, she was re-evaluated. Given that her symptoms were worsening, and lab tests were abnormal she was treated with prednisone.

                                                She got her 2nd vaccine, and almost immediately into her shoulder had pain in her shoulder blade and into her neck and had a lymph node on the right side of her chin/upper neck, then she has another one that is smaller and back further, and possibly a third one that is almost to the right side of her neck, tiny in nature.  None on the left side at all.  She felt that they would eventually go away and didn&#39;t do anything about it.  She went to see her Dr., and he did a neck scan on 4/7/21, and reported that it was not cancer and told her to watch it, but if they were there in 4 months that they would have to be removed, they are still there.    They have not changed in size.  She has not gotten any more either.  She definitely can feel the two and the third one is there but tiny.   Her arm is still very sore at the site of the shot at the muscle.  Almost daily at the site it gets very very sore and she gets chills and has to lie down due to exhaustion that lasts about 40 minutes and has to go lay down and then she gets back up once the chills pass.   She was having it every day at noon almost every day, and still continues pretty much on a daily basis, but the arm is still very sore.

A 92-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm up at the top on 13Feb2021 at 10:00 or 10:15 (Lot Number: EN6200) (at age 92 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received shingles shot for immunization. The patient&#39;s son said that a week and a half after receiving the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, the patient developed shingles and severe pain. He wanted to know if his mother should still go ahead and receive the 2nd dose. If so, how long does she have to wait to receive it. He said his mother received the 1st dose on 13Feb2021, and was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 01Mar2021 or 10Mar2021. After the shot, a week and a half later (Feb2021), the patient got what the doctor thinks is shingles. The reporter and patient didn&#39;t know if she should get the second vaccine.  The shot was not given by her doctor or at his office. The patient was healthy before and she&#39;s in quite a bit of pain, should she get the next shot because she&#39;s worried about it.  The patient&#39;s second dose was scheduled already on 10Mar2021 but hasn&#39;t been able to get a hold of the place when calling them. The patient had the shot on 13Feb2021, on Monday 22Feb2021 the patient had sharp pain that would come and go behind her right ear. Patient stated she hates the pain. The patient had swelling in the lymph nodes behind her right ear a couple of days later. On 23Feb2021 the pain continued off and on behind the patient&#39;s right ear and she was having trouble sleeping. On 24Feb2021, the patient went to the doctor and he prescribed antibiotics because he wasn&#39;t sure that&#39;s what it was. There were no spots on the patient yet, the patient had more pain than before in the back, but she did not have a rash or swollen lymph nodes. The patient&#39;s lymph nodes were swollen in the back of her neck Thursday night (25Feb2021). The pain continued, it was more severe. The patient developed a rash on Thursday (25Feb2021). Friday the doctor prescribed the medicine for shingles. On 28Feb2021, the pain was radiating in her ear and behind there, you&#39;ll see her wince. The patient didn&#39;t get red blotches yet. Monday and Tuesday the pain was sharp, kind of sticks and then it was gone, it came and went, yesterday it was constant all day and Saturday it wasn&#39;t constant. Saturday the pain was constant. Thursday you could feel the knots in the lymph nodes, they have gone down some today. There is a little improvement in the patient&#39;s ear lymph node swelling. The patient has ear pain. The doctor looked in the patient&#39;s ear on Wednesday the 24th, the pain radiates, on the outside and the inside, it&#39;s just pain, shoots there and behind there. The pain has gotten worse over the week. The pain is intermittent, not constant and when it comes it&#39;s really sharp, she&#39;s had more over the weekend where its coming more often. The patient was having trouble sleeping starting Tuesday evening, it was fair but by Wednesday the trouble sleeping wasn&#39;t bad yet, the patient was still able to sleep, she has had to sleep sitting up, but by Wednesday, she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep well. The patient states that she has slept better now that she&#39;s on medication, last night was the first time she slept well. The shot was given in the left arm, all of this is on the right side. The patient has had no vaccines before, she wasn&#39;t sick before this. She still has the rash all over, the rash is behind the patient&#39;s ear, all down the back side of her neck, side of the neck, up into her hairline slightly, on the right side of her face, on her collar bone, and a little on her back. People say they got a bad case. No further clarification provided. Reports these are pretty big blotches (Feb2021). The rash was about the same, between Thursday, Friday and Saturday the patient developed more of them. With the rash, the reporter noticed more on Friday and Saturday. Today the rash is there but it has not changed. For her history, the reporter stated she&#39;s on normal medication, she didn&#39;t have anything before this. The patient is not in a nursing home, resides in her own home, not in a facility, she&#39;s is able bodied to stay at home. The patient is mentally alert, walks with a cane when needed, she does everything on her own.  The patient&#39;s doctor sent her for x-rays behind her right ear and face, facial, shoulder, and behind the ear area, behind the neck area on 24Feb2021. The patient&#39;s doctor&#39;s office called and said it showed arthritis. The reporter states that this pain is not from the arthritis.

                                                94 yo F presented from assist living with slur speech for 1 day, last seen well on 1/30. Pt has a PMH of dementia (Baseline, she will keep saying, &#34;help me, help me&#34;, AOX3, using walker, could go to bathroom by herself), hx breast cancer (s/p lumpectomy, chemo, Tamoxifen, currently not on tx), HTN, HLD, vaginal bleeding (no further work up by family), overactive bladder (on solifenacin), hx of MI (undocumented, no PCI or CABG), spine stimulator placed. According to patient&#39;s daughter, she saw her January 30, she was doing okay after the vaccine. On  1/31 when the daughter called her on the phone, she knows she has some slurred speech, when she saw patient in the facility, she noticed her gait becomes unsteady.  She decided to bring her to the hospital.  1/30, she noticed the patient has spilled up some water, otherwise denies fever, chills, shortness of breath, pain,  chronically, she has constipations taking laxative.  In the ED, pt was afebrile, 36.1, heart rate 85, blood pressure 130/61, respiratory rate 18, saturations 98 on room air.  Labs shows, sodium 134, potassium 3.6, bicarb 28, BUN 18, creatinine 0.97, glucose 119, WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 11.8, platelet 239.  PT INR 1.09, COVID negative. CT head suggestive of subacute infarct. Possible including small vessel ischemic changes. Chest xray questionable patchy left retrocardiac atelectasis or pneumonia. EKG shows atrial fibrillation&#39;s heart rate 71, QTc 610.  Case was discussed with neurology in the ED, patient was not a TPA or embolectomy candidate. CT head suggestive of acute/subacute cerebellar infarct.  Patient does not have any residual or sensory deficit except expressive aphasia. Neuro saw patient,  mentioned patient appears to have had a stroke that by the CAT scan criteria is already subacute.  The patient was admitted on the stroke pathway.   The patient has new onset atrial fibrillation and therefore should be considered for anticoagulation.  The patient cannot have an MRI of the brain due to her spinal cord stimulator but given that the stroke is already subacute on the CT without any signs of hemorrhagic conversion she could be started on this at this point.  If she gets started on anticoagulation the aspirin should be stopped. If the patient cannot go on anticoagulation or does not want to then she might be a candidate for dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention. 2D echo shows normal ejection fraction of the left ventricle estimated at 70 to 75%.  Regional wall motion abnormality was not observed.  Right ventricle systolic function is normal.  Moderate aortic stenosis. Cardio was consulted for anticoagulation,  From cardioembolic prevention standpoint, anticoagulation is recommended to prevent CVA. However, she has significant risks for bleeding given recent vaginal bleeding (investigation not pursued to spare her comfort), age, comorbidities, etc. Again, further discussion between family and primary team is required regarding risks vs benefits. Was evaluated by speech-language pathology present minimal oral dysphagia no overt clinical signs of aspiration, recommended to continue with NDD 2 diet/thin liquid. Patient was discharged to ECF.

That next morning early, she had a 911 event at her assisted living apartment and was sent back to the hospital, having had another heart attack. Patient died on the following Thursday, February 4, 2021. I do not know if the vaccination had any cause for my mothers death; but I feel it is necessary to report this series of heart attacks after she received the pfizer vaccine. Her Certificate of Death records the cause of death as &#34;Coronary Artery Disease&#34;.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 94-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL8982; Expiration Date: May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included amlodipine besilate, benazepril hydrochloride (AMLODIPINE BENAZEPRIL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient reported that she noticed after 2 or 3 days, she can&#39;t remember when she got a lump on her neck, &#39;she got the drug then the lump&#39; (not clear nor clarified) then she had the second shot because she thought you know she didn&#39;t pay no attention to the lump. Second shot on the 12th and she still have the lump, so she went to the hospital and had a scan, she had dye put in her, they can&#39;t find nothing wrong with her and she was just wondering is it possible that this is one of the side effects. She had both shots. One was on 22Jan2021 and then on 12Feb2021. It was the Pfizer shots. She had no reaction and felt great. Her arm didn&#39;t hurt. She got a lump not on the side she got the shot but the other side of the neck. It is on the right side of the throat. The lump was smaller and seems bigger now. She noticed the lump about 2 to 3 days after she got first one. She didn&#39;t say anything to them because she wanted the second one. The shot was given on the left side, but the lump is on the right side. Sometimes it is below the chin and sometimes it seem in the middle. It seems like it moves. She can&#39;t see it when she looks in the mirror. Other people can feel it. She went to the doctor who sent her to hospital to get a scan. The lump was 9 x 20mm. The doctor said they should go further and get MRI with the dye. From that he couldn&#39;t find anything. He even checked the sinuses. Nothing is coming from her head or ear. There is no infection. They are kind of baffled. They sent her to the dentist to make sure it is not like an infection in the teeth. The dentist is also baffled. He is not stopping because he is concerned. He sent her to an oral surgeon. The oral surgeon doesn&#39;t want her to worry because of her age. He is not sure either. The oral surgeon didn&#39;t want her to do anything invasive. He said to wait until 16Mar2021 and come back and let him look at it. If he is still concerned and they will do biopsy. No one mentioned cancer but she is concerned and scared. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included investigation: unknown results on Jan 2021, magnetic resonance imaging: no reason for it or infection on an unspecified date, scan: can&#39;t find nothing wrong with me  on an unspecified date, x-ray: no reason for it or infection on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event which included hot packs. The outcome of the event was unknown.Second dose given on 12Feb2021, lot number: EL9266, expires May 2021.

                                                I am the discharging physician and did not admit her but based off the information at admit: the patient received her Pfizer vaccine and developed nausea during her observation time but it was not significant enough to cause concern for the family. They took her home in good spirits and she appeared to be doing well until the evening when she became unresponsive. She developed high fevers and came to the ER with low normal O2 saturations and evidence of sepsis. Blood work showed a markedly elevated white count and an elevated lactic acid of 8 along with an elevated renal function and cardiac enzymes without EKG changes (multiorgan failure). Her COVID test was negative.  Blood and urine cultures were negative. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated no acute findings but likely chronic fecal impaction.  CT Head was negative for bleed or stroke. At this time is is unclear as to what was the cause of her symptoms but we believe it was presumed bacterial sepsis but this diagnosis is in question as all her cultures were unremarkable. The family opted on comfort measures rather than aggressive intervention and she was sent home with hospice.  Since it occurred so closely after receiving the vaccine I think it was worthwhile to bring it to your attention.
