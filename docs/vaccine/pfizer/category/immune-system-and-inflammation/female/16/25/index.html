It was slightly itchy but not painful. 2. The area on her back worsened over the next 2-3 weeks and developed dark black scabs. 3. 24 hours after the second vaccine dose (which was given on 2/20/21), she developed scattered lesions on her neck, hairline, ear, face ? some with blisters, some with scabbed tops. Again slightly itchy but not painful. She also had a transient headache and chills that resolved on their own that same day.

She woke up about 14 hours later with vaccine side effects the family was prepared for, including headache, chills, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. This all resolved within 48 hours. Approximately  one week later, the child woke up again in the night with severe chills in the middle of the night. It was a sudden onset following a week of feeling well. She had to sit in a warm/hot shower for an hour to get warm. She described it as &#34;freezing to death.&#34; She has never experienced anything like this before.

The arm also developed a rash. Patient was monitored by paramedics, who confirmed her pule, oxygen levels and blood pressure were normal. Conditions improved after about a half hour, but did not resolve completely. Arm is still slightly swollen (after providing Benadryl) and is very painful around injection site, 24 hours later..

Her reflexes were 2&#43; in her BL UE and LEs.  Pediatric Neurology and ophthalmology consulted and followed patient. Eye exam remarkable for bilateral cranial nerve 6 palsy but no other element of CN3 palsy and bilateral dilated but unreactive pupils. Patient treated with IVIG 1mg/kg/day x2 days for likely miller fisher syndrome variant of Guillain-Barre.

                                                Pt. received her second Pfizer dose at 3pm. By 11:30pm she had significant swelling on both of her eyes, mouth, and the start of red splotchy skin on arms and legs. We took her to ER. They gave her 50mg of hydroxizine and sent us home. 5min after leaving the ER at 12:30am on 4/23 she felt a golf ball sized lump in her throat and was having difficulty breathing. We brought her back to the ER.  At this time they gave her an ekg, and at around 1:30am gave her an epi pin and an oral steroid. Within 5min of the oral steroid and epi pin she no longer had difficulty in breathing and the lump in her throat was gone as was the res splotches. By 5am the swelling in her face had reduced drastically to 90% normal in her left eye and 70% normal in her right eye and 70% normal in her lip. She was released from the ER at 5:45am and went home to sleep. At 11:30am on 4/23 her swelling in her face remains the same and she is complaining of a headache. She was given 50mg more of hydroxizine.

The skin that is affected is swollen.  Benadryl taken orally did not help decrease the rash, nor did topical Benadryl. She also complains of pain to her left leg from her hip to her knee that intermittently bothers her starting 4/30 and still continues to bother her.   The day after the vaccine was given she had injection site pain, tiredness, extreme headache, fever of 101.8, nausea, chills, body aches.  No swelling or redness to injection site.  No lymph node swelling.

A 16-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 16-years-old) as a single dose on the left side for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. The patient had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccine. The patient did not take any concomitant medications. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced an inflamed supraclavicular lymph node on left side (same side as vaccine administration). On 26Mar2021, the patient visited her primary care physician (PCP) as a result of the event. The physician documented a 1 cm mass. The patient was referred to another doctor for follow-up. On 07Apr2021 the patient saw another doctor who reviewed the case. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included a COVID-19 nasal swab on 25Mar2021 with result of negative, chest X-ray on 26Mar2021 with results of &#34;clear&#34; and lab work on 07Apr2021 with results of &#34;clear.&#34; The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The patient was told to follow-up in six weeks if the nodule was not gone. The outcome of inflamed supraclavicular node was not recovered. The outcome of 1cm mass was unknown. The patient received dose 2 of BNT162B2 on 09Apr2021 at 13:30 and was told to contact the doctor with any changes in the lymph node (smaller, larger, etc.).   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained.

She was not able to eat and had nausea. Patient stayed at Hospital until May 13th and got many exams as endoscopy and colonoscopy and did not find any reason for such inflammation. Also, blood exams were ok. The swelling in the hands combined with inflammation on the bowel sound suspect of reaction of Pfizer vaccine as there is no event close to this date to create abnormal effects of swelling and inflammation.

                                                12 hours post vaccine she had severe myalgia, rash on both arms and legs, headache, nausea, stomach pain, and mild swelling in legs. Over the next 48 hours the rash darkened and spread to the entire body causing pain in her skin. The myalgia became nearly unbearable and both Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen didn&#39;t put a dent in the pain. One side of her face swelled so that one eye could only partially open. The nausea and stomach pain worsened so that she couldn&#39;t eat. Headache became intense. By 48 hours post vaccine she became delirious - her speech was slurred and difficult to comprehend. She would fall asleep for a few minutes and wake up unaware of where she was or what was happening. She never got a fever but did have chills. Around this time I called a relative who is a doctor to seek advice and Diphenhydramine was recommended. Benedryl helped immensely. 30 minutes after taking it she could speak clearly, was more alert, pain became tolerable, and her appetite returned. Symptoms and swelling returned when the Benedryl wore off so she continued taking it every 4 hours for the next two days until it wasn&#39;t necessary any more. The myalgia, stomach pain and headache persisted for 7 days. At 8 days post vaccine (today) a mild headache, mild and intermittent stomach pain, and mild fatigue are her only remaining symptoms. Her pediatrician cannot see her until next week but we have an appt for the 22nd.

A 16-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, SINGLE dose (at the age of 16 years old) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma from 2018 and ongoing (Has been asthmatic about 3 years and has it under control and hasn&#39;t had issues in years).

On 21Apr2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing and face swelling. They are not sure if it (anaphylactic reaction) is related to the vaccine. She does not have any allergic issues of any kind and is not sure if it is from the vaccine. The patient has an appointment with an allergist on 05May2021. The pediatrician recommended she wait to get the second dose until after the mother talked to the allergist. She is scheduled for the second dose 30Apr2021. The consumer stated the daughter will miss her second dose tomorrow. The pediatrician told her to wait until speaking to the allergist. If the allergist clears her, it wont be until 05May2021. How long would it be until she can get the second dose. She is not sure if it is related or not. It was 2 weeks after. She ate some kind of granola bar that may have been the cause. Before she called 911 and they gave her epinephrine, it lasted anywhere between maybe up to 15 or 20 minutes. She went to the emergency room (ER) and had to be observed 4 to 5 hours and then went home. Treatment for the events included Epinephrine, steroids and she believes a dose of Pepcid. She was on steroids for like 4 days. The steroid was prednisone. Outcome of anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing, face swelling were recovered on 21Apr2021.

Family had given benadryl and zyrtec without improvement, and symptoms were worsening to presents for evaluation.     My exam (after Epipen) showed: Gen: nontoxic appearing; HEENT: no lip/tongue/uvular edema, PERRL, EOMI, normal conjunctiva, neck supple without LAN; Card: RRR, no murmur, good perfusion; Lungs: CTAB, good air entry, no increased WOB, no wheezing; Abd: soft, non-tender, non-distended, no masses; Ext: warm and well perfused, moving all extremities; Skin: hives over hands, arms, abdomen, and legs, including between fingers and on soles of feet     Patient presenting with allergic reaction after Covid vaccine, could be more benign allergic reaction such as urticaria multiforme, but given constellation of symptoms and history of severe allergic reaction in past, will treat as anaphylaxis. Therefore given Epipen, steroids, and will plan for observation.   Observed 4 hours and continued to be well appearing without symptoms of rebound anaphylaxis. Therefore, patient safe for discharge to home with supportive care and PCP follow up. Given Rx for benadryl and steroids, refilled Epipein. Family in agreement with plan and verbalize understanding of signs and symptoms to return to care.  Final Diagnosis  1. Anaphylaxis T80.52XA

My joints were hurting, I had somewhat severe nausea, my head started throbbing. At about 6:40 AM my migraine started, my arm felt hot to the touch, and I got dizzy so I took some acetaminophen. At 10:00 PM I noticed the area under my left armpit was a little swollen and really sore, my throat and right tonsil was also sore and it hurt to swallow. The next day (today) I have another migraine, my throat and left armpit are still sore,  and my muscles hurt. I?m getting better though.

                                                Vaccine administered at outside facility. Patient is a 16 yo girl, admitted on 4/19 with myocarditis, s/p IVIG (4/19) after presenting with progressive new onset chest pain. She was in usual state of health up until 2 days ago when she started developing body aches, and chest pain. Patient received her 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine last week (4/15). No known history of COVID infection. Parents brought her to the ED yesterday after she complained of dizziness, SOB, chest pain, and had a near syncopal event. EKG showed non-specific ST abnormalities with labs showing elevated troponin, mildly elevated CRP, normal CXR, negative COVID PCR. Denies fever, GI symptoms, GU symptoms, headache, rash. Once transferred to our PICU, she was worked up for myocarditis vs MIS-C. Troponin has been trended q6 and is trending up (now 11). Of note, there have been no fevers. Patient is a 16 yo girl, s/p admission (4/19-4/23/21) with myocarditis, s/p IVIG (4/19), has now been readmitted on 5/10 with myocarditis after presenting with headache and neck pain for 2 days. Following discharge from the PICU on 4/23, patient states that symptoms have lingered (low grade fevers, feeling tired, on and off chest pain). After developing a progressive headache and neck pain, she came back to the ER for re-evaluation. Upon readmission, her troponin was elevated (2.06 on 5/10). Her CBC and CMP were reassuring. Blood culture collected on 5/11 and urine culture collected on 5/10. ID consulted for workup.

                                                Patient admitted with myocarditis s/p dose #2 of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  At the time of the report, she is still hospitalized. From EHR note: Patient was in her usual state of health when she received her second dose of the Pfizer mRNA Covid vaccine on 6/3.  She experienced mild myalgias in the day following the vaccine.  However, on 6/5 she developed new severe substernal chest pain, dizziness, and dyspnea.  Pain radiated to her throat.  Given severity of pain, she presented to the emergency department.  In the ED she was afebrile, tachycardic, and initially hypertensive.  Labs demonstrated WBC 10.9 (N 49, L 27), Hb 11.7, PLT 315.  ESR 25, CRP 7.61.  Troponin T was mildly elevated at 0.08, consistent with mild cardiac inflammation.  SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing were negative. An EKG was normal. However, an echo demonstrated low-normal LVEF (55%).  Otherwise, patient denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, new rashes, arthralgias. Patient was admitted to the cardiology service for further monitoring.  Following admission, she was started on ibuprofen.  She notes that her substernal chest pain has improved somewhat since admission.  Differential for patient&#39;s presentation includes infectious, post-infectious, and non-infectious causes of myocarditis. Although post-vaccination mild myocarditis seems likely, we agree with the infectious workup already undertaken, and recommend additional EBV and CMV PCR testing.

The patient was hospitalized for myocarditis from 19Apr2021 to 23Apr2021. The patient was hospitalized for other events for 6 days. The adverse event result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Emergency room/department or urgent care. Clinical course as follows: patient is a 16 yo girl, s/p admission (19Apr-23Apr2021) with myocarditis, s/p IVIG (19April) after presenting with progressive new onset chest pain. She was in usual state of health up until 2 days ago when she started developing body aches, and chest pain. Patient received her 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine last week (15April). No known history of COVID infection. Parents brought her to the ED yesterday after she complained of dizziness, SOB, chest pain, and had a near syncopal event. An EKG showed non-specific ST abnormalities with labs showing elevated troponin, mildly elevated CRP, normal CXR, negative COVID PCR. Denies fever, GI symptoms, GU symptoms, headache, rash. Once transferred to our PICU, she was worked up for myocarditis vs MIS-C. Troponin has been trended q6 and is trending up (now 11). Of note, there have been no fevers. Upon readmission, her troponin was elevated (2.06 on 10May). It was unknown prior to vaccination the patient diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient tested for COVID-19. covid test type post vaccination: Blood test. covid test name post vaccination: SARS COV2 ANTIBODIES QUALITATIVE on 19Apr2021, covid test result: Positive. covid test type post vaccination: Nasal Swab, covid test name post vaccination: Respiratory Virus Panel by PCR on 19Apr2021, covid test result: Negative.  Information on the Lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported myocarditis with chest pain, body aches, dizziness, SOB, near syncopal event and the abnormal lab data were possibly related to the bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), considering temporal relationship and the inflammation features.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

When probed for lab test: Reporter stated, she had not yet got them and was going to go tomorrow, because two weeks ago, the doctor said, it was allergy and was prescribed Zyrtec and Benadryl. It did not work so that was why they going to do blood work tomorrow because she took her again. It was mentioned that patient received Zyrtec one in the morning and Benadryl one in the night but she took like 3 days and it gave her headache (Further not clarify hence not captured as event) so she start taking it the other, she does not take it. The reported took her again and doctor took her blood to see what was wrong because they could not really tell, what could be better. The reporter mentioned that her daughter was a completely normal kid and after this vaccine just everything had become like another world.  The split case was identified after the call hence no further relevant information for the patients could be probed. Limited information was available over the call.  Follow-up attempts were completed. No further information was expected.

                                                Patient not seen in office.  History obtained via phone from father of patient and patient herself.  Very early on 4/19/2021, 8hrs after receiving her 2nd Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination, patient began developing nausea, chills, sweating, fever and malaise.  Highest fever was 102.3&#39;, with symptoms treated with Advil 600mg.  Had x1 episode of vomiting that day, none since. The next day 4/20, patient woke up with new-onset lip swelling, progressing to periorbital swelling and swelling of her facial cheeks &amp; rash.  She then began having a cough with some throat tightness with some mild discomfort with breathing in her throat, but no chest tightness or wheezing.  Tongue not swollen per patient.  Benadryl 25mg PO given multiple times and patient used her Albuterol MDI a few times as well, which helped.  She continued to have fevers to 101&#39; throughout the day, treated with Advil again.  At night, patient then developed semi-itchy red &#34;hives&#34; on her legs. Per patient, she didn&#39;t feel she needed to go to ER for her symptoms or throat tightness/breathing issue.  She was still drinking &amp; urinating well  and had been consuming light solids foods. The same day 4/20 in the afternoon, patient was prescribed over the phone Prednisone 60mg PO x1 which she first took after 5pm, with tapering dose over the next 4 days, in addition to increasing Benadryl to 50mg PO and starting Qvar 80 MDI BID, while using Albuterol prn. Via phone call to father this morning 4/21, patient reportedly slept well last night and woke up this morning with significantly less symptoms.  No longer having throat tightness/breathing issues, with much less periorbital/facial swelling.  Still fatigued but no longer having fevers, either.

Today my left arm which I got the vaccine in, feels itchy and my hand is swollen and red. Now my left feet is starting to feel itchy and swollen-red.

                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

We were to start ibuprofen and ice, avoid any touching of the area, and monitor it for a few days. That was Monday, and it is now Friday. The lump is still there but it is slightly less painful. If it isn&#39;t better by Monday, we will see the pediatrician.

                                                Eleven days later, she got another allergic reaction with blister on her arm, water filled blister; She got blister on the opposite arm of the injection, on her right arm; Diagnosed her with a skin disease that happens when your immune system is under attack; Her arm is now swollen around the blister; bullous pemphigoid; cellulitis; Had an allergic reaction; Itchiness; They gave her a high dose/received a higher dose of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 17-years-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Apr2021 at 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ew0153) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma seasonal only during allergy season. No episodes this year. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  Concomitant medications included Multivitamin/women&#39;s one a day gummies. The parent reported that her daughter had the vaccine done on 10Apr2021 and she had an allergic reaction that evening, she had itchiness. So, I contacted the pharmacist that she had an allergic reaction and she told me that they gave her a high dose and there were few patients who got the high dose. So, eleven days later, she got another allergic reaction with blister on her arm, water filled blister, I took her to an urgent care and they referred me to a dermatologist that diagnosed her with a skin disease that happens when your immune system is under attack (event captured as per verbatim). So, I went to her primary doctor and her primary doctor has put her on antibiotic because her arm is now swollen around the blister, so now, she is on ointment, antibiotic and vitamin d (treatment) to bring up her immune system and also she has to get her blood work done to check her immune system. She also stated that the reaction my daughter is now having and how her primary doctor is suggesting not to take her second dose because she highly thinks it is an allergic reaction to the vaccine.&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered.         Reported Event: Four hours after the injection on 10Apr2021 (Name) entire body began to itch and the top of mouth. The pharmacist was notified and at the time and further explained that (Name) was one of the patients that day who received a higher dose of the vaccine at the time of injection. The pharmacist did not notify me of how high the dosage was. So I cannot put the exact details on this report because I was not given that information by the pharmacist. I suggest the pharmacist be contacted for the exact mistaken dosage. The second side effect was on 21Apr2021 (Name) woke up with a water filled blister on her right arm which ruptured with a yellow liquid. We seeked medical attention on 21Apr2021 and 23Apr2021 from 3 different facilities. The outcome was (Name) being diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid and cellulitis. (Name) was placed on cephalexin 500mg, vitamin d 50mcg/2000 units, mupirocin 2%, and fluconazole 150 mg to build her immune system back up.

A 17-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Colitis ulcerative from 2014 and ongoing, Genetic immune deficiency, additional Information for other conditions: Caller describes it as &#34;22q&#34;. patient was born with this but wasn&#39;t actually diagnosed until patient was 11 years old. They checked with patient&#39;s Immunologist before getting the vaccine especially with her daughter&#39;s history. Thyroid disease from 2015 to an unknown date, additional Information for other conditions: patient didn&#39;t have a thyroid- her thyroid was removed. Concomitant medications included cetirizine; famotidine; montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR); and epinephrine (EPIPEN) all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aloe vera, pramocaine hydrochloride (ATARAX ANTI ITCH LOTION) taken for itching, swelling and hives, start and stop date were not reported. The patient took first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12Mar2021 10:00 (Lot: EN6207) for COVID-19 immunization and patient had no side effects after the first dose. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient just saw her Immunologist and her Immunologist instructed her to report what is going on with patient. Caller clarifies patient&#39;s immunologist plans to call and report as well but also instructed her to call and report the side effects her daughter is experiencing. Her daughter was cleared to have the COVID vaccine. The caller explains they always check with her immunologist because of her daughter&#39;s immune issues. Her daughter received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 02Apr2021. On the evening of 04Apr2021, her daughter broke out in hives. They didn&#39;t think it was a big deal, they thought it was just an allergic reaction. She tried Benadryl and several other things. They went and saw her daughters regular general practitioner and the doctor believed it was just a delayed skin reaction, which seems to be common with the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The doctor told her he&#39;s seen one other person with this delayed reaction. He gave her daughter a steroid injection, a Steroid Dose Pack and Pepcid. She was also placed on Benadryl as needed. About 2 weeks after this, her daughter and lip and face swelling and ended up in the Emergency Room (ER). At this ER visit, they initiated the allergic reaction protocol and it was not an anaphylactic reaction at that point. Her daughter received IV Benadryl and IV steroids, the caller is not sure what else. She confirms she has no NDC, Lot number and expiry dates for the medication her daughter received in the ER. The ER doctor contacted the Immunologist on call and the Immunologist had seen a few cases with a delayed reaction. Caller clarifies the ER doctor discussed her daughter&#39;s delayed skin reaction with the on-call Immunologist. The oncologist put her daughter on generic Zyrtec, 20mg in the morning and 20mg at night. The following week, her daughter woke her up with facial and tongue swelling. She clarifies further her daughter had fever, joint pain, and had broken out in a rash that moved to her face and lips. She immediately took her to the ER. The ER followed the whole anaphylaxis protocol and was given an EpiPen. She explains her daughter was diagnosed serum/covid sickness. This has been going on for over 6 weeks. The reaction will come and go. She was told as her daughter&#39;s body develops immunity, she is basically allergic to it. She clarifies at her ER visits, they checked her daughters liver and kidneys. It was noted her daughter had and elevated CRP, which is an inflammatory marker. The caller was told they thought her daughter had serum sickness from the vaccine which may last 4-6 weeks or it may be prolonged, so they just went with it. They told her as long as it didn&#39;t move to her lips or affect her daughters breathings, eventually it would wax and wane and go away. Her daughter started breaking out on her arms and legs and last Saturday, she woke up and her face was swelling. She clarifies her daughter&#39;s eye started to swell and her tongue. She took her straight to the ER and the ER followed the anaphylaxis protocol and injected her with an EpiPen. They contacted her Immunologist to check and make sure it wasn&#39;t anything else and consulted with the Covid Vaccine Clinic and it was found 3 other patients had this happen. No further details were provided regarding the 3 other patients. Right now, her daughter is on 4 different medications and an EpiPen. They contacted her insurance about her being placed on a biologic because not even the current medications her daughter is on is making everything going away. Caller verifies her daughter was never admitted into the hospital. When she was last seen in the ER Monday, she her daughter was monitored for 4 hours after the EpiPen was administered. The events require a visit to Emergency Room (total of three ER visits) and Physician Office. She known the last/third ER visit was Monday, 17May2021. The second ER visit was 04May2021. She believes the initial/first ER visit was probably a week or so before the second one. She clarifies she broke out in hives on 04 Apr2021 and went to the doctor on 07Apr2021 or 08Apr2021 so the ER visit was around the next week. Since her daughter had such a good response from the EpiPen the ER doctor took pictures before and after. She clarifies the name of the biologic they want to put her daughter on is Xolair, it is a monthly injection. She explains the current cocktail they have her daughter on is not working. She provides the following product information for these 4 medications and EpiPen. Relevant Tests included she knows they are testing for any other thing that it could be to rule it out. She knows they ran a CIS-tray, a complete CIQ , a Histamine release something and Tryptase. She knows they checked her CRP (inflammatory marker) because it was elevated. Every time her daughter went to the ER, they did a CBC and all of that was normal except for the CRP inflammatory marker, however her CRP was normal at the last ER visit. The outcome of events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Parent had the patient give the description: The next morning, I had sore left side/left side of neck. Later on that day, I was feeling my neck and I felt a giant lump on the left side of my neck. I thought that I had slept on it wrong. Later on, it wouldn&#39;t go away - even with massage. It was painful. It caused disturbance, I wasn&#39;t comfortable when I was sleeping. It had gotten bigger the next morning. Our doctor said that it was lymph nodes and it was a response of immune system to injection. To make sure, I&#39;m getting an ultrasound. It has gone done but I still notice another smaller lump there still as well. (The two lumps are side by side.)  For the pain and swelling, the doctor prescribed me ibuprofen. This has calmed it down. It was still a little swollen - about two weeks after. But it&#39;s going down little by little. I still feel it, but it&#39;s now very small.

There was a lot of drowsiness; fatigue; upset stomach - lasted about a week.  Went to Primary care doctor; he said it was a side affect. He told us to keep an eye on it. The swelling lasted three or four days.

                                                The patient had an apparently spontaneous anaphylactic type reaction with facial hives, eye redness and swelling, diffuse hives on trunk, lips, and extremities, tongue swelling, difficulty swallowing, and itchy tongue. The only thing had had had to eat or drink was a cows milk latte with hazelnut 2 hours prior to the reaction. No fever. The family gave her 2 tabs of Benadryl (50 mg total) at home and brought her to urgent care whereupon her hives and tongue swelling had decreased substantially. They showed photos of her face and skin prior to the Benadryl. She was given 60 mg prednisolone and observed for over 30 minutes. She improved substantially and was discharged home with her mother pending results of allergy testing.

                                                Eight days after her injection, Raised bump  that looked like two mosquito bites about the size of two nickels  pushed next to each other; brief 99-101 F fever that lasted only an hour or two for two consecutive nights. Bump turned flat and area got to be more of a red spot in similar size. Resolved itself in 24 hours after redness.  Not serious but worth mentioning because I have read about this fairly uncommon side effect from recent NEJM article, but ghe article stated the effects were coming from folks who had the Moderna shot, and not the Pfizer.

                                                The day after the vaccine was received, the patient noticed arm and face swelling. She also experienced shooting pains and tingling in the same arm she received the vaccination. At work, it hurts when she carries things and has dropped items, which is unusual. Pain is mainly in the shoulder, but sometimes in the forearm. She has tried Tylenol, ice and naproxen with no relief. She received methylprednisolone on 4/12, and now feels that she is having an allergic reaction.  Complaints of increased wheezing, shortness of breath and swelling of her skin, she has used her albuterol inhaler at home which has provided no relief.   On 4/13 she received albuterol by nebulizer and an IV dose of methylprednisolone at the emergency department. She is going to start albuterol nebulizer at home, continue OTC antihistamine, discontinue the methyprednisolone and start prednisone tomorrow.

She was assigned a 30 minute wait time. She received her vaccine at 1225 on 14May2021, and approximately 15 minutes later developed itchiness around her mouth and face. She reported this felt similar to the beginning of her prior episode. Physician and nurse were notified, who evaluated patient. Patient?s airway was clear, respirations unlabored and normal to auscultation. Vitals were within normal limits. EMS was notified, and 50mg Benadryl was given at 1255. At this time patient?s reaction appeared minor and stable, so epipen was at patient?s side however not given yet. EMS arrived rapidly, and repeated eval, confirming same evaluation and history. Patient was transferred in stable condition to the ER for extended monitoring.

                                                within 34 hours of the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Covid shot, patient began to break out in welts/hives behind her knees. She woke up in the middle of the night with her scalp itching and her ears hot as well as the welts behind her knees. Given Benadryl which helped a little for about 2 hours but then the hives just kept spreading and growing into huge swollen itchy patches on her body. By Friday afternoon, she had tried Benadryl and calamine lotion only to have it continue to get worse. We ended up with the Urgent care by 4pm Friday, 4-30-21. They gave her Prevacid and prescribed steroid cream. They told us if it got worse or affected breathing to go ER. We went home and kept taking the benedryl every 6 Hours and using the steroid cream. as one welt would begin to disappear, others would pop up. the steroid cream did not help in that regard. the benedrul would give about 50% relief for about 2 hours before the itching got very bad. Unable to sleep to do anything, we took patient to the pediatrician that Sat morning 5-1-21. She examined her and told her to take Claritin in the morning and Zyrtec at night to help. She was hestiant to prescribe any steroids due to unknown interaction or affects with the Covid shot. She told us to keep checking in with her and also if it got worse or spread to her face/mouth or any trouble breathing to go to the ER. We went home and tried to take an oatmeal bath. It only made things worse. By 10pm that Sat night 5-1-21, the hives had spread to patient&#39;s face and lips and were affecting her throat. Her voice got very raspy. we decided at that point to take her to the ER. They started her on steroids that night. She continued taking the steroids for 5 days after that. The steroids did help make her hives go away. However, within 2 days of finishing the steroids, patient noticed that she still did not feel 100%. That Saturday 5-8-21, She began to feel light-headed and off. She also began to feel fatigued. She came home from an errand needing to lay down and feeling dizzy. A few days after that, she began to have gas and indigestion, feeling like something caught in her throat and feeling nauseous. She also noticed that there a few nights in all of this that she would wake up shivering for no reason. The shivering would continue until she woke up in the morning. This report is being filed on 5-30-21. Since her 2nd shot and after the hives, we have been dealing with ongoing dizziness, fatigue, tiredness, lightheadedness and nausea to varying degrees. She has not been able to resume regular activates of being active or working out. WE have been back to the dr.

A 18-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0150; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 07Apr2021 13:30, as 1st dose, single dose and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0171; Expiration Date: was not reported ) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 28Apr2021 12:30, as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included colitis ulcerative from 2015 and ongoing. Additional Information for Other Conditions: states was in remission for 6 years prior to her second dose of the vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that she had a pretty severe reaction to her second dose of BNT162B2. States she has been in the hospital for 5 days last week and has now been in the hospital for 4 days this week because of side effects from vaccine that she received on 28Apr2021 which was her second dose. She thought the side effects would go away after the first hospitalization but was readmitted. First admitted to the hospital on 01May2021 for severe reaction to the shot for 5 days then was sent home because they thought the side effects would go away but the side effects have still been heavy. She was admitted again on Friday (14May2021) to the hospital from the side effects that are continuing. States she had lost 14 pounds from the time she was home from her first visit to the hospital. Patient vomiting a lot and couldnt hold food and water down: States that right after she got the second shot a couple of hours later she vomited a lot and couldn&#39;t hold food or water down which started 28Apr2021 and that she hasn&#39;t thrown up since Friday 14May2021, but has improved. She was starting to recover from it, it was just starting to get better. The really bad diarrhea started on the 28Apr2021 and was ongoing. The doctor thinks the second dose of the vaccine caused an ulcerative colitis flare up. She noticed the tachycardia on 29Apr2021. States her resting heart rate before the vaccine was 55 on average and now her resting rate was 105-115, and when she gets up to walk around it was 140-160. States that this was what was preventing her to be able to leave the hospital now. Tachycardia was the reason for admission for the first hospitalization. she was at urgent care she was tachycardic and her throat and glands were all swollen and they thought she needed to be admitted to the hospital. Swollen glands recovered last week, either 12 or 13May2021 and was completely recovered from that. Clarifies throat and swollen glands recovered 13May2021. Her dates of admission were 01May2021- 04May2021 for tachycardia. States she was currently at hospital and was admitted 14May2021 and was still there today for tachycardia and weight loss. States the tachycardia warranted both hospital admissions but the weight loss also contributed to the second admission as well. States her current weight was 116 after losing 14 pounds. She was weighed on the 4th when discharged from her first hospital admission and she weighed 130 pounds or 59 kilograms then had a follow up appointment with her cardiologist on the 14th for tachycardia and was weighed then and was 116 pounds at that time. They then sent her to the emergency room right after that follow up appointment to be admitted. States she hasn&#39;t been weighed again during this hospital admission so she thinks her weight was the same. She coughed and said sorry something got stuck in her throat, then continued her conversation. Ulcerative Colitis flare up- states she was unsure of when it transitioned from diarrhea to this flare up of ulcerative colitis. States she has just starting getting steroids and they increased her normal medications for her condition and was starting to improve. States she has a picture of her vaccine card and the events started after her 2nd dose. They did a procedure to confirm it was flare up at around 15:00 on 17May2021, performed a sigmoidoscopy and just found her left colon and rectum were inflamed as results which was similar to the ulcerative colitis flare up.

                                                Itchy, swollen toes progressed to elbows within the first few days. The rash slowly began reaching her knees, ankles and thumbs. This lasted for about one week. There were days with minimal presence of a rash but then it returned initially on the elbows and the backs of heels/achilles tendons. Over a course of 2 weeks, the rash has flashed up in various areas for a few days at a time. Today (5/9/21) there is swelling and redness on her feet (bottoms and sides) and her fingers. There is a tingly sensation with movement and her skin feels tight to move. She is due to have second vaccine in 3 days.

A 20-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: ER2613) first dose on 20Mar2021 10:15 on left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient is not pregnant. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination, No known allergies. She took the vaccine around 10:00am and around 6:00pm (also reported as 06:30 PM) she noticed that her left foot had swollen. She consulted with her general physician and he requested that patient did an Ultra Sound exam of her left leg. The result of the exam reported a small clot behind her left knee. Therefore, doctor suggested that she reported these events to Pfizer so an evaluation is made to identify if similar events have occurred with other patients. She was concerned if she should take the second shot on 17Apr2021. AE resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Patient received Eliquis 5mg (two times daily) as treatment. Patient had Nasal Swab on 01Apr2021 and tested negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 20-years-old female patient (daughter) received second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: ER8733, Expiry date: Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in right upper arm on 20May2021 13:30 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization.

Patient historical vaccination was Flu vaccine on an unknown date in Sep2020 for immunization and first dose of BNT162B2 lot Number ER8733, Expiry Date: Jul2021 on 29Apr2021 at right upper arm for COVID-19 immunization and patient experienced little sore arm but it was no big deal. On 20May2021 patient experienced sore arms, had chills, her hands were very cold and her fingernails were purple. For a 3 hour period she had low grade temperature of 103.2F. Her heart was racing very fast. The mother gave her Tylenol in 15ml liquid form at 04:00 am and the temperature went down to 2 degrees. Her heart was still racing very fast at 5am. 3 hours later at 08:00 am her temperature was 101.5 F more Tylenol was given but her heart was still racing fast. Later that day it settled down. Her temperature went down to maybe a hundred and heart rate was slowly settling down. The mother said that it was really scary. They had call the doctor on Friday and talked with the nurse two times and the nurse said that they never heard anyone experienced a fever that high with the vaccine. She is asking if this was normal and if anyone has experienced this before. She is asking if ever there would be a third or booster dose, can her daughter take it after experiencing side effects after the second dose. She went back this past Thursday 20May2021 around 1:30pm for the second dose and she felt fine. About 10 hours later that night, she started not feeling well. She had gotten her second dose 3 days before and had a low grade fever, body aches, chills and didn&#39;t feel well for 24 to 48 hours. She started not feeling well and started getting chills. She was shaking really bad at 1:00 in the morning. She really didn&#39;t feel good. She took her temperature and it was 100.5. Her hands were freezing and her finger nails were purple. Her hands were cold and she was getting a fever. She guesses that can happen. Lasted a little longer from 1:00 until about 3:30 in the morning. Caller was up with her the entire night. Her fever went up to 103.2. Her heart was beating really fast. Caller was getting really scared and was thinking about taking her to the emergency room. She thought this was really weird. She gave her Tylenol trying to hold off. She was trying not to give her too much because there are dozens of interactions. She needed to give her something. Within an hour, it brought her fever down about 2 degrees and was then around 101.5. Her heart rate was still pretty fast. Was still a bit concerned but was glad her fever went down. Other than that, she seemed fine. Her daughter was drinking a lot of water to keep hydrated and was peeing a lot because she was drinking so much water. She seemed okay after that but her heart was still beating faster. Her daughter got up, she didn&#39;t sleep very much, and got up around 8:00 am, about 4 hours after taking the Tylenol. She didn&#39;t have a high fever but it was still around 101. She gave her more Tylenol and her heart was still beating fast. Reporter did not time it to see how fast it was. She could just tell that it was beating fast, like she was doing aerobics or something. Her daughter got the shot in her right arm. It really felt lumpy under her arm pit. Caller had read that some people get that, their lymph nodes get inflamed. Consumer only gave those 2 doses of Tylenol, her daughters fever got better. Her heart rate went back to normal and she seems fine now. She said her lymph nodes under her right arm seem like they are feeling better- before, she couldn&#39;t even put her arm down because they hurt so bad. She does seem to have improved; This was last Thursday and this is Tuesday. She did call the doctors office and talked to the nurse who said she hadn&#39;t heard of a fever that high. Said that sometimes when people get a fever, their heart rate can increase and that it is not unheard of. She didn&#39;t think that she had to be seen because she was improving. It bothered her the next few days. She heard on TV that kids were getting heart inflammation. Heart beating really fast: Reporter felt her wrist and felt her heart beating really fast. Lasted a little longer, until about 3:30 in the morning. Her daughters heart was beating so fast, it felt as if she were exercising but, she was sitting still. Her daughter seems fine now and caller has been checking her every day. Arm sore and lumpy under arm pit: This happened the next morning, Friday. Her daughter felt like she couldn&#39;t move and wanted to take a shower. She felt so sweaty and she couldn&#39;t touch her arm pit because it hurt so much. Reporter had read that some peoples lymph nodes get inflamed. It seemed better as the day went on. Treatment: Had  only 2 doses of Tylenol. Her daughter doesn&#39;t swallow pills, so she had given her Children&#39;s strength Tylenol that is for children ages 2-11. She had only given her 15ml, which for her wasn&#39;t a lot. It says it&#39;s for up to 80 pound kids. Gave her 15ml at 04:00 am and it did bring it down 2 degrees. She gave her the same dose at 8:00 am. It wasn&#39;t even an adult strength dose. Fever: Her daughter&#39;s fever went away. She went back to bed, she had only slept from 05:00 am to possibly 08:00am, and didn&#39;t even sleep well then.

It lasted until about 06/14/2021 and then I noticed the lymph node protrusion on Sunday and I went to the urgent care  Clinic on Monday  06/14/2021and they just said it would go away. At the Doctor they did blood pressure test and an EKG and they did EKG because I had vasovagal response after touching lymph node. There was a few nights in a row about a week after the vaccine, where I had insomnia and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep at all and had to take sleep aid. Lymph node swelling did go down and isn&#39;t inflamed anymore.

This continued until about 7/6, at the beginning of the day my arm was lightly sore, while my leg was still averagely sore. As I used and walked on my leg, by the end of the day, my leg was very sore, sorer than in the morning. The pain felt like a shot down the side of my leg. The worst pain was in my ankle and foot area. As each day passes, the sore pain seems to be getting worse. I contacted my doctor and talked to her yesterday (7/12) and she recommended some medicine that may help but advised that I report the events to you.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                I got the shot around 5:20. About 4 hours later I started to feel nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. About an hour after that I had diarrhea. I went to bed, couldn?t fall asleep until 3. I woke up at 6 am sweating a lot and having body aches that were very persistent and painful in my legs. This persisted to 3/12/2021 until about 6 or 7 pm and I began to feel a lot better. That entire day I was hot and cold and had body aches. But no longer had vomiting. Then on Saturday, 3/13/2021 I woke up with a sore left armpit and neck but the armpit was way worse. I looked it up ?sore left armpit after covid vaccine? and it said swollen lymph nodes - so I?m guessing that?s what both pains were as my roommate who had the second dosage of Pfizer vaccine  the week before had a protruding lymph node on her neck. They both are still in pain until today 3/15/2021.

Around 2:00 on 3/11/2021, patient felt a chill, her temperature was 100.4 F orally. Temperature further increased to 103 F around 13:00 on 3/12/2021.   What happened as a result of the adverse event? (doctor visit, ED or urgent care visit, hospitalization, life threatening illness, disability/permanent damage, death, none of these): none of these, took OTC apap last night and this morning and just took ibuprofen after the 103 F reading.  Spoke with patient&#39;s mother, who stated that the is feeling fine. The patient&#39;s temperature is currently 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and initially came back to normal at 02:00 today (3/13/21). The patient experienced elevated temperatures before that time (02:00), of note was at 22:00 on 3/12/21, at which time the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. A later temperature after 22:00 on 3/12/21, and before 02:00 on 3/13/21, was recorded, which was 101 degrees Fahrenheit.   The patient&#39;s mother stated that the daughter may have COVID based upon speaking with her doctor, so she inquired if her daughter should be tested for the presence of antibodies against COVID-19. Patient&#39;s mother also inquired if there was a need for the second shot if it was seen that her daughter had antibodies against the virus.  Advised the mother that her questions would be looked into for answers, and that she would be called back with those answers.

But after one week felt good again.

These symptoms included severe nausea, headache, weak/rapid heart rate, chills, muscle aches, and a fever of 101 degrees F.  Lymph nodes in the left armpit were also swollen and painful to the touch. After 10am, the chills and fever subsided, but the headache, general muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and bouts of nausea persisted (these lasted the entire day). The following day (4/23),  nausea and muscle aches subsided but the headache remained. The headache only came on whenever changing elevation of the head (standing up, sitting down, bending over), at which point it would be painful for a few minutes after moving. An extremely stiff, painful neck also began the same day (4/23) and persisted for approximately 2 days after injection (accompanied by the headache). Lymph nodes under the collar bone on the left side of the body also became swollen (4/23). Lymph nodes in armpit and under collarbone are still swollen 6 days after injection, although not painful.

                                                I had received mosquito bites on my leg a week before I received the first dose of the COVID vaccine. These bug bites were not itching and almost gone when I received the vaccine, however, the night after my vaccine they became very itchy. The next morning, the bites had swelled up, were very hot, itchy and unbearable to manage. They were treated with at home-remedies and over the counter itch medicine. They are almost gone again as of the 27th of April. I took various pictures when they swelled up. My partner received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and also said his bug bites became itchy for the first time since he got the bite.

                                                A bubble/bump in collar bone area (near middle of the collar bone) formed underneath the skin on the ipsilateral side two days after second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The bubble was able to move from below the collarbone to above, and vice versa, with manual manipulation and with regular movement of the upper body. I suspect that it was an inflamed supraclavicular lymph node. It hurt to touch and move. I did not see a healthcare provider for treatment. It gradually reduced in size and it took 11 days to disappear.

This consumer reported different events for two patients. This is 1 of 2 reports. A 21-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s ((Name)colleague&#39;s daughter) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 04May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0171) (at the age of 21-year-old) as 2nd dose, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy with garlic. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 on an unspecified date for covid-19 immunization. The reporter stated that on 04May2021 the patient got vaccinated with the second dose of vaccine and two days later i.e., on 06May2021 she had some hives, but she never had it before, and she developed an allergic reaction and was in an emergency room having anaphylactic shock and was hospitalized for 3 time and treated with Epinephrine (treatment). She went to an allergist and they checked, they said she did not have any allergy. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                The vaccination went as expected the day after with fever and chills. But the second day after the vaccine I woke up with welts on my arms and legs the grew until they encompassed my legs fully and inner arms full. It spread to my entire body in big parts. The third day is spread to everywhere it hadnt the first (chest, stomach, outer arms, feet and hands). But it swelled my hands to the point that I can&#39;t make a fist. The fourth day the welts and rash cleared up everywhere else but I woke up with it on my feet and they swelled to the point where I can&#39;t walk today. So day 3 it swelled my hands and day 4 is swelled my feet but its going away within a 24 hrs period. I am currently unable to use pens and small objects in my hands to hold due to the swelling. I am also unable to walk. The ER says to wait it out because its an allergic reaction and I intend to. But even the pharmacy said that out of their 9000 patients done i have been the only one thst has had a worse adverse effect on the second dose. Nothing occurred on the first dose, just the second. I hsvebeen taking benadryl and tylonol but they don&#39;t seem to do much ut just is taking time, but there has been no improvement on my hands or feet.

                                                pneumothorax, her right lung collapsed; cyst that was ready to burst on her lung; swelling in her right arm under the arm and in her chest area and breast; swelling in her right arm under the arm and in her chest area and breast; a heart murmur; a high resting heart rate; Back pain; lymph node swelling under her right arm pit into her chest; swelling in her lymph nodes and in her chest that were painful; swelling in her right arm under the arm and in her chest area and breast; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 21-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 09Apr2021 (lot number EW0153), at the age of 21 years, as the first single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included an unspecfied low estrogen birth control (she just took a birth control pill every day, probably on it since she was 16 or 17 years old). On 12Apr2021 the patient experienced back pain. On an unspecified date in 2021 the patient experienced lymph node swelling under her right arm pit into her chest. She had swelling in her lymph nodes and in her chest that were painful and she could touch them. On 16Apr2021 the patient experienced pneumothorax (on that day she went to the urgent care and they told her that her lung was about to collapse). The reporter finally got her daughter to come home from school and she took her to the emergency room on 17Apr2021. When the lung had collapsed, she felt worse and then she was in the hospital for an entire week. This event required hospitalization from 17Apr2021 to 29Apr2021. On 23Apr2021 she had a tube in her chest that was drawing the air out and they did something where they inflated her lung to see if it would stay and it wouldn&#39;t stay so they had to do surgery on 26Apr2021. When they went to do surgery they saw that on the outer part of her lung where the hole was that it wouldn&#39;t heal and they saw that it was like a cobble stone texture on the outside of the lung. The patient was in the hospital until 29Apr2021 and she was in the ICU the entire time. She went for check-ups and everything seemed to be good and her lung had healed. The caller was trying to connect dots between her family members and she had asked her daughter how she felt right after the COVID vaccine and her daughter said that she felt like &#34;ehhh&#34; and then on 12Apr2021 she had the back pain, then on 13Apr2021 she had air bubbles in her chest and on 15Apr2021 she was trying to walk to bars and she was out of breath. On 16Apr2021 the urgent care said they saw a cyst that was ready to burst on her lung and she was on bed rest and was given steroids. The caller thought that the swelling and the lymph nodes and having the cobble stone texture were all from irritation and then it had made a blister that popped creating the hole. On 29Jun2021 the patient experienced heart murmur and a high resting heart rate. Around 29Jun2021, the patient was feeling like her heart was moving in her chest and that it was out of synch and not right and that it was racing high and so the reporter called their family doctor who saw the patient the next day. They did an EKG that was irregular and now she had a heart murmur. She wasn&#39;t born with that and she had never had that and she didn&#39;t leave the hospital with that. She was fine until now with her having the murmur and the high resting heart rate, around 85. The caller didn&#39;t know the exact EKG irregularities because it said &#34;normal&#34; but they gave a copy to her and said to bring it to the cardiologist because it was not normal. The reporter didn&#39;t know the details and won&#39;t until the follow-up appointment on 16Jul2021 which was when they would have a better idea about what they were going to call this. She had the swelling in her right arm under the arm and in her chest area and breast, she was thin breasted, this was on the right side and then her right lung collapsed. The caller says that this was not a coincidence. There was no way that she would have three family members injured if it wasn&#39;t for the COVID vaccine. Her daughter should be taking an allergy medication but she won&#39;t take it. The patient did not receive the 2nd dose (when she had gotten out of the hospital after her pneumothorax that was when she was supposed to get her 2nd dose but they didn&#39;t go get it because they couldn&#39;t risk that). Back pain resolved on an unspecified date in 2021. The other events outcome was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed.

                                                I experienced severe arm pain for a couple of days after receiving both doses. I also experienced tingles through my right arm and right breast. At first I was feeling the tingling all over, but it&#39;s not consistent. Just yesterday, the tingling felt like rain drops hitting my skin. I have swollen lymph nodes and I am currently sick. I have been sick twice now and I hardly ever get sick. I did wake up, after a nap, the night after receiving the second dose, feeling cold and later on, I had a fever. It was 80 degrees in my house. I started to experience some chest pain. I was vaping and I stopped. The pain went away after about 3-4 days. I had to take shallow breaths for those 3-4 days because of the sharp pain I would feel. I feel skeptical that my immune system has been weakened.

Eyes felt swollen a few hours after receiving vaccine between 1-2 pm. Symptoms went away. At around 11pm I got welts and hives all over my body but they were particularly prevalent at the vaccine site. No change in routine throughout the day nor a change in food. Largely went away by the next day around 1pm. Still experiencing slight itchiness.

                                                The day after the vaccination I started getting a sore right TMJ. I waited a week to see if it would go away, but it didn&#39;t. I then took aleve and ibuprofen for about two days which decreased the TMJ pain and it did not return. It was then that I noticed that I had a tender swollen lymph node under the right side of my chin. I assume that the swollen lymph node was the cause of the TMJ pain.

On Tuesday morning at 2:30 AM, I began to have a fever and developed a mild full body rash. This severely escalated and by Wednesday, I developed full body hives and uncontrollable fevers as high as 105. Since then, I have been anti-histamines and steroids, which made my rash worse but helped the fever and lymph nodes. My hives are painful, itchy, and getting worse.

                                                I first noticed a pain in my left armpit on Sunday 04/04/2021, but I just thought I pulled a muscle or something. Then on Monday, it wasn&#39;t any better, and when I looked in the mirror I realized my lymph node was very swollen and tender. This brings me to today where the lymph node in my left armpit is still swollen. I talked to a nurse to be safe, and she told me it should go away within a week-10 days, so I&#39;m not too concerned.

                                                Although I did experience extreme headaches and a sore arm within days of getting the vaccine in addition to continuing &amp; excessive fatigue, a little over a week later I had an extreme, painful skin outbreak all over my body. I&#39;m assuming my eczema flared up in reaction to the vaccine, but up until that day my eczema had been dormant and restricted to a mild dry patch on my arm and leg joints. Within an hour, I had red spots and red patches appear all over body, including my stomach and back, where I hadn&#39;t had an eczema outbreak in years. My neck was swollen and became extremely wrinkly in appearance, as did my elbows and anywhere else I itched. Although that night was the most abrupt and extreme part of the reaction period, it took 3 days for the flare-up to calm down, the duration of which I was incredibly itchy and experiencing some pain. I took several Benadryl tablets the next day to help calm the itchiness before bedtime.

                                                March 5, 2021: 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine. Severe site pain.  March 23, 2021: 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine. Felt very restless and sick during night, by the next morning symptoms really sat in.  March 24, 2021: Went to Urgent Care due to fever. Had COVID-19 test (negative). Very close to passing out there (put head between knees and did not). Was sent to emergency room immediately due to heart rate (high 140s-150s. Highest known was 152 BPM). ER performed following: portable chest x-ray, blood tests, urine tests, EKG. Was told results were all normal with the exception of EKG (not told anything about it, form listed as abnormal). Passed out 2x at hospital. Was given one IV rehydration solution and released that night. Symptoms below lasted for several days: Headache Aches Nausea Aggressive shakes Shortness of breath Confusion Dizziness Site pain (also developed bump under arm) Fever - 103.8 (after 2 Advil, 2 Tylenol, 3 ice packs and eating frozen grapes) Heavy sweats Racing heart Restless  March 30, 2021: Still having frequent heart palpitations (they come and go but happen several times during the day. Keep having very high heart rates). Went to doctor. While there, nurse noted irregular heartbeat that sounded like it was ?skipping a beat? and heart rate was also jumping all over the place (high pace, low pace, high, etc.). It was clear something was abnormal. Doctor gave EKG approximately 20 minutes later, EKG looked normal. Was told to come back next morning for blood work and to cut out caffeine.  March 31, 2021: Came in for blood work to check thyroid.  April 6, 2021: Thyroid results were normal. Still having palpitations among other symptoms (see April 12 for more info) so was told to come in. Was given ?work from home? note and referred to cardiologist.  April 12, 2021: Appointment at cardiologist. Still having severe palpitations, occasional dizziness/ lightheadedness, nausea, shortness of breath, exhaustion and chest pain. Heart rate was recorded this day to have gotten up to 139 BPM-- was very high majority of the day. EKG was normal (with exception of high heart rate) but 30 mins later doctor observed high heart rate and abnormal rhythm. Was told to come back in a week and one day for a heart ultrasound and heart monitoring for three days. Still no caffeine intake since 3/30/21. Previous heart rates taken at doctor&#39;s visits over the years for comparison below. Never had any prior heart problems whatsoever:  8/29/18: 70 BPM 9/17/18: 88 BPM 10/17/18: 64 BPM 10/31/18: 73 BPM 1/21/19: 78 BPM Note: At this point, I have missed over a  week and a half of work, and worked from home for over a week. I&#39;m not any better heart wise at all over the course of three weeks post vaccine.

I woke up again around 5:15 am to intense involuntary shaking. My family members wrapped me in blankets and applied pressure to my body until the shaking stopped. Within the next 40 minutes I vomited and had diarrhea. At the time also had body aches, chills, fever, and mild swelling of various areas if the body. I slept most of the morning and ate lunch around 1:30 pm. I took Tylenol again at 2:00 pm with the symptoms lessening over the next 5-6 hours. After that fever, chills, and body aches returned.

                                                Around 3:30am on Sunday, I woke up due to feeling very cold. My teeth were chattering and regardless of the amount of layers of clothes or blankets added, I could not get warm. Later in the day I checked my temperature and it registered at 100.6 degree Fahrenheit, but I did not feel as cold as I had earlier that morning. I also had what felt like a sinus headache and my whole body felt stiff/achy. There was also some slight nausea that occurred. The nausea and slight fever went away by 11am, but the headache and body aches lasted until about 9PM Sunday night. After my nausea went away I was able to take some Aleve to help with the stiffness.  At the site of injection, it is slightly raised red bump (about two inches across horizontally and vertically), and there is some slight pain  in the armpit area on this side as well. The swelling of the bump was slightly bigger yesterday, but the swelling has gone down some this morning.

She had a doctors visit on 04/15/2021, no prescription but she has been taking advil 200 2 tabs, 2x daily every 8 hrs. RN recommendation. She is no longer having any swelling or pain. She asked if she should receive the second dose, RN states yes. Her adverse reaction was mild with no respiratory issues. The benefits of her second dose outweighs the possible adverse reaction. Patient is agreeable.

                                                On April 5th, 2021 I went to the E.D. , for shortness of breath and severe right shoulder pain. While there they got a chest x-ray, ran labs, and did a chest CT. The CT revealed that I had one blood clot in my left lung and two blood clots in my right lung, as well as slight pleural effusion in the right lower lobe. They put me on Xarelto for the next 3-6 months and monthly follow up visits with my primary care provider. I was also given Hydrocodone as need. I experienced extreme pain with breathing and sort of movement for a week and half but currently only have occasional shoulder and back pain usually at the end of the day.

                                                14 days after first shot, Pt had stinging/burning pain in her right big toe at bedtime. She thought she hurt her toe working out. As days went on, pain got so bad she went to urgent care for an x-ray. They found nothing wrong. The foot started to swell. Went to the school to see dr there. They said not broken just irritated the sesamoids under her big toe. 4-6 weeks to heal in a soft boot. The on April 16th she got her second shot.  As she sat there waiting her 15 mins, she said her right foot went numb. We then went home. That night we iced her bad right foot and I noticed both feet were purple!! I looked up reactions to shots and it actually said it is a side effect. I called my doctor and he said the fact that the toes turn purple and then back to normal was ok. 9 days after the second shot she said the same pain started in her left foot. She can&#39;t walk on either foot!!! It is neuropathy from the shots!!! My doctor is scheduling tests for her.

I had a lot of bumps on my forearm that were itchy and turning red as a result of my itching. My left hand had no bumps but it was completely swollen. My face began to swell at my upper cheeks and around my jaw. The right side of my upper lip swelled up prior to the rest of my face and remained that way. It became difficult to keep my eyes open. This facial swelling lasted for three days and on the third day, my neck began to swell right along with my submandibular lymph nodes. This neck and facial swelling went down on May 2nd after I was advised by a sports medicine staff member to take ibuprofen.

A 22-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8731) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, premature ovarian failure and covid-19. Concomitant medications were not reported. After the second shot the patient received in Apr2021, she was sitting for the 15 minutes after the vaccine and her right foot was numb and tingling. Her left foot was fine. At home after the vaccine the patient had her feet propped up and her toes were purple.  They did not think about it being any type of side effect from the Covid Vaccine; they thought maybe her foot was wrapped too tightly. On Monday, 26Apr2021, her big toe on her left foot now has the same stinging, burning, pain that the right toe had in it when this all began. Her toes on both feet are still turning purple off and on.  The doctor says that since when they are pressed the purple goes away then comes back it is okay. Both feet were swollen at one time.  The swelling has decreased in the right foot; but continues in the left. It was believed that the patient was suffering from neuropathy. The patient was recovering from the event peripheral swelling. The outcome of the events was pain in extremity and skin coloring was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 22-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 04May2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269), as dose 1, single, at age 22 years old, for COVID-19 immunization, at a pharmacy/drug store. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Raynaud&#39;s disease, all from unknown dates, not reported if ongoing or not. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient received unspecified medications within 2 weeks of vaccination (unspecified concomitant medications). On 07May2021 (also reported as &#34;around day 3 or day 4&#34;), the patient started to get dizzy. On the same day, 07May2021, the patient felt like have a stroke because she could not make thoughts. She had pitting in left leg (also reported as &#34;pitting in left left&#34;, pending clarification), which was pale and had veins showing, and she was struggling to breathe and was weak. On 09May2021 (also reported as &#34;about day 5&#34;), her heart rate was very low and she noticed circulation issues. On 11May2021 (also reported as &#34;day 7&#34;), her legs swelled up so bad. On 14May2021 (also reported as &#34;day 10&#34;), the patient&#39;s thyroid or throat area was pounding. The events resulted to emergency room and physician&#39;s office visits. Treatment for the events included turmeric and aspirin which the patient took every day, multiple times a day. Blood work on an unspecified date mostly came back normal. The patient reported the events were better in two weeks. Her physician advised her to skip the second dose. However, the patient received the second dose out of &#34;fear of missing out&#34; on 25May2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0178) in the left arm. The patient was recovering from the events.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height. AE Details and time of onset: Sore Throat 12:00 on 29 Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling 20:00 Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102: 21:00 Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes- 21:00 Migraine- 21:00 Frequent Urination 23:00 Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids 23:00 Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in: 21:00. ER or physician&#39;s office required: Went to urgent care 36 hours after administration. No treatment given. She just wanted to make sure no additional infection was causing anything weird.

Treated with ibuprofen. 21 hours post vaccination was the peak of the symptoms, temperature of 101.6 with ibuprofen, strong body aches, weakness, and anorexia. Symptoms became more mild at hour 31 post vaccine. I had a swollen lymph node after the first vaccine above my left collarbone (injected on left side) and still have this, and now I have a swollen armpit that is very painful on my right side (injected on the right side).

The following day 1/08/21 I still had a sore throat I was able to eat , but at the end of the night I got a fever me temperature was 102.0 . I knew all these symptoms were normal but being that on 1/09/21 It was painful for me to swallow I went to immediate care where they said I still had a fever and told me I had a swollen tonsil on the left side of the mouth which is also the side I received the vaccine on. I still continued to have a fever . Saturday night I noticed I had gotten some small sores on my mouth also on the left side . On Sunday I had loose stool , but I have been eating very soft foods because of my throat . Which then I went to go see a dentist and she said they appeared to be fever blisters , those popped I have a couple on my tongue as well . As of today my throat pain feels to be getting better .I did start a oral mouth rinse also for the sores

                                                Rash consisting of hives or small red bumps suddenly appeared on upper body (arms, chest, upper back) the morning of 12/26/20. Rash continued to spread to lower back and stomach over the next few days with the left arm being the most affected area. Facial redness and swelling occurred however breathing was never affected.  Benadryl did not provide much relief. Visited an urgent care which classified it as an allergic reaction and started 5 day course of prednisone on 12/28/2020. Symptoms resolved upon completion of the prednisone. Total duration of symptoms was approximately one week. I had not used any new skin products or eaten any foods new to my diet and nothing else comes to mind as a potential contributing factor.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

There was no treatment given for the events.

                                                First 2 days after vaccination, I had some injection site pain that was improving. Day 5 after vaccination, I developed lymphadenopathy on my left side with swelling into the chest area developing on day 6. Day 8 after vaccination, my injection site turned red and itchy and I began to have trouble breathing. I went to urgent care.  I saw P. A. She said that it was more likely that the difficulty breathing would be due to my asthma, but she could not recommend whether or not I should receive my second dose. She proscribed 20mg of Prednisone and refilled my albuterol prescription. About 20 hours later, my breathing is still difficult and my arm still itches.  We also discussed that the respiratory symptoms could be caused or exasperated by COVID-19, so I am waiting on results from a covid test.

However, on the 28th of January, I woke up with supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on my left side of my neck. So, I have swelling and lumps/growths above my left collar bone. My left arm is numb and tingly and I feel very sick. I am nauseous and have body aches. I went to urgent care and they believe it is a reaction to the vaccine. I was tested for mono and strep throat and do not have either. I took a rapid covid test on Wednesday the 27th and it was negative.

Patient reported that on 18Jan2021, on the right side of her face under her jaw she noticed her lymph node was swollen and she described it as &#34;not terrible just a constant pain.&#34; She would like to know if this was a common side effect, and if how long should she wait before she could contact her doctor about this side effect. These were the only symptoms she experienced. The swelling has stayed the same. She did not know if the swollen lymph node could be from the COVID vaccine or not. Patient stated if the swollen lymph node was not a part of the symptoms for the COVID vaccine, she definitely needs to go see a doctor. The events were considered as non-serious by the reporter. The events did not require a visit to emergency room nor the physician office. The outcome of swollen lymph node and lymph node pain was not recovered; while pain and swelling at injection site recovered on 14Jan2021.

                                                About 1.5-2 hours post immunization the patient returned having developed a headache and a quarter sized welt that was lightly red, swollen and very tender to touch, just below her left collar bone about 4 inches from the injection site. The welt was outlined and observed and the patient was given 25mg of Benadryl. After about 20 minutes the swelling and tenderness had spread to an area approximately the diameter of a tennis ball. At this point she was refered to see a doctor at the Health Center. The nurse called to follow-up once the patient arrived as she had not seen this type of reaction after the vaccine. After discussion the physician was going to look at her. Reportedly the swelling had begun to retract and the patient apparently returned to work later that day, talking about her plans to receive the second dose.

                                                29 minutes after being given the vaccine my tongue started itching and swelled up a bit, my mouth felt dry, my face became a bit reddened, puffy, and itchy, my throat began to swell a bit and my chest felt tight, giving me some discomfort when it came to breathing. I let the nurses who were keeping an eye on those waiting for 15/30 minutes know that I was having a reaction. I waited 1 more minute, and when my throat felt tighter and I had a bit more difficulty breathing, I took 1 Benadryl tablet, and waited 2 minutes, and when the symptoms were still worsening slowly, I took a second Benadryl tablet and after a few minutes my symptoms started to go away.  I waited another 10 minutes and then went home when it seemed that my symptoms were going away.  At 6:45pm on 2/21/2021 my throat and chest started feeling tight again and gave me mild breathing discomfort, so I took another Benadryl tablet, a few minutes later my face began to itchy and my mouth felt dry and my tongue felt a bit swollen, whereupon I took a second Benadryl tablet at 6:56pm, and then felt a wave of nausea.  At 6:59pm, the feeling of tightness had not abated, but also hadn&#39;t worsened noticeably, and the itching feeling began to spread from my face to my ears and down my neck.  At 7:04pm the tightness of my throat and chest began to increase some, and I started to feel some anxiety.  At 7:11pm I inhaled two puffs from an albuterol inhaler used for treating asthma as my throat and chest were continuing to slowly get tighter.  At 7:26pm I still felt itchy and my throat and chest still felt tight, but it wasn&#39;t noticeably worse.  At 7:35pm, my throat began to feel tight enough to give me noticeable discomfort while breathing and for me to make a slight wheezing sound while breathing, and my tongue felt like it swelled a bit more, and my mouth still felt dry.  At 7:51pm the Benadryl made me feel sleepy, but had no effect on my itchy skin or tightness of throat or chest.  8:00pm, my throat and chest felt tighter and I started having some difficulty swallowing and I felt very warm.  8:05pm, I had a lot of difficulty swallowing and had trouble breathing, so I went to the Emergency Room and was given an Epinephrine shot and sent home after an hour of observation.

A 23-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 02Mar2021, 16:15, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, covid back in Dec2020, known allergies to flu vaccine and TB test and seizure (have history). Concomitant medications included levetiracetam (KEPPRA), lamotrigine (LAMICTAL), cenobamate (XCOPRI) and magnesium. The patient had no other vaccine in 4 weeks. On 02Mar2021 16:15, the patient experienced arm swelling, pain, itching, couldn&#39;t feel lower legs, extreme chest pains and chills. On 02Mar2021, at 17:15, the patient experienced headache an hour later. On 03Mar2021 01:00, the patient experienced seizure at the middle of the night around 01:00. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had Covid prior vaccination; and was not Covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of event seizure was not recovered; outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient had underlying epilepsy. However, based on the close temporal association, a possible contributory role of bnt162b2 to the development of seizure cannot be excluded.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I got my vaccine on 3/19 at 10am. My 6:30 pm on 3/19 my face got dark red, almost purple and started to swell. I went to and urgent care where they gave me a 50 mg shot of Benadryl. AFter about 20 minutes the reaction was getting better so they released me to go home. They told me to continue taking the Benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 2-3 days. I did as directed for through the night and the next day. Around 6:30 pm on 3/20 I started feeling very tired, shaky, and dazed. My about 9:00 that evening I began to feel swelling in  my throat/tongue. I then went to the emergency room and where they gave me another 50 mg shot of Benadryl and a 6 mg shot of Decadron. They monitored me for a couple hours and the swelling in my mouth had gone down and the rash that had also reappeared had gone down. They sent me home with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg 4 pills a day for 4 days and told me to continue the Benadryl. I took the Prednisone and Benadryl for all day 3/21 and was feeling better. When I woke up on 3/22, my chest and arms had a rash on them. I took a Benadryl around 7:30 and Prednisone around 8:30. I went to work and around 10:30 my face started getting red and swelling again. I contacted my dermatologist who did skin patch testing and got an appoint for 3/22 at 1:45. She extended the Prednisone out to 12 days and told me to switch to Zytrec during the day and I will follow up on three weeks.

When I arrived patient was laying down on a chair with a friend, shaking with seizure like activity but alert and oriented to person place and time. Upon my arrival she was shaking, vomited x 1 and then complained about chest pain.   Vitals upon my arrival: HR 58, o2 100% RR appeared to be around 22-24 (hyperventilating) BP 88 systolic (manual)--repeated by medics upon arrival minutes later 110/72.   Given throat closing sensation, vomiting, shortness of breath I advised to call 911 and ordered Epinephrine x 1 which was given by RN immediately. Pt was then placed on the grown chin up, she continued to shake throughout entire body but continued to be alert and oriented. Medics then arrived on seen, started an IV, glucose by medics 84, IVF started by medics. Pt was transported to ER via medics.   Pt is not a patient, last visit 2017. Pt did state she has hx of POTS and DRESS syndrome to Lamictal. Reports taking cetirizine this AM, Zofran and Oxycodone and Baclofen (prescribed by external PCP?).   Prior to transport to ER pt continued to be alert oriented, but shaking and twitching throughout her body. MD verbally communicated to patient to not receive the 2nd dose given her severe anaphylaxis like reaction to the first dose of the vaccine. Pt can be referred to allergist after ER follow up by PCP.  Denied pregnancy.

I just got my second vaccine today, on my right arm so I can track the left side and see if this really does correlate with the vaccine.

                                                Arm was super sore and felt swollen. Felt numb at times. Slurred words 30 min after shot. Fatigued and exhausted causing me to sleep for hours. Felt like a hangover without the drinking. Another comparison is that it felt like the last day of being sick with the flu, just very groggy and not feeling 100 percent okay.

Received 2nd covid vaccination last week- mild reaction with fever thereafter.  She had w/u in the ED including an EKG with inferior and septal TWI and trop of 1.61.  CTA chest was negative.  She was admitted.  After admit, troponin trended up (1.61--3.71--4.93).  CRP 49.1, ESR 21.   Echo showed apex hypokinesis so with TWI on EKG and elevated trop, cardiology elected for LHC.  This was normal.  Cardiac MRI showed myopericarditis. She was started on high dose ASA, colchicine and bblocker for this.  Likely viral etiology (Covid, Resp 4 plex negative).  Trop trended down on 4/13 (CRP still rising).  Cardiology was ok with discharge.  Will need 2 weeks of ASA and 3 months of colchicine.  No strenuous activities for that time frame.  She is getting her Masters in music/violin and did not need a return to school note.   Feeling somewhat better at discharge- rated pain 6/10.    Internal Medicine followup in 1 week Cardiology followup in 2 months

                                                I (patient) developed swollen and painful lymph nodes in the underarms on both sides of my body. They began on the side of the injection but spread to include both arms. In addition, two similarly swollen and painful lumps have appeared, though I am not sure if they are lymph nodes given their locations. One is along my the line of my waistband in the front of my body, not in the traditional groin area where most charts ascribe lymph nodes to be. One is directly below my areola on my right breast. Along with these lumps, I developed a rash made up of several small, inflamed hives that range from painless, to itchy, to painful. They are concentrated along my bra line, particularly around my breasts, but are spread everywhere from below my neckline to above my ankles. These symptoms began approximately 7 days after my second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and are continuing at the time of this report.

                                                At about the same time the standard soreness at the shot site from the shot began to form (in the left arm), soreness also began to form in the left armpit.  Both signs of soreness began around 7pm the evening of the shot. The day after the shot was administered the soreness in the shot site began to lessen but the pain in the armpit persisted. The armpit pain, the day after the shot was administered, felt sore, almost as if I have been holding a golf ball tightly between my arm and torso for hours and a bruise had formed.  That night I checked my armpit to see if there was any swelling or bruising. There was some swelling and a small lump within the tissue of the armpit the night of the day after the shot. The morning of the 23rd , two days after the shot was administered, the armpit pain persisted and the lump was bigger than the night before and the swelling remained.

I experienced heavy allergy symptoms including redness and swelling in left eye, watery eyes particularly in left eye, runny nose and pain particularly in left nostril, heaviness of breath, tiredness.  I think it is of note that as of writing this, I have not received commonly reported symptoms of fever, chills and nausea in conjunction with the reported adverse symptoms.

                                                The day following the vaccination I woke up with severe arm pain 2 inches down from the injection site. My arm had swollen about 3 inches in diameter. It was so painful that I could not roll over, I could not lift my arm, and I was in inconsolable tears. It was a deep stinging pain, as though I was repeatedly being stung by a hornet. My left hand was going numb off and on. I went to the doctor because I was incapable of lifting my arm, and the doctor identified that my lymph nodes and my left ear were swollen and enlarged. He recommended ibuprofen and ice for the lump. The second day after receiving the vaccine I had a mild headache, and my arm was only slightly swollen. The third day after receiving the vaccine my arm was still slightly swollen and sore, but the pain was manageable without pain medication. The fourth day after receiving the vaccine I woke up with a deep cough and dizzy spells lasting throughout the day.

Around 16:35, when I woke up, I noticed a rash and that my body was feeling swollen. I took 2 Benadryl gel pills at 18:03. I felt some difficulty breathing, and itching sensation all over my body and still had a lot of tension on the left side of my jaw.  I went out to eat with my boyfriend, because we had plans and he had also complained of having some cold chills from the vaccine, and he noticed that I had red marks on my hands.  By May 7 10:05 I called off of work to go my doctor, because I had massive splotches of raised itchy hives all over my body.  It was confirmed that I was having an allergic reaction and I received a steroid shot in my upper gluteal muscle, as well as Famotidine 20mg twice daily for 5 days and Prednisone 20mg twice daily for 5 days.

My arm was sore and I also knew that was expected. I could hardly move out of bed. At 0700 this morning, on 6/4, I finally got the energy to shower. That is when I noticed my lymph node in my armpit of the same arm I received my vaccine in was swollen to about the size of a tennis ball. I had a PA that I work with recommend me to go to an urgent care to be seen because she did not believe this to be normal. I received a Toradol injection and a course of antibiotics to take in case it turned out to be infected.

It felt bruised and I felt something that felt like a ball rolling around. I called advice from clinic and they scheduled me a visit with Dr. for a video visit. At my visit with him, I explained what it was and I mentioned that I heard about lymph node enlargement after the vaccine. He told me that he hadn&#39;t heard anything about that, but scheduled an ultrasound for me. I scheduled an appt with my PCP and she told me that she did hear about the lymph node enlargement from the vaccine. I had the ultrasound on 03/30 and the results came back benign. Dr. called with my results and requested a follow up in 3 months.

Covid 2nd vaccine 2 days ago in L arm.  PE: afeb/nontoxic, remarkable for 2x2 cm, tender, rubbery, mobile, nonfluctuant lymph node medial aspect of L axilla c/w local reaction to covid vaccination.  Symptoms most consistent with known side-effect of COVID-19 vaccine of ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, and is likely self-limited. Systemic infection is also possible, though less likely given time course. Unlikely recurrence of lymphoma with absence of B symptoms.   Recommended Tylenol for pain. Provided reassurance and recommended following up with PCP if persists longer than 1 week.

                                                Within the first day, my hands felt swollen and would not stop tingling. I had awful chest pain and neck numbness 24 hours after the vaccine. Two days after the vaccine, I felt fatigued, had a very rapid heart beat (130 bpm while sitting), and had hypertension (BP: 182/92). I had to go to the emergency room twice due to high blood pressure and a very rapid heart beat (both visits were on the Staurday two days after my vaccine). For 9 whole days after the vaccine, I felt fatigued, no appetite, I was not able to sleep, and I felt lots of chest paint.

A 23-year-old female patient (daughter) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: ER8737 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 07Apr2021 at 11:00 AM (age at vaccination: 23 year) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included anemic, eczema, gastric reflex, known allergies: citrus food, latex gloves, Compazine, Augment, and headaches from concussions. Concomitant medications included Ferrous Sulfate, Diethylpropion HCL, and glucose, sodium chloride (DNS). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. There was a product complaint to report.   On 07Apr2021 12:30, the patient experienced swollen neck/neck was swelling, nauseated vomiting/nausea and vomiting, entire body swelling all extremities, itchy red rash: face, neck, upper chest, forearms, thighs, back eyebrows, severe frontal occipital lateral stabbing headache, sore, tender body and chills. On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced right upper shoulder discomfort with swelling that goes into her neck, light sensitivity, having a rash, rash is itching, her skin is peeling, redness and severe headache. On 09Apr2021, the patient experienced motion sickness and numbness of right forearm. On 12Apr2021, the patient had tachycardia and scaling. When probed to determine when the tachycardia began, the caller mentioned that the tachycardia was noted at the doctor&#39;s office. She confirmed the tachycardia began Monday, 12Apr2021. She clarified it was her second doctor&#39;s visit so if the caller gave the wrong date, they were able to find it by her records on her second doctor&#39;s visit. Caller confirmed with her daughter the tachycardia was still intermittent, it comes and goes. It seems to be that it has improved. She could consider it was medically significant because they didn&#39;t know what the root cause was. Her daughter has never experienced tachycardia before being dosed with the Pfizer vaccine. There was not treatment for tachycardia. Her daughter was still having a rash; she was breaking out intermittently. She confirmed she did not report online that her daughter was intermittently breaking out. At that time when she filed the report online, the rash just broke out. At that time, she didn&#39;t know if her daughter&#39;s rash was going to abate and then re-appear. If so, then she would have had to re-open a new event with a new date and time and rate it. She just looked at her daughter&#39;s skin, it&#39;s peeling. These were very itchy. Caller then clarified most of these events started the day of the vaccine, 07Apr2021 at 12:30 PM. She confirmed some of these events were reported online on the date of the incident and were still present. The severity of each event was on a grading scale, and right now her daughter&#39;s grading scale was 10. Online, the patient couldn&#39;t even tell how they really were feeling. The severity of each event needed to be asked. By the lack of getting all the information and the less Pfizer has, the better it looks for Pfizer. When probed for outcome, the caller confirmed the rash was still ongoing and it was medically significant because she was going to have to take her to dermatologist. She has been using hydrocortisone cream as treatment of the rash and it&#39;s not working. She did not have the NDC, LOT,EXP for the cream. She explained the skin peeling/scaling has been ongoing. Her skin breaks out in a rash and then becomes really scaly and then it peels. She clarified overall, she had a rash, but the rash was itching, had redness, scaling, and her skin was peeling. On scale of 1 to 10, the caller would rate this event as a 10. She confirmed and that it&#39;s continuous/ongoing and had not improved. Stated the rash was not to any localized area on her daughter&#39;s body, it&#39;s all over. She clarified further the rash can appear on her daughter&#39;s eyes, chin, cheeks, forearm, wrist, and leg. The severe headache was reported on the day of the vaccine as well as the rash, too. The severe headache was ongoing; caller gives it a grade 10&#43;. She confirmed the headache was medically significant. It did prevent her daughter from driving a car, reading, or doing activities. Caller added that the headache was also disabling because it disables her daughter from functioning at her normal capacity, she&#39;s been hindered. Her normal activities she could not perform if the headache was present. The headache was described as stabbing, excruciating pain and burning sensation. When probed for the outcome of her daughter&#39;s severe headache, the caller explains it&#39;s in between persistent and worsening. On a good day, it&#39;s a grade 8.5. On a bad day, it&#39;s a grade 10&#43;. No medical treatment for headache, she was not really allowed to do anything. She was waiting for Pfizer vaccine to wash out of her daughter&#39;s system. She explained her daughter was laying low and not introducing any more drugs to enter her body since she had a reaction. Caller again stated they were waiting for Pfizer&#39;s vaccine to wash out of her daughter&#39;s system because they feel as though something was triggering the rash that keeps appearing and the headaches were still there on a grade level of 10&#43;. Her daughter was afraid to take medications, so they were having to do treatments like hot compresses to her daughter&#39;s head and neck, massaging her head/neck/back and turning the lights off. The Nausea and vomiting began on 07Apr2021 and was still ongoing. No treatment for nausea. Her daughter just gets still and goes to sleep. When the headaches were excruciating, it brings on nausea and vomiting. Also, she noticed motion sickness. When her daughter was riding in the car and she was experiencing a headache, she had terrible motion sickness. Caller confirmed the caller never had this motion sickness prior to the vaccine. The motion sickness was still ongoing. Her daughter was not treating the motion sickness in any way. She states maybe her daughter has taken one Zofran because it was so bad. No further details provided. The numbness of the right forearm started on 09Apr2021. She confirms the numbness is still ongoing, it comes and goes, intermittently and did not receive any treatment. On 07Apr2021, her entire neck was swelling, left and right side. The left side was better but the rightnside had intermittent swelling, there was ongoing swelling on the right side of her neck and did not receive any treatment and just rubbing of her daughter&#39;s neck. Her daughter also has right upper shoulder discomfort with swelling that goes into her neck that was ongoing. She confirmed this event to be medically significant and it has hindered her daughter&#39;s normal activity if her shoulder was swollen too bad and she was hurting. Her daughter just started physical therapy. The light sensitivity was still ongoing. If her daughter was not experiencing a headache, the light sensitivity was pretty good and treatment included dark rooms/ black out. Her daughter was following up with an allergy testing by the allergy doctor. She has to find out if there were any active ingredients in the Pfizer vaccine that triggered her daughter&#39;s reaction. Caller stated, &#34;something in the COVID-19 vaccine triggered her daughter&#39;s body to react the way that it did&#34;. Her daughter also was following up with a dermatologist. Her primary care physician requested her daughter to be followed up with her allergy doctor and to be tested. Caller requested Pfizer&#39;s adverse team or someone to call and let the caller know how Pfizer follows up with their patients and how well Pfizer&#39;s values each patient. The patient&#39;s symptoms have not abated. The events of swelling, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, motion sickness, hypoaesthesia, musculoskeletal discomfort, photophobia, rash, rash pruritic, skin exfoliation, erythema and headache were considered to be medically significant. The events caused the patient to visit emergency department and physician&#39;s office. The patient received IM Benadryl 50mg and IM Solumedrol steroid as treatment for the events. The outcome of tachycardia was recovering and for burning sensation it was unknown, and for all the other events, it was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events nausea, vomiting, pruritic rash, erythema, and severe headache were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile and close temporal relationship. The association between the events swelling, tachycardia, motion sickness, hpyoaesthesia, musculoskeletal discomfort, photophobia, skin peeling, and scaly skin with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded based on temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

PM starting having extreme itching on dorsal sides of hands, used lotion that I normally use (sensitive skin kind) to see if it was just dryness. Red bumps still on just right hand 1/9/2021 woke up in middle of night to extreme itching and spreading red bumps on both hands. Bumps are small and fluid filled. Took Benadryl and went back to bed after washing hands. Early PM continued extreme itching and spreading bumps to wrists becoming more red and some bumps popping. Later in evening I noticed swelling starting in my hands. I have tried Benadryl cream (not difference) washing hands well (no difference) lotion (worse) hydrocortisone 1% cream (itching worse) swelling went from none to a non pitting edema. Hands hurt and swelling increasing over time more bumps showing up on hands (with no other changes to any products I have used)

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

                                                had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 24-year-old female patient (currently 25-years-old) received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 24-years-old) on 06Jan2021 12:45 at 0.3 mL, single in right deltoid for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899, expiry date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month on 09Jan2021 13:00 with outcome of not recovered. She reported, &#34;I&#39;ve had both doses of the vaccine. The last one was on 06Jan2021. I have had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month.&#34; She says she got the second dose 06Jan2021 and on 09Jan2021 she was at the doctor&#39;s office and he felt what he thought is a swollen lymph node like under her clavicle, it is the size of a golf ball now, it is not going away. She says the swollen lymph node is under the clavicle on her left side. The doctor didn&#39;t seem too concerned about it but it has been almost a month and it is still there she doesn&#39;t know what it is but it is still there. She confirms the second dose was 06Jan2021 and on 09Jan2021 her doctor noticed it was swollen, she didn&#39;t even notice it before he did. She thinks it has gotten worse but she also might be freaking out for no reason but she thinks it has gotten bigger. She says she has the information for the first dose but the second dose is on another card because she forgot the card when she went back for the second dose. The information for the second dose is at home and she is not at home right now. She does not see an NDC Number. She says the lot number information could be available later if needed for follow up because the card is at home. Dose: It is not on the card but she thinks it is 0.3 ml, she doesn&#39;t remember for sure. At the time she got the dose she was being treated for ring worm. Her doctor did draw a Calcium and a PTH and they were both normal. She says the doctor was not too concerned about but it has been almost a month and it still has not gone down (as reported). She has asthma which she has been dealing with kind of on and off because this winter has been so cold but other than that nothing else has happened, her vitals are normal she did not even have any temperature or anything after the vaccine. The event was assessed as non-serious. Vaccination Facility Type was hospital. The adverse event did not require a visit to the Emergency Room or Physician Office. It was noted while she was in the doctors office but she has not had to go back for it. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Anaphylaxis - Throat swelled almost completely closed, wheezing, lightheadedness (nearly passed out), throat/neck and injection site were very itchy and swollen, face/eyes swelled up, turned very pale all over, heart palpitations, etc. The next day - severe, horribly painful burning sensation all throughout my body.  Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

On March 15, 2021 I started with a top left back pain (same side as injection) where is it painful to move and difficult to breathe deeply. I&#39;m not completely sure if this is related to the COVID vaccine but it is on the same side of the site of injection.

While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

They appeared after the first shot but have grown in sensitivity after the 2nd shot. Fever, headache, fatigue and nausea are also apparent symptoms. Today I woke up with pain in my neck, like someone chopped me in the throat. It?s not a sore throat pain, but a hurts to swallow pain.

It&#39;s been almost two weeks since my second dose (March 30,2021). It&#39;s not a huge concern. It&#39;s tender and hurts a little.  No treatments at the moment. I haven&#39;t contacted my doctor yet. If it hasn&#39;t gone away in another 2 weeks or so then I will contact my Doctor.

What&#39;s uncommon is that on 4/14/2021, I began to get hives on my stomach and I&#39;ve never had a hives break-out before receiving my second vaccine dose. On 4/15/2021, I wake up with hives all over my back, butt, stomach, shoulders and arms. My daily routine hasn&#39;t changed accept for getting my second vaccine dose. On 4/16/2021, I wake up at 1am with hives all over my body in the same places as 4/15/2021 but now my face was slightly swollen especially around my under eye area. Throughout each day, the hives would go away but they would come back at night.

A 24-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05May2021 (Lot Number: EW0167) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included weird blood pressure (kind of have weird blood pressure, it goes up and down pretty frequently, no treatment), endometriosis, seizure. Concomitant medications included lamotrigine (LAMOTRIGINE) taken for seizure; quetiapine. The patient had an adverse reaction to the first of the two vaccine shot and wanted to know if she can get the second. She had pretty bad cold and flu symptoms and did have anaphylactic allergies, and swell up like her throat, neck and face swelled a little bit on 06May2021. It wasn&#39;t enough to go to the emergency room. She took Benadryl and kind of monitored but she thought her doctor would have called it like a pre-anaphylactic sort of reaction. The patient was having the reactions on yesterday (06May2021), still didn&#39;t feel good today (07May2021). She started to swell up she took Benadryl and Tylenol because she had slight fever it was 102 (06May2021). So, Tylenol 400 mg (took 2 pills), took 600 mg of Ibuprofen and the Benadryl 200 (200 but not entirely sure). She tried not to take medication unless have to, the moment she started throwing up she took the Benadryl only took that once, her arm was really killing her so she did take the Ibuprofen twice yesterday (06May2021) and twice Wednesday (05May2021). The fever came back yesterday (06May2021). Tylenol, probably the same twice on Wednesday, twice on Thursday, the patient hadn&#39;t had to take any today (07May2021). The outcome of events was not recovered.

A 24-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer Covid shot), dose 2 (at the age of 24 years) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left deltoid on 09May2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing polycystic ovaries from a couple of years ago and allergic to peanut butter from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first shot of bnt162b2 one month ago (Apr2021) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced coughing up blood, feverish, lymph nodes swollen, with bruising under arm/under arm bruised all on 11May2021 after second vaccine. Outcome of events was unknown. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office; no treatment was given. Events coughing up blood, feverish, lymph nodes swollen were reported as serious medically significant, event under arm bruised was non-serious.  Information on Lot/Batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a close temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Suspected bursitis with prolonged arm pain and weakness 2 weeks after first Pfizer dose. On the day of vaccination, I had a panic attack and nearly blacked out after vaccination, something that had never happened to me after a vaccination. Once the pain started a few hours after vaccination, it significantly increased. I experienced excruciating pain in my left arm like I had never felt after any other vaccination. Complete inability to move my arm without pain; the pain persisted even with zero movement whatsoever. Within the first 12 hours the pain spread to my entire left shoulder, and within 24 hours the pain spread to my neck, and general upper left quadrant of my body to the point where inhaling deeply would cause chest pain on my left side. This extreme pain persisted for about 3-4 days. After about the 5th day, my left arm still felt different and weaker than my right arm but little pain remained. After the 7th day, pain started back up whenever I tried to use my arm in any way. The days went on and the pain and arm weakness is not passing. It is minor pains, aches, and occasional throbbing compared to those first few days after vaccination but chronic pain nonetheless. My left arm continues to feel weak and I have a concentrated area of pain directly where the vaccination site was, it&#39;s as if I could still feel exactly where the needle went through my body. My arm feels okay pain-wise upon waking most days but I am unable to do anything as simple as chopping vegetables or washing dishes without feeling pain for the rest of the day. I am unable to even wear a backpack for more than 10 minutes without my left shoulder hurting and feeling fatigued.

                                                I got the vaccine some time in the night when i was taking a shower i noticed arm soreness. when i went to bed around 11pm from the top of my shoulder down to my finger tips it was swollen and had arm pain. I tried to go to bed and about 30 minutes later i went to get up to grab some advil. I checked in the mirror to see if there was redness and got light headed. Next thing i know i passed out. I woke up on the floor and a big pool of blood i dont know how long i was out for. I had a nose bleed and had a bruise on my head, I could leave the bath room because i was shaking so bad and couldnt use any force to get up. After 45 mins that i went to my room and called my mom who is a physican i sat on the floor for 3 or 4 hours until i could get the nose bleed to stop. I ended up then getting into bed and the shacking had stopped after 800 mg of advil. I checked my pupils for signs of cuncussion. the 1/25 i had my first appointment and we checked to see if i broke my nose. after that the next days they did see signs of concussion with sleeping 20 hours a day and blurry vision. I went back to  med center to get an mri and eeg to see about the concussion because they were worried since i didnt know how long i was out for. They also sent me to a concussion specialist. I had follow up care about the concussion for a month or so.  For about a week floowing the vaccine i was taking 800mg 3times a day for the tremor&#39;s and fever

She was slightly swollen under her eye on the right side of her face. The patient refused to stay for further evaluation even upon urging for her to stay. We administered 25mg of Diphenhydamine and gave her another 25mg tablet to take once she gets home. We reached out to PCP. We called the patient about 25 minytes after she left and she told us that she was doing well and would call if it worsened.

She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Was driving home after waiting my 15 minutes. Throat started to close up, tingling sensation throughout entire body, rush of heat, dizziness, increased heart rate. Made it back to the site (closest medical professionals near me) where my throat still felt swollen but I could breathe. Chest hurt and was still dizzy. Was given 50mg Benadryl &amp; 20mg Pepsid. It seemed to come and go in waves but I still went to the ER. ER doc said what he saw I was experiencing was anxiety. Pharmacist who had been with me the whole time could tell that my neck and throat had been swollen but had gone down with the Benadryl. ER administered anti nausea meds and a steroid shot. Also prescribed steroids for a few days. Received the shot at 6:45, initial reaction occurred around 7:10, went to the ER around 8:45

Intense muscle aches, worse two days after the vaccine, instead of just one day after. Aching of the muscles around the eyes (the ones you would use to squint and the top of the cheeks), the scalp, neck (the base of the skull and trapezius), biceps, aching around the wrist joints, hip flexors, quadriceps, and ankle joints. Found relief with 500 mg acetaminophen throughout the day.

I exited the building and once I got into my car my face (specifically under my eyes and on my cheeks) began swelling and a red burning rash appeared. By the time I got home (10 more minutes) I needed Benadryl immediately, I was not able to complete my sentences and all other symptoms had become more intense. I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours for the next few days due to the symptoms consistently rebounding. I had one episode of throat tightness but it passed without use of my epipen. I checked my pulse and blood pressure frequently with the lowest reading being 93/60. Lethargy, shakiness, confusion, high heart rate all are still present after 5 days. The rash went away after 48 hours.

                                                Patient developed headache, fever and extreme sweating the evening after vaccination. Also, she developed gum swelling, purple spots on the gums, sores in the mouth, and fever blisters on the lips. Symptoms worsened and patient went to the facility to get a COVID test, which was negative. Over the weekend, patient developed swollen lymph nodes/neck and also noticed a lump in the left breast (same side as vaccination). Patient was nursing 11 month old and supply diminished (never returned). Went to stat care and was diagnosed with strep throat over the weekend. About 2 weeks post-vaccinations symptoms resolved and lump in breast no longer present.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

By 2:00pm, had slurred speech; severe fatigue; red skin on hands, face, neck; balance problems and dizziness; swollen hands. That evening through the next morning, I was experienced severe flu-like symptoms, including vertigo, extremely severe fatigue, and full-body muscle aches. My temperature was slightly elevated (98.7) from my &#34;baseline,&#34; which is around 96.7. On Saturday, I was very tired, no appetite, still experiencing some vertigo and muscle aches. Symptoms improved overnight and by Sunday evening, I was mostly back to normal, with some lingering fatigue.

                                                About 30 seconds after the injection I felt a strange sharp pain right under where the injection site was. I was advised to sit near the nurses station for 30 minutes instead of 15 due to my medical history. One of the nurses came by to check on me and as we were chatting my entire left shoulder and up my neck suddenly got red and rashy. I looked down and both of my arms were rashy as well. I began to experience itching everywhere. The nurse gave me 50 mg of benedryl and monitored me for about 40 minutes. The rash went down and they had my husband come pick me up. I called my pcp and advised them or the situation. She asked to keep her informed and if anything got worse to administer the Epi-Pen and go to the ER. Once home I slept for about 5 1/2 hours and then woke up in the afternoon. I had a minor headache and my arm had started to swell, but the rash was completely gone. As of today my arm is still red and swollen under the injection site, and itches quite a lot.

                                                About 10 minutes after the second dose, I noticed the hives and irritation come on my throat, neck and my arm. I talked to the people who were monitoring and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl and they kept me for 45- one hour. They Benadryl took about 20-30 minutes to for having the hives and irritation go away. After that happened, I went home and I started to get body aches and feeling very fatigued; a little bit nauseous.  I did have some soreness and swelling on my arm after vaccine that lasted two or three days. The fatigue and body aches lasted for one day. The hives and irritation on my throat and neck and arm didn&#39;t come back after the dose of Benadryl.  I had a doctor appt on Feb 8 about the side affects of the vaccine - he told me if hives came back to take Benadryl.

I recieved the injection in my right arm. It was a dull achey pain but upon palpation became a sharp shooting pain that radiated from my armpit into my back and under my ribcage. There was also swelling and it to hurt have my right arm resting along my side.  Today, on 4/2/21, I am still experiencing this pain, however, it is less severe. To treat, I have been taking 2 acetominaphen approximately every six hours. It still hurts if I am to rest my arm at my side.

                                                I&#39;d had Bell&#39;s Palsy (BP) twice in my life (once in 2013 and once in 2015). I have not had it since 2015 until I got vaccinated on 3/29/21 and began to develop BP symptoms on the evening of 4/6/21 (headache on right side of my head/temple, odd sensation on right side of my tongue, almost like I burned it on a hot beverage) but I didn&#39;t think anything of it. I went to sleep and then, on the morning of 4/7/21, I woke up feeling extremely fatigued, brain fogged, and weak. I didn&#39;t notice any of the BP symptoms until I went to brush my teeth and realized I had lost motor function in the right side of my mouth. I immediately made a telehealth appointment with an Urgent Care doctor in order to get an Rx of Prednisone. I began taking the Prednisone around 3pm on Wednesday, 4/7/21. I also have been taking vitamin B-12 and a Women&#39;s Multivitamin to help regenerate nerve function.  However, since starting the prednisone, my symptoms have continued to develop. Symptoms currently include: right side of my face is extremely swollen; I have lost mobility on the right side of my face, the right side of my tongue still feels numb; right eye tearing non-stop; some mild ear pain in right inner ear; slight pins-and-needles sensation in my fingers on my right hand; difficulty eating and drinking; still feeling fatigued.  I have recovered from BP twice before so I am not too worried about having it again. I just think the FDA needs to put out a warning to the public that there may be a correlation between the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and Bell&#39;s Palsy recurrences. I know this is not a coincidence, and my BP relapse was a result of my body experiencing an immune reaction from the vaccine.

It was very painful to move my arm or leave my arm resting in a normal position since it would put pressure on my lymph node. I had very limited mobility on days 2,3 and 4 after the vaccine but quickly improved starting day 5 with very minimal pain. I had a video call with a doctor who recommended 800mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours &amp; warm compress on the lymph node. In general, I had very minimal symptoms from the first vaccine except the lymph node swelling &amp; pain. Starting day 5 post vaccine I was basically back to normal &amp; have felt good ever since.

Numbness began within the first hour. Within two hours, I lost strength and 60% use of my left hand. The pinky and ring finger of my left hand have been either completely numb or tingling ever since my shot over one week ago.   I noticed mild numbness about 3-4 days after the first dose, but assumed I had just slept funny. When my arm became red and hand became tingly after my second dose, I realized this was an effect of the vaccine and not merely a pinched nerve in my sleep.

                                                The first dose of the Pfizer vaccine was taken on March 15th at 8:30. Within a week I started feeling weak joints, headaches followed by a sharp pain on the occipital lobe. I started my period for the second time that month, which was odd because it never happened to me before. I went to work that week, but by Friday (March 30th) I was not able to handle the pain so after work I went to the doctor and they took blood to see if there was anything going on. The result came back the following day and everything was normal. I was given medicine (muscle relaxers) for the occipital pain, but it was not enough. At that time I was not sure what was the cause of it, I thought it was a bad flu, but I didn&#39;t come to the conclusion that it was because of the vaccine, because a week had passed by, so I thought it was impossible. The doctor asked for me to take an X-Ray for the occipital pain, so I did (March 30th) and it resulted in everything being fine. She also recommended for me to get an abdominal ultrasound to see if my uterus was fine due to the second period. I currently took the second Pfizer dose in the same location, but this time around I felt all of these symptoms within 3 hours of the vaccination. I started feeling lightheaded and dazed, my joints started feeling weak, my mouth and tongue started feeling sensitive (fever blisters and sensitive to anything that is acidic, spicy, etc).  I have not visited the doctor this time around because the pain is tolerable. I have noticed in increase of joint pain as the days go by.

                                                About an hour after her vaccine, patient called and said that she was nauseous, vomiting, had passed out twice, a rash from the injection site up to her throat, and her arm was swollen from the elbow up.  I told her to take Benadryl and to go to the ER or to the immediate care.  I followed up with her the next day and she went to the ER, she said the Benadryl helped her out significantly and that she was feeling much better that day.  She was still inquiring about the second shot but, she was following up with her MD on Wednesday.

                                                Within 1 hour of receiving the vaccine, I had mild tongue swelling, shortness of breath, fingers swelling, intense sweating and faintness. Within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine, hives developed on my left thigh. The tongue swelling, shortness of breath and faintness happened on and off for the first day. It resolved on its own by the next day. The hives got progressively worse and peaked roughly 48 hours after getting the vaccine. They slowly faded, but are still faintly noticeable. I had general malaise  for the rest of the week. I have photos showing the progression of the hives.

A bad migraine, unable to stand because it caused so much pain in my head. at 8:00PM I went to bed due to the pain. at 1:15 AM, my body was in pain. My right rib cage hurt so bad that I couldn&#39;t sleep on my right side. My legs, back, and pelvic bones were in so much pain as well. I felt as if my bones were going to break or I had severely bruised my bones. Breathing, coughing, sneezing hurt because of my rib cage hurting. My migraine had not gone away, and my lymph nodes were really swollen. Couldn&#39;t put my arms down, my neck was swollen and walking hurt because my legs were swollen. This occurred for 24 hours. Next day, migraine is gone and left a headache. Swelling is still prominent and bones still hurt.

My headaches have gotten worse and I haven&#39;t had much of an appetite.

A 25-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: En6203), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on an unspecified date (at the age of 25-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnant. Medical history included COVID prior vaccination on unspecified date. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included unspecified birth control pills. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: En9581) in the right arm on 09Feb2021 at 02:00 PM (at the age of 25-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine in four weeks. On 21Mar2021 at 14:00 after her second vaccine the patient had an anaphylactic reaction. It was something she had eaten before so not new to her body. It happened again on 27Apr2021. Still from things she eats normally. Both occurrences happened 30 minutes after eating and came on quickly.

Not as bad, is mostly gone the next morning. Still itchy, and left behind small whitehead like bumps on a few of the worse patches.

                                                On May 11 (ten days after second shot), I broke out in full body hives (face, arms, legs, entire abdomen). Extreme itchiness all over body - unable to sleep. Body was entirely red with raised white welts.  Visited urgent care doctors, dermatologist, and allergist. Landed on a treatment plan with the allergist with a strong dose of steroids and antihistamines, which have mostly resolved the symptoms as of 5/18 (Biaxin, Medrol, Probiotic, Pepcid, Xyzal, Allegra, Benadryl). I was prescribed a Prednisone taper along with Zyrtec from Urgent Care on May 12, but my symptoms did not improve until starting the allergist&#39;s plan on 5/15.

Pfizer shot #1 was administered on 3/12/2021 with minimal effects lasting less than 24 hours (arm soreness, flu-like symptoms, etc.).  1) Severe worsening of costochondritis (chronic chest pain) to the point of breathing difficulty and inability to lie down. Began 4/1/2021 and became unbearable the evening of 4/7/2021, requiring an ER trip the same night (see Item 19). This pain has since continued to come and go, worse than I ever had it before the vaccine.  2) Very severe worsening of tinnitus (ringing/pulsing in ears) - lasted 1.5 months, from 4/1/2021 to around 5/15/2021.  3) Severe hormone imbalance symptoms (waves of severe nausea occurring several times daily, extremely late and painful/heavy period, swelling in ankles &amp; feet, etc.) for ~1.5 months, from late April 2021 to around 5/15/2021. I cannot identify any other changes or life factors besides the vaccine that would have caused these issues.

A contactable consumer (patient herself) reported that a 25-year-female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number and expiration date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient medical history included She was allergic to clams and COVID-19. Concomitant medications were not reported. Lab data included as blood work on an unspecified date results reported as allergic to clams (seafood) and COVID-19 test on an unspecified date in Jan2021 with positive results. On 23Apr2021 she got hives and rashes all over face, arms and chest thighs. On 23Apr2021 at night she went to the ER. They gave her Benadryl and steroids to see what happens. They did not prescribed anything, got one Benadryl and one steroid. They told her to just to observe. The next day she was fine. On 24Apr2021 started to get the hives again. On 27Apr2021 it was reported as patient lips and eyes were swollen and she saw her doctor and had blood work to see if she was allergic to anything. She was allergic to clams (seafood) but nothing else. In Apr 2021 she experienced chills, fever it was normal but two weeks later she got all these rashes and hives. Her doctor gave me Benadryl for 10 days and steroid for 5 days. She was scheduled on 29Apr2021 for the 2nd dose. She did not get, doctor wanted me to wait until she was done with steroids. Two days ago, her steroids were done, hives were going away it was the 28th and 29th her arms hurt. On the 29th her back started the same thing (like my hands and arms). Her muscles were hurting so much, felt like poking me with needles. On 02May2021 back started having the same problems. She was COVID positive in Jan and got better from it. Caller asked if there was seafood in the vaccine. Response was received as shellfish, fish, seafood and emailed as requested. She had a side effect after the first dose of the vaccine. It was asked as should she get the second dose and response was she should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if she had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if she had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. She had a bad reaction on the 23Apr had a swollen lips and neck. The outcome of events (Fever and chills) was recovered on an unspecified date in Apr2021 and unknown for other events.  Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                So on the Saturday after my vaccine, I was having chest pains which were like shooting pains which was pretty strange. I was driving so I pulled over and had some water then continued on. I had dinner and it continued, these shooting pains in my chest. I called the paramedics and had them evaluate me. They hooked me up to an EKG machine and they were alarmed and they recommended I go with them to the ER. I don&#39;t really know why they were that alarmed, I didn&#39;t feel that bad. The paramedic was like I have been working in cardiac care for 15 years. They wouldn&#39;t even allow me to walk down my stairs, they put me in a wheelie thing and I got in the paramedic vehicle. They said I was having premature ventricular contractions. They tested my blood levels and all that stuff and I was not having any indication of a heart attack or anything. They sent me home the next day, on 4/4/2021.

Naproxen and colchicine started empirically which alleviated her pain. Patient&#39;s chest pain is still persisting daily 4 months later, although no longer constant. Chest pain now lasts few minutes at a time without clear trigger.  Pt is not pregnant, no history of drug allergy, no medical history of other illness.

                                                Immediately after getting the shot within 2 minutes I started feeling very flushed and very warm. I did not have difficulty breathing so they sent me home, I took my jacket off and I had a rash from my neck, across my collar bone, across my chest and my back. My neck felt super tight so I ended up going to urgent care they did blood work and they said it must have been a swollen lymph node. They sent me to the hospital and they did an ultrasound, and it came back as nonconclusive, I also had like the more traditional symptoms, head aches, stomach ache. By the time I had the ultrasound it had already been a month. the normal symptoms went away after the week,  but the tightness in my neck persisted for the whole month. They did the ultrasound and blood work and the official diagnosis was a lymphatic reaction. I was really just having difficulty swallowing and laying flat. After urgent care and had the us I followed up with my PCP and she prescribed some steroids. It took about 2 months to fully settle back down and for the inflammation to go away. Because I had trouble swallowing solid foods I lost about 20 pounds.

This is second out of 2 reports with second dose information. A 25-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: EW0196; Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 02Jul2021 (at the age of 25-years-old) as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Investigation assessment, additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect, prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) included none. Family medical history included neoplasm malignant (cancer) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously took Prevnar 13 for pneumonia (last vaccine patient got 6 months ago, they actually told her that this vaccine might have a chance of lesser mitigated side effects but that was not the case. Patient reported that last one was. She was in another country and there you can get Prevnar 13 at any age not as like 65 or 67 like it was here. Patient did not have NDC lot expiration for the Prevnar 13 she received. Adverse events following prior vaccinations included none and was surprised because she had never had reactions). Flu vaccine (patient stated she reacts badly to the flu vaccine. Patient did not have any NDC lot expiration for the flu vaccine she received, did not get the flu vaccine in 10 years because she reacted badly and did not get the flu in 10 years) and took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EW0217), via unspecified route in left arm on 11Jun2021 (at the age of 25-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced arm hurt a little and had swollen lymph nodes. At 03Jul2021 06:00, the patient experienced nausea, a weird pain, she will be fine but if anything touches her like clothes or the couch when she sits down everything burns, it irritates her skin, her neck is stiff, sweating, chills, fever. On the same day, the patient also experienced she could not eat, her lymph nodes are still swollen now and it has been over a month, they got even bigger with the second dose on 03Jul2021. Patient was calling about the vaccine she was told to call here and basically report her effects. She clarified it was the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She does not have mailing address or email. Patient said the first vaccine was fine, her arm hurt a little. Her mother got it at the same time same place, and she was fine but the caller&#39;s hurt a little bit, but her mother felt great. And again, after the second dose her mother felt perfect, she had not had a single side effect. Caller said for herself it was different, she was fine for the first 12 hours, she got the second dose at 6:30 PM on 02Jul2021 (Friday) at 6AM on 03Jul2021 (Saturday) she was burning with fever it started and got to around 101 degrees. She was sweating, and had chills and that was everything to be expected but what really confused her was her lymph nodes, she wasn&#39;t told at the pharmacy they could swell and suddenly she felt this one under her arm and had cancer in her family so she freaked out but then they told her it could be from the vaccine but basically it cause her lymph node to swell and it felt like there is an egg it was the size of a mushroom under her skin. She was 25 years old, and her neck is stiff, it had been a week and she could barely move her neck her back and just everything hurts. it is a weird pain, she will be fine but if anything touched her like clothes or the couch when she sat down everything burns, it irritated her skin. She couldn&#39;t eat, she was nauseous she threw up water. It was awful she drank a little water and threw it right up. All the events began the next day of vaccination, 03Jul2021 at 6 AM in the morning, 12 hours after the second dose. She clarifies the swollen lymph nodes began after the first vaccine, she got the first dose on 11Jun2021 and maybe on 13Jun2021 she was in the shower and felt the lump and freaked out and began calling doctors and they said she had just got the vaccine and it could be that but she is still going to have it checked out because there was triple negative in her family and her lymph nodes are still swollen now and it has been over a month, they got even bigger with the second dose. Patient mother was worried because she was trying to get the patient to eat something, but she couldn&#39;t eat, she just didn&#39;t expect that to be a side effect, everything felt disgusting with the nausea, it was not fun. They said a very low percentage have the swollen lymph nodes, so she wanted to report. Patient did not see expiration date or NDC number on vaccine card. They just have the date when administered. And did not have any dose information, it was injection to the left arm for both first and second dose. Indication was stated as to not get COVID. Grandmother, mother, aunt, and best friend of patient were all high risk, so patient wanted to be vaccinated. Vaccination time was reported as 6:30 or 7 PM. Patient asked there if was going to be a third shot right, like a booster, because she was dreading it since getting the second shot. Caller declined to be transferred for questions about potential booster dose of the vaccine and declined to be provided with phone number to medication information. On 03Jul2021, the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101 degrees. The clinical outcome of the events was unknown.
