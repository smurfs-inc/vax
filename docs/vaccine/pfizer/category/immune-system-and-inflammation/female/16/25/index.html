It was slightly itchy but not painful. 2. The area on her back worsened over the next 2-3 weeks and developed dark black scabs. 3. 24 hours after the second vaccine dose (which was given on 2/20/21), she developed scattered lesions on her neck, hairline, ear, face ? some with blisters, some with scabbed tops. Again slightly itchy but not painful. She also had a transient headache and chills that resolved on their own that same day.

She woke up about 14 hours later with vaccine side effects the family was prepared for, including headache, chills, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. This all resolved within 48 hours. Approximately  one week later, the child woke up again in the night with severe chills in the middle of the night. It was a sudden onset following a week of feeling well. She had to sit in a warm/hot shower for an hour to get warm. She described it as &#34;freezing to death.&#34; She has never experienced anything like this before.

Found to have enhancement of 6th and 3rd CNs on MRI. Patient continued to have blurry and double vision during her stay and mild gait instability. She developed mild frontal headache managed with Tylenol. Her exam was remarkable for mydriasis, mild lateral gaze limitation R&gt;L, mild dysmetria, dizziness and unsteady gait without notable ataxia. No papilledema. Her reflexes were 2&#43; in her BL UE and LEs.  Pediatric Neurology and ophthalmology consulted and followed patient. Eye exam remarkable for bilateral cranial nerve 6 palsy but no other element of CN3 palsy and bilateral dilated but unreactive pupils. Patient treated with IVIG 1mg/kg/day x2 days for likely miller fisher syndrome variant of Guillain-Barre.

                                                Eleven days later, she got another allergic reaction with blister on her arm, water filled blister; She got blister on the opposite arm of the injection, on her right arm; Diagnosed her with a skin disease that happens when your immune system is under attack; Her arm is now swollen around the blister; bullous pemphigoid; cellulitis; Had an allergic reaction; Itchiness; They gave her a high dose/received a higher dose of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 17-years-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Apr2021 at 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ew0153) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma seasonal only during allergy season. No episodes this year. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  Concomitant medications included Multivitamin/women&#39;s one a day gummies. The parent reported that her daughter had the vaccine done on 10Apr2021 and she had an allergic reaction that evening, she had itchiness. So, I contacted the pharmacist that she had an allergic reaction and she told me that they gave her a high dose and there were few patients who got the high dose. So, eleven days later, she got another allergic reaction with blister on her arm, water filled blister, I took her to an urgent care and they referred me to a dermatologist that diagnosed her with a skin disease that happens when your immune system is under attack (event captured as per verbatim). So, I went to her primary doctor and her primary doctor has put her on antibiotic because her arm is now swollen around the blister, so now, she is on ointment, antibiotic and vitamin d (treatment) to bring up her immune system and also she has to get her blood work done to check her immune system. She also stated that the reaction my daughter is now having and how her primary doctor is suggesting not to take her second dose because she highly thinks it is an allergic reaction to the vaccine.&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered.         Reported Event: Four hours after the injection on 10Apr2021 (Name) entire body began to itch and the top of mouth. The pharmacist was notified and at the time and further explained that (Name) was one of the patients that day who received a higher dose of the vaccine at the time of injection. The pharmacist did not notify me of how high the dosage was. So I cannot put the exact details on this report because I was not given that information by the pharmacist. I suggest the pharmacist be contacted for the exact mistaken dosage. The second side effect was on 21Apr2021 (Name) woke up with a water filled blister on her right arm which ruptured with a yellow liquid. We seeked medical attention on 21Apr2021 and 23Apr2021 from 3 different facilities. The outcome was (Name) being diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid and cellulitis. (Name) was placed on cephalexin 500mg, vitamin d 50mcg/2000 units, mupirocin 2%, and fluconazole 150 mg to build her immune system back up.

The patient spent two days in the hospital, barely able to stand, getting a head MRI with contrast, evaluated for vertigo, blood tests, and they did not find anything and gave her vertigo medicine and sent her home. She has since had shifting symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, irregular heartbeat, severe upper back and neck pain. She has barely been able to move for several weeks and has seen an ENT doctor, another emergency doctor, and her regular doctor. None have found any other cause and have tried treating her with steroids. The events were treated with Meklazine and unspecified steroids. Lab data included SARS-CoV-2 test COVID 19 testing on 28Jan2021 which was negative. The clinical outcomes of headache, dizziness, vertigo, difficulty standing, swollen glands, irregular heart rate, back pain, neck pain and unable to more for several weeks were reported as not recovered.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                I got the shot around 5:20. About 4 hours later I started to feel nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. About an hour after that I had diarrhea. I went to bed, couldn?t fall asleep until 3. I woke up at 6 am sweating a lot and having body aches that were very persistent and painful in my legs. This persisted to 3/12/2021 until about 6 or 7 pm and I began to feel a lot better. That entire day I was hot and cold and had body aches. But no longer had vomiting. Then on Saturday, 3/13/2021 I woke up with a sore left armpit and neck but the armpit was way worse. I looked it up ?sore left armpit after covid vaccine? and it said swollen lymph nodes - so I?m guessing that?s what both pains were as my roommate who had the second dosage of Pfizer vaccine  the week before had a protruding lymph node on her neck. They both are still in pain until today 3/15/2021.

Around 2:00 on 3/11/2021, patient felt a chill, her temperature was 100.4 F orally. Temperature further increased to 103 F around 13:00 on 3/12/2021.   What happened as a result of the adverse event? (doctor visit, ED or urgent care visit, hospitalization, life threatening illness, disability/permanent damage, death, none of these): none of these, took OTC apap last night and this morning and just took ibuprofen after the 103 F reading.  Spoke with patient&#39;s mother, who stated that the is feeling fine. The patient&#39;s temperature is currently 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and initially came back to normal at 02:00 today (3/13/21). The patient experienced elevated temperatures before that time (02:00), of note was at 22:00 on 3/12/21, at which time the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. A later temperature after 22:00 on 3/12/21, and before 02:00 on 3/13/21, was recorded, which was 101 degrees Fahrenheit.   The patient&#39;s mother stated that the daughter may have COVID based upon speaking with her doctor, so she inquired if her daughter should be tested for the presence of antibodies against COVID-19. Patient&#39;s mother also inquired if there was a need for the second shot if it was seen that her daughter had antibodies against the virus.  Advised the mother that her questions would be looked into for answers, and that she would be called back with those answers.

                                                The day after the vaccination I started getting a sore right TMJ. I waited a week to see if it would go away, but it didn&#39;t. I then took aleve and ibuprofen for about two days which decreased the TMJ pain and it did not return. It was then that I noticed that I had a tender swollen lymph node under the right side of my chin. I assume that the swollen lymph node was the cause of the TMJ pain.

                                                From the beginning, I had extremely enlarged lymph nodes and felt fatigued. Every day my lymph nodes grew until they were the size of golf balls. On Tuesday morning at 2:30 AM, I began to have a fever and developed a mild full body rash. This severely escalated and by Wednesday, I developed full body hives and uncontrollable fevers as high as 105. Since then, I have been anti-histamines and steroids, which made my rash worse but helped the fever and lymph nodes. My hives are painful, itchy, and getting worse.

The patient experienced anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. She stated that her daughter continued to have anaphylactic reactions and had to go to the hospital every day since then. The clinical course was reported as follows: her daughter and her husband went to get the vaccine together on 17Apr2021. They went to a facility giving the Pfizer vaccine, and the reporter stated that her daughter was asked, and she did tell them, that she could not receive the flu vaccine that had the additives in it because she was allergic to it. The reporter stated that her daughter was not taking the flu shot for years. She stated that her daughter was allergic to Biaxin but could take Zithromax because of the different additives. They had no idea what the preservative was, but it was obviously in the flu shot so they stopped getting the flu shot until they stopped putting the preservative in the vaccine. The reporter stated that her daughter received the COVID-19 vaccine and within two minutes her daughter told her dad that she was having a hard time breathing. Her daughter walked over to the city EMS who were on site and told them that she was having a hard time breathing. They treated her and then took her to hospital via ambulance. She was treated at the hospital and they were hesitant to discharge her because they were worried about her bounce back. This was exactly what has happened. Every night since the vaccine she has had to take her daughter into the hospital. Every day was a nightmare of either EpiPen injections, Tagamet, Benadryl or prednisone and ended up in the ER every day, where they give her IV Benadryl and send her home. The caller stated that her daughter&#39;s symptoms start with ginormous welts and then an itching to the back of the throat. She had seen a ginormous rash on her daughter&#39;s face that came and went and then it would be on her chest, face, neck and shoulders and migrated wherever. She saw dark purple on her daughter&#39;s face yesterday before she went to the ER. Her skin will blotch, and she will say that her throat feels tight like when she had a reaction to penicillin. She stated that her daughter used to get this when she they would give her penicillin; she would have that reaction every time she got penicillin and they finally said she was allergic to it. The caller states that after those symptoms started, she called EMS and they took her to a hospital. The caller stated she took her daughter to another hospital and they medicated her with IV Benadryl and fluids. Her primary care doctor told the emergency room staff to discharge the patient and that he would give her specific medications to go home with. He called in the medications, but they did not work. He gave her specific medication that did not work, half of her face was turning purple. The purple face was then replaced by an area approximately 1 inch wide on cheek between temple and the jaw. It was 1.5 inches long and was red and looked like a rash or welt. The patient would take an inhaler when she started to have breathing difficulties. That was when the reporter was like &#34;here she goes again&#34;. It felt like it almost made her asthma worse and had to treat that as well. There was a little oddity when they did blood work on her daughter and her white blood count was high and was probably her body reacting to the COVID-19 vaccine. So, she went back to the hospital. The nurses said there was nothing they could do for her, and she needed to find an allergist. The reporter stated that she was tired of the ER visits and wanted her daughter to get better. She stated that she doubled the dose of her daughter&#39;s Tagamet. She stated that the patient&#39;s face and neck swells and she would get tachycardia. The reporter stated that she would not take her daughter to the hospital anymore. The hospital did not think it could be related to the vaccine, but she had not done anything else. The reporter wanted to report this event because she did not think people were taking this seriously. She stated that no one believed it was related to the vaccine, so they were not getting help. She wanted to know if this was a side effect and what could she do about it. She also inquired on whether her daughter should get the second shot. She stated that her daughter would not get the second shot. She had heard that if you had any reaction to the vaccine, then you should not receive the second dose. Her daughter&#39;s doctors have told her to receive the second vaccine. The reporter also stated that she wondered if this was some mast cell activation due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The reporter also asked if Pizer made a preservative free vaccine. Upon follow-up received on 27Apr2021, the patient called to report that she was still experiencing side effects from the anaphylactic reaction and it had been 10 days since administration. She was told it would last about 4-10 days and then be gone, but it had continued, and it had been over 10 days. She had no new symptoms, other than a lot of bone pain. The bone pain made it feel like her bones were shattering. She went to the ER yesterday where they did blood work and said that all of her white blood cell counts were elevated. The anaphylaxis lasted from 17Apr2021 and subsided in that sense on 24Apr2021.  Since then she still had the chest pain, some trouble breathing, and felt like she was having an asthma attack. She had been back and forth to the ER several times since 17Apr2021. The ER kept ruling her symptoms as a reaction to the vaccine. She had been using epinephrine as needed. The patient stated that she was not planning on receiving the second dose due to her reaction. She wanted to know where she should go from here. She wanted to know if this would last forever and how much longer could her symptoms last. The clinical outcomes of the events ginormous welts/rash or welt 1.5 inches by 1 inch on cheek, itching in back of throat and a lot of bone pain were not recovered/not resolved; dark purple on face was recovered/resolved on 21Apr2021; outcomes of all other events were unknown.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height. AE Details and time of onset: Sore Throat 12:00 on 29 Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling 20:00 Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102: 21:00 Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes- 21:00 Migraine- 21:00 Frequent Urination 23:00 Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids 23:00 Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in: 21:00. ER or physician&#39;s office required: Went to urgent care 36 hours after administration. No treatment given. She just wanted to make sure no additional infection was causing anything weird. All test were negative. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): none. Events Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in, Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102 were serious with criteria of medically significant, while the other events were non-serious. The outcome of the event Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling/Sore throat (Condition worsened) was unknown, the outcome of the events Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in, Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102., Migraine, Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids, Frequent urination was recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

Treated with ibuprofen. 21 hours post vaccination was the peak of the symptoms, temperature of 101.6 with ibuprofen, strong body aches, weakness, and anorexia. Symptoms became more mild at hour 31 post vaccine. I had a swollen lymph node after the first vaccine above my left collarbone (injected on left side) and still have this, and now I have a swollen armpit that is very painful on my right side (injected on the right side).

Now on day 4 of this reaction, it has grown bigger and the pain is intense and spread all the way down my arm and to my breasts. My arm will go numb from time to time as well. I am also feeling as if I should have a fever but I do not and feel overall not well.

                                                The first day 1/07/21 I started with a pain on my throat , my throat felt really sore however I was still able to eat . The following day 1/08/21 I still had a sore throat I was able to eat , but at the end of the night I got a fever me temperature was 102.0 . I knew all these symptoms were normal but being that on 1/09/21 It was painful for me to swallow I went to immediate care where they said I still had a fever and told me I had a swollen tonsil on the left side of the mouth which is also the side I received the vaccine on. I still continued to have a fever . Saturday night I noticed I had gotten some small sores on my mouth also on the left side . On Sunday I had loose stool , but I have been eating very soft foods because of my throat . Which then I went to go see a dentist and she said they appeared to be fever blisters , those popped I have a couple on my tongue as well . As of today my throat pain feels to be getting better .I did start a oral mouth rinse also for the sores

Rash continued to spread to lower back and stomach over the next few days with the left arm being the most affected area. Facial redness and swelling occurred however breathing was never affected.  Benadryl did not provide much relief. Visited an urgent care which classified it as an allergic reaction and started 5 day course of prednisone on 12/28/2020. Symptoms resolved upon completion of the prednisone. Total duration of symptoms was approximately one week. I had not used any new skin products or eaten any foods new to my diet and nothing else comes to mind as a potential contributing factor.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                First 2 days after vaccination, I had some injection site pain that was improving. Day 5 after vaccination, I developed lymphadenopathy on my left side with swelling into the chest area developing on day 6. Day 8 after vaccination, my injection site turned red and itchy and I began to have trouble breathing. I went to urgent care.  I saw P. A. She said that it was more likely that the difficulty breathing would be due to my asthma, but she could not recommend whether or not I should receive my second dose. She proscribed 20mg of Prednisone and refilled my albuterol prescription. About 20 hours later, my breathing is still difficult and my arm still itches.  We also discussed that the respiratory symptoms could be caused or exasperated by COVID-19, so I am waiting on results from a covid test.

However, on the 28th of January, I woke up with supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on my left side of my neck. So, I have swelling and lumps/growths above my left collar bone. My left arm is numb and tingly and I feel very sick. I am nauseous and have body aches. I went to urgent care and they believe it is a reaction to the vaccine. I was tested for mono and strep throat and do not have either. I took a rapid covid test on Wednesday the 27th and it was negative.

There were no medical history and no concomitant medications. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Patient reported that she experienced swelling and pain at the injection site on 11Jan2021, she didn&#39;t feel any pain until that night around 4 or 5pm. By Thursday, 14Jan2021, she woke up and felt better, she didn&#39;t have any pain or swelling. Patient reported that on 18Jan2021, on the right side of her face under her jaw she noticed her lymph node was swollen and she described it as &#34;not terrible just a constant pain.&#34; She would like to know if this was a common side effect, and if how long should she wait before she could contact her doctor about this side effect. These were the only symptoms she experienced. The swelling has stayed the same. She did not know if the swollen lymph node could be from the COVID vaccine or not. Patient stated if the swollen lymph node was not a part of the symptoms for the COVID vaccine, she definitely needs to go see a doctor. The events were considered as non-serious by the reporter. The events did not require a visit to emergency room nor the physician office. The outcome of swollen lymph node and lymph node pain was not recovered; while pain and swelling at injection site recovered on 14Jan2021.

                                                About 1.5-2 hours post immunization the patient returned having developed a headache and a quarter sized welt that was lightly red, swollen and very tender to touch, just below her left collar bone about 4 inches from the injection site. The welt was outlined and observed and the patient was given 25mg of Benadryl. After about 20 minutes the swelling and tenderness had spread to an area approximately the diameter of a tennis ball. At this point she was refered to see a doctor at the Health Center. The nurse called to follow-up once the patient arrived as she had not seen this type of reaction after the vaccine. After discussion the physician was going to look at her. Reportedly the swelling had begun to retract and the patient apparently returned to work later that day, talking about her plans to receive the second dose.

A 23-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 02Mar2021, 16:15, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, covid back in Dec2020, known allergies to flu vaccine and TB test and seizure (have history). Concomitant medications included levetiracetam (KEPPRA), lamotrigine (LAMICTAL), cenobamate (XCOPRI) and magnesium. The patient had no other vaccine in 4 weeks. On 02Mar2021 16:15, the patient experienced arm swelling, pain, itching, couldn&#39;t feel lower legs, extreme chest pains and chills. On 02Mar2021, at 17:15, the patient experienced headache an hour later. On 03Mar2021 01:00, the patient experienced seizure at the middle of the night around 01:00. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had Covid prior vaccination; and was not Covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of event seizure was not recovered; outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient had underlying epilepsy. However, based on the close temporal association, a possible contributory role of bnt162b2 to the development of seizure cannot be excluded.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I received the Pfizer vaccine on Friday afternoon, and the rash presented on the face (both cheeks and forehead), chest, and both arms on Saturday morning.  I also woke up with puffy cheeks, and the swelling is now gone.  The facial rash is itchy, and there is tiny pustules present?however, no shortness of breath, sore throat, fever, anaphylaxis, or other severe symptoms.

                                                I got my vaccine on 3/19 at 10am. My 6:30 pm on 3/19 my face got dark red, almost purple and started to swell. I went to and urgent care where they gave me a 50 mg shot of Benadryl. AFter about 20 minutes the reaction was getting better so they released me to go home. They told me to continue taking the Benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 2-3 days. I did as directed for through the night and the next day. Around 6:30 pm on 3/20 I started feeling very tired, shaky, and dazed. My about 9:00 that evening I began to feel swelling in  my throat/tongue. I then went to the emergency room and where they gave me another 50 mg shot of Benadryl and a 6 mg shot of Decadron. They monitored me for a couple hours and the swelling in my mouth had gone down and the rash that had also reappeared had gone down. They sent me home with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg 4 pills a day for 4 days and told me to continue the Benadryl. I took the Prednisone and Benadryl for all day 3/21 and was feeling better. When I woke up on 3/22, my chest and arms had a rash on them. I took a Benadryl around 7:30 and Prednisone around 8:30. I went to work and around 10:30 my face started getting red and swelling again. I contacted my dermatologist who did skin patch testing and got an appoint for 3/22 at 1:45. She extended the Prednisone out to 12 days and told me to switch to Zytrec during the day and I will follow up on three weeks.

Received 2nd covid vaccination last week- mild reaction with fever thereafter.  She had w/u in the ED including an EKG with inferior and septal TWI and trop of 1.61.  CTA chest was negative.  She was admitted.  After admit, troponin trended up (1.61--3.71--4.93).  CRP 49.1, ESR 21.   Echo showed apex hypokinesis so with TWI on EKG and elevated trop, cardiology elected for LHC.  This was normal.  Cardiac MRI showed myopericarditis. She was started on high dose ASA, colchicine and bblocker for this.  Likely viral etiology (Covid, Resp 4 plex negative).  Trop trended down on 4/13 (CRP still rising).  Cardiology was ok with discharge.  Will need 2 weeks of ASA and 3 months of colchicine.  No strenuous activities for that time frame.  She is getting her Masters in music/violin and did not need a return to school note.   Feeling somewhat better at discharge- rated pain 6/10.    Internal Medicine followup in 1 week Cardiology followup in 2 months

After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

PM starting having extreme itching on dorsal sides of hands, used lotion that I normally use (sensitive skin kind) to see if it was just dryness. Red bumps still on just right hand 1/9/2021 woke up in middle of night to extreme itching and spreading red bumps on both hands. Bumps are small and fluid filled. Took Benadryl and went back to bed after washing hands. Early PM continued extreme itching and spreading bumps to wrists becoming more red and some bumps popping. Later in evening I noticed swelling starting in my hands. I have tried Benadryl cream (not difference) washing hands well (no difference) lotion (worse) hydrocortisone 1% cream (itching worse) swelling went from none to a non pitting edema. Hands hurt and swelling increasing over time more bumps showing up on hands (with no other changes to any products I have used)

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

                                                had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 24-year-old female patient (currently 25-years-old) received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 24-years-old) on 06Jan2021 12:45 at 0.3 mL, single in right deltoid for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899, expiry date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month on 09Jan2021 13:00 with outcome of not recovered. She reported, &#34;I&#39;ve had both doses of the vaccine. The last one was on 06Jan2021. I have had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month.&#34; She says she got the second dose 06Jan2021 and on 09Jan2021 she was at the doctor&#39;s office and he felt what he thought is a swollen lymph node like under her clavicle, it is the size of a golf ball now, it is not going away. She says the swollen lymph node is under the clavicle on her left side. The doctor didn&#39;t seem too concerned about it but it has been almost a month and it is still there she doesn&#39;t know what it is but it is still there. She confirms the second dose was 06Jan2021 and on 09Jan2021 her doctor noticed it was swollen, she didn&#39;t even notice it before he did. She thinks it has gotten worse but she also might be freaking out for no reason but she thinks it has gotten bigger. She says she has the information for the first dose but the second dose is on another card because she forgot the card when she went back for the second dose. The information for the second dose is at home and she is not at home right now. She does not see an NDC Number. She says the lot number information could be available later if needed for follow up because the card is at home. Dose: It is not on the card but she thinks it is 0.3 ml, she doesn&#39;t remember for sure. At the time she got the dose she was being treated for ring worm. Her doctor did draw a Calcium and a PTH and they were both normal. She says the doctor was not too concerned about but it has been almost a month and it still has not gone down (as reported). She has asthma which she has been dealing with kind of on and off because this winter has been so cold but other than that nothing else has happened, her vitals are normal she did not even have any temperature or anything after the vaccine. The event was assessed as non-serious. Vaccination Facility Type was hospital. The adverse event did not require a visit to the Emergency Room or Physician Office. It was noted while she was in the doctors office but she has not had to go back for it. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

On March 15, 2021 I started with a top left back pain (same side as injection) where is it painful to move and difficult to breathe deeply. I&#39;m not completely sure if this is related to the COVID vaccine but it is on the same side of the site of injection.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine I was lightheaded, nauseated and my tongue began to get itchy and swollen like the beginning of an anaphylactic reaction. I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care. While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

A 24-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0153), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Apr2021 at 14:00 (at the age of 24-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 diagnosis in May2020, COVID-19 test taken via nasal swab on 01May2020 was positive.  The patient had never had an allergic reaction in her life and she was not allergic to anything that she knew of. There were no concomitant medications (no medications within 2 weeks prior to vaccination). The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine.The patient received her first vaccine on 10Apr2021. After the shot she felt her throat closing. She experienced Tightening, heating up, swelling of throat and chest within 10 minutes of vaccine administration, also reported as at 14:15. They called the Paramedics, who gave her Benadryl injection when they picked her up from the site where she received her vaccination, which was a drug store. She was then transported to the emergency department. She was hospitalized and treated with Benadryl injection for the Tightening, heating up, swelling of throat and chest. She was monitored for 3-4 hours, and her symptoms were not worsening and she was able to leave the hospital. Ever since, this is the 9th day, everyday she had severe shortness of breath. She had no wheezing. Her chest clenches. It scared her so she had gone to the Emergency Department 2 more times for it. She had gone there 3 times in total. She had been to the Emergency Room a few times and saw doctors there. Her throat closing stopped later that evening and had come back about 4 times. Since then, she was not sure if it was just the sensation of the throat closing because it is coupled with shortness of breath. She had the sensation of throat closing about 4 times. She was short of breath every day since receiving the vaccine and up to 4 times each day. Sometimes it was worse than others. She had it while on the call (19Apr2021) and rated it 4/10. On 14Apr2021 she went to the Emergency Department in the middle of the night. She rated that episode as 9/10. Episodes of symptoms had been ongoing and reoccurring since the day of vaccine administration. She had a COVID-19 test post vaccination in Apr2021 (unknown results). The outcome of  Tightening/ Chest tightness, heating up, swelling of throat and chest, throat closing and severe shortness of breath was not recovered.

A 25-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 31Dec2020 09:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included biliary dyskinesia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, and cholecystectomy (gallbladder surgically removed Nov2019), irritable bowel syndrome subtype C (diagnosed Jul2020), and COVID-19 on an unspecified date prior vaccination. Concomitant medications included polyethylene glycol [macrogol] and amitriptyline. The patient experienced soreness at and around the injection site on the right upper arm on 01Jan2021 10:00; tenderness in the axillary region of the right arm on Jan2021; slight swelling in the axillary region of the right arm on Jan2021; and coughing on 01Jan2021 10:00. No therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the events. Clinical outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) and a non-contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. After a few days on 25Dec2020, patient started to experience reactions, like a tingling reaction on her arms, body, and also swelling of the face, and she also started to have headaches. It has been like that for a while, and patient who is a health care professional was brought to the emergency room, to check on what was going on, but she was not able to get the medication they need, it was twice that the consumer he tried to bring the patient to emergency, and she still hasn&#39;t gotten medication for the symptoms. She started having reactions, she had numbness in the face and tingling,  headaches, tingling in the hands and arms, and weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness, she felt like fatigue and also in the back, she had pain and soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down. She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Throat started to close up, tingling sensation throughout entire body, rush of heat, dizziness, increased heart rate. Made it back to the site (closest medical professionals near me) where my throat still felt swollen but I could breathe. Chest hurt and was still dizzy. Was given 50mg Benadryl &amp; 20mg Pepsid. It seemed to come and go in waves but I still went to the ER. ER doc said what he saw I was experiencing was anxiety. Pharmacist who had been with me the whole time could tell that my neck and throat had been swollen but had gone down with the Benadryl. ER administered anti nausea meds and a steroid shot. Also prescribed steroids for a few days. Received the shot at 6:45, initial reaction occurred around 7:10, went to the ER around 8:45

                                                Swollen lymph node (or unknown lump) behind the left collarbone; painful on it&#39;s own and painful to touch. Lymph node swelled up to about the size of a cherry and has stayed that size. Began at about 11 AM on 2/8 and has continued through now (~4 PM 2/9).   Intense muscle aches, worse two days after the vaccine, instead of just one day after. Aching of the muscles around the eyes (the ones you would use to squint and the top of the cheeks), the scalp, neck (the base of the skull and trapezius), biceps, aching around the wrist joints, hip flexors, quadriceps, and ankle joints. Found relief with 500 mg acetaminophen throughout the day.

                                                Patient developed headache, fever and extreme sweating the evening after vaccination. Also, she developed gum swelling, purple spots on the gums, sores in the mouth, and fever blisters on the lips. Symptoms worsened and patient went to the facility to get a COVID test, which was negative. Over the weekend, patient developed swollen lymph nodes/neck and also noticed a lump in the left breast (same side as vaccination). Patient was nursing 11 month old and supply diminished (never returned). Went to stat care and was diagnosed with strep throat over the weekend. About 2 weeks post-vaccinations symptoms resolved and lump in breast no longer present.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

                                                One week after receiving vaccine, this patient developed painful lumps in the left chest (side of vaccine) and left armpit. Multiple developed at different times and have increased the number since the original was discovered. Perhaps they are lymph nodes, but that has not been confirmed by a provider. They have not diminished in size or painful quality since discovery two days ago.

By 2:00pm, had slurred speech; severe fatigue; red skin on hands, face, neck; balance problems and dizziness; swollen hands. That evening through the next morning, I was experienced severe flu-like symptoms, including vertigo, extremely severe fatigue, and full-body muscle aches. My temperature was slightly elevated (98.7) from my &#34;baseline,&#34; which is around 96.7. On Saturday, I was very tired, no appetite, still experiencing some vertigo and muscle aches. Symptoms improved overnight and by Sunday evening, I was mostly back to normal, with some lingering fatigue.

                                                About 30 seconds after the injection I felt a strange sharp pain right under where the injection site was. I was advised to sit near the nurses station for 30 minutes instead of 15 due to my medical history. One of the nurses came by to check on me and as we were chatting my entire left shoulder and up my neck suddenly got red and rashy. I looked down and both of my arms were rashy as well. I began to experience itching everywhere. The nurse gave me 50 mg of benedryl and monitored me for about 40 minutes. The rash went down and they had my husband come pick me up. I called my pcp and advised them or the situation. She asked to keep her informed and if anything got worse to administer the Epi-Pen and go to the ER. Once home I slept for about 5 1/2 hours and then woke up in the afternoon. I had a minor headache and my arm had started to swell, but the rash was completely gone. As of today my arm is still red and swollen under the injection site, and itches quite a lot.

I talked to the people who were monitoring and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl and they kept me for 45- one hour. They Benadryl took about 20-30 minutes to for having the hives and irritation go away. After that happened, I went home and I started to get body aches and feeling very fatigued; a little bit nauseous.  I did have some soreness and swelling on my arm after vaccine that lasted two or three days. The fatigue and body aches lasted for one day. The hives and irritation on my throat and neck and arm didn&#39;t come back after the dose of Benadryl.  I had a doctor appt on Feb 8 about the side affects of the vaccine - he told me if hives came back to take Benadryl.

                                                Swelling and redness of the arm within an hour after the vaccine. Tingling began in middle, ring, and pinky fingers within 20 minutes of injection. Numbness began within the first hour. Within two hours, I lost strength and 60% use of my left hand. The pinky and ring finger of my left hand have been either completely numb or tingling ever since my shot over one week ago.   I noticed mild numbness about 3-4 days after the first dose, but assumed I had just slept funny. When my arm became red and hand became tingly after my second dose, I realized this was an effect of the vaccine and not merely a pinched nerve in my sleep.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 25-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: En6203), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on an unspecified date (at the age of 25-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnant. Medical history included COVID prior vaccination on unspecified date. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included unspecified birth control pills. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: En9581) in the right arm on 09Feb2021 at 02:00 PM (at the age of 25-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine in four weeks. On 21Mar2021 at 14:00 after her second vaccine the patient had an anaphylactic reaction. It was something she had eaten before so not new to her body. It happened again on 27Apr2021. Still from things she eats normally. Both occurrences happened 30 minutes after eating and came on quickly. The event resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event which included Benedryl, steroids, and given an epipen. The patient recovered from the event on unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, known drug safety profile and plausible temporal association, the causality between the suspect drug and the event cannot be excluded.
