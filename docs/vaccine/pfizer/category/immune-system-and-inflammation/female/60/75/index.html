This 60-year-old female nurse (patient) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 to 23Dec2020 at 0.3 mL single on left deltoid to prevent getting the COVID vaccine, for protection. Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed in her mid twenties, in the 80s, she had asthma when she was a child, then it stopped and resurfaced in her mid twenties, ongoing eczema diagnosed years already, a long time ago and unspecified allergies with medications.  There were no concomitant medications. She received the vaccine on 23Dec2020. She has a lot of allergies in Dec2020, and had some side effects, and she got through it ok. Her side effects were some swelling of arm, a rash developed, like 5cm x 4cm at site of injection, chills and shivers, and a bronchospasm cough on 24Dec2020. Arm swelling event started 24 hours later, no more, it was stable for 24 hours, and the 3rd day, went down, was a little raised, the next day was flat but still red. She had recovered completely. The 4th day was a good day. The patient stated she had some allergy shots she had to go through before, this was no different. Rash was no more, it was gone by 27Dec2020. She was still able to go to work. Chills and shivers started 24 hours later, and took for 48 hours intermittently, she had since recovered completely. The patient stated this was all nothing different than getting like the flu shot. Bronchospasm cough event only took another 48 hours, the difference was, even when she calls it bronchospasm, it was close to when she had an asthma attack, but no chest tightness, shortness of breath, she just would cough, spasm in Dec2020 and stop. She had recovered completely. The patient stated she had no symptoms at all before the vaccine, she was healthy, she made sure nothing was going on, that she was not tired, had no cold, she took no medications for this, as she wanted to know how her body reacted and if it can handle it. They says it was ok to take paracetamol (TYLENOL), but she did not, but the second dose she would, now that she knows and she was comfortable through it. She did have some mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores that came up in Dec2020, but nothing to run to the hospital to the doctor for. Clarifies this occured after she received the vaccine. The outcome of the event allergies, mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores were unknown. The outcome of rash at site of injection was recovered on 27Dec2020. The outcome of other events was recovered in Dec2020. The causality between Pfizer COVID vaccine with some swelling of arm, rash developed 5cm x 4cm at injection site, chills and shivers, bronchospasm cough was related (Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Global Introspection).

This 60-year-old female nurse (Patient) reported that received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation, Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune. Concomitant medications included Metoprolol at 12.5 mg for Atrial fibrillation and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN). No diabetes, no hypertension. None of the usual common diseases. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I received vaccine this past Wednesday. I was just talking to a couple of my colleagues and honestly I received the vac. at work. I did not really read through the paperwork and was &#39;weird&#39; sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday. What happened it looked like an encephalopathy but my head swelled, my face was all swollen, complete brain fog, fatigue and I couldn&#39;t talk. I was in so much pain in my head resulting in (incomplete sentence).&#34; Lab work included the only thing is the PCR swabbing. No blood test. Registered Nurse further stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know if that is important. But I will tell you and if it is you can send me the questions. I do have a history of Autoimmune. So my Physician thought that this was just like an enhancement of like my bodies reaction I have Chronic Lyme and I have lupus like my ANA has always been stressful. But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body&#39;s reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache.&#34; Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I just wanted to let you know what happened and the intensity of what it was because normally I would expect a headache. But this was a &#39;go dated&#39;. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I guess the only question that I have is so do my work has this question and I was going to call my doctor tomorrow may be might know it better. I know that I have to take the second dose. But I understand the second round can be worse than the first. Is there anything that they are recommending that I can do may be prior to ease the reaction?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported clinical manifestations including swelling face and head swelled, which was suspected as encephalopathy by the reporting nurse, was probably related to the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), due to temporal relationship.  The subject&#39;s underlying Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune were likely the risk factors to the onset of the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Swelling was the size of large lemon.  Smaller amount of swelling noticed in right armpit, also.  Vaccinations had both been done in my LEFT arm and greater swelling was in left armpit.  Had fever, chills and headache this same day requiring me to take round the clock doses of Tylenol.  By the following day, fever and chills were gone but swelling of armpit still present.  Swelling is slowly diminishing but still present by day 3, as I send this notification.

                                                At 4hrs post vaccination experienced extreme muscular pain between shoulder blades. The following week, as far as I can recall, I began to have tingling from the right shoulder blade down to my hand. I thought I may have a pinched nerve and went to the walk in clinic to be seen by the nurse practitioner that is in the same office as my primary. She examined me and thought it sounded like a pinched nerve and said I was swollen in the area of complaint. Cervical and thoracic x rays were taken (normal) and was told to take Flexeril and steroids. Pain was getting worse and primary told me to  begin taking  Meloxicam and have physical therapy. I have been doing both beginning 1-11-2021. Pain continues with no  improvement. Do not know if my symptoms are caused from the Covid shot, but just seemed to me that it was quite a coincidence that muscle pain began on the same day as receiving the shot.

I called my PCP, he told me to take Tylenol is painful and to put warm compress if they were uncomfortable. They are still there, they don&#39;t hurt or painful.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 60-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL1283, subcutaneous on 20Jan2021 15:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes, anaemia, blood pressure, cholesterol. Patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EU9899, in the left arm on 30Dec2020 15:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization and experienced swelling and redness at the site. Concomitant medications included liraglutide (VICTOZA), labetalol (LABETALOL), diltiazem (DILTIAZEM), valsartan (DIOVAN), rosuvastatin, metformin, aspirin and iron. The patient thinks that it wasn&#39;t given to her intramuscularly. This is a potential inadvertent subcutaneous administration of the BNT162B2. This patient received her second dose on 20Jan2021 on the side of her arm and reported that it was swollen, red, and hot, but has gotten 100 times better&#39; over the last 6 days since administration. She was asking for efficacy of the incorrectly administered dose. It was further stated that in the middle of the night, her arm was red almost like a little bullseye and she said that she was getting burning, and pins and needles down her arm, and a fullness in her hand like her hand was swollen. She said that she still kind of feels it. As the days progressed on day 2, 3, and 4, the swelling got more intense, the circular red swollen area got worse to the size of like a small baseball. She was feeling okay other than that. Today was day 6 and it was not as red and was more black and blue, swelling went down 80 percent, she still feels a little bit of the pins and needles and the fullness in her hand. She said that there was like a big knot that was very hot. It was a hard like knot at the injection site. The injection site was really big, round, hot, red, and had a knot that lasted; adds it is still there but 99% better; and she had tingling down her arm with pins and needles in her hand. She noticed it was little red a couple of hours, like 8 hours later; but by the next day it was circular, more red, swollen, itchy, and burning down her arm. By the third day, the site had a big, red, hard knot; still burning down her arm and with pins and needles down her arm. She added that her hand felt like a fullness in her hand filled with fluid. By Friday the swelling at the site was gigantic. The site swelling is improved but the redness was more of a black and blue now. Her arm has been very dark red, discolored, swollen, painful and has nerve pain described as &#34;hot tingling down the arm like pins and needles&#34; to her hand. She states that she has a very large knot at the injection site. This was in her non-dominant arm. She spoke with two of the pharmacists that she works with and they looked at her arm and both felt like she may have received the injection subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. The outcome of events was not recovered. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information on the batch/lot number has been obtained.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 60-year-old female patient started to receive bnt162b2 (manufacturer unspecified), lot number: EL4238, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 21Jan2021 15:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis. Patient&#39;s known allergies are Penicillin, Peanut and Dairy. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient&#39;s whole/entire arm was killing her; she was hurting across her shoulder blades down to fingers. Her elbow and wrist were hot and she was feeling a tremble in hand which she has never had before. She later added that her joint in elbow and shoulder was now reaching down to her arm. She couldn&#39;t even wear her watch today to her work, it felt swollen, like there was liquid in it. She also can&#39;t lift her arm, move and the pain was like going into her back. The patient was taking Aleve and Advil and &#34;it doesn&#39;t take away all but it takes away enough that she can function.&#34; She also bought a topical ointment to help numb the area and she was wearing a pain patch on my back. The outcome of events was reported as &#39;not recovered&#39;. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information on the batch/lot number has been obtained.

Was swollen for 5 days, then fever chills, body aches (fever 0f 100.2)  Right hand was so painful was intolerable, truly had to wait for it to pass, nothing helped except for soaking in Epsom salt bath, which was short live.  Have had arthritis in this thumb but not for approximately 8 years.  Entire hand was swollen and not useable.

By 2/10/21 in the morning both elbows, knees and wrists were sore. Elbows and right knee felt warm to the touch. Nodules or red spots developed around the joints. I could barely walk or climb in and out of the car, the bed, and had a very difficult time standing up from the toilet or a low chair or couch. No fever, but did have a few chills with teeth chattering at least twice.

                                                Received Pfizer COVID19 injection at 9:57 am on March 4 at the . As is usual for any shot or IV on me, I immediately tasted something weird in my mouth. It was not as metallic tasting as usual. More plasticy. Shot did not hurt.   Was told to stay in 30 minutes waiting area.I did. The taste remained in my mouth. I left at 10:34 am feeling OK, except for weird taste.  As I drove off the parking lot, I noticed that my mouth and tongue were tingling, with worst of it on my left side.  My throat did not seem to be affected, so I continued driving. Some nasal congestion and coughing.  The tingling turned into numbness in my mouth and tongue, all the way back to top of throat.  I called my primary care doctor at 12:10 pm and left a message.  I received a call back at 2:15 pm from nurse. She told me to take Benadryl and have someone take me to Urgent Care right away to get my vitals checked. I did not take Benadryl, as CDC said it could mask anaphylactic reaction.  I called a friend and she took me . I noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were swelling and painful.  We arrived at 2:45 pm. My vitals were checked, heart and breathing listened to and was checked briefly  for swelling in mouth and throat. There was no swelling. He said he had never heard of this tingling reaction and claimed it is just a side effect and not a serious reaction and that it would probably last a couple of days. He recommended that I watch for new symptoms and take Benadryl. That was $30. We left at 3:10.  We left. I noticed that the numbness was spreading to my lips and up the left side of face and I was getting super tired. Also, my mid to lower back started hurting a lot. I took a Benadryl.  4:30 pm still have same numbness. My eyes got super dry and itchy. My head started to hurt. Some coughing.  5:10 pm dry eye and numbness, more swollen lymph nodes and chills.

                                                On  the day of the shot, by Noon I could feel the vaccine moving into my throat and my  face. My throat and left cheek started to swell and turn slightly red.  I took more Benadryl and called my allergist in the afternoon. They told me I needed to get to the hospital for treatment.  At the hospital, they gave me steriods, benadryl and Pepcid in an IV.  After allowing this to work, they sent me home with a  steriod prescription for 60Mg for the next 5 days.  They asked me to follow up with my allergist if I had other issues , they also told me that I would not be able to get the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  Over the next several days, I continued to have issues with this redness that had grown over my entire face. I looked like I was totally sunburned.  I did not feel well, the redness was very hot, and I struggled with some breathing. I made an appointment on  Monday morning with my allergist, and they adjusted my allergy medicine and gave me more asteroids for 5 more days.   They advised me to use my nebulizer treatments as needed to remove the heaviness in my chest. This redness and swelling has moved around my body, almost as if I can see where the vaccine is at in my body.  It went from my head to my chest/back and right arm. Down to my abdomen, and then down below my knees.  In the morning, it is usually in my face and then it moves around during the day.  I can feel this fluid moving around in my body because the redness brings swelling/fluid.  This last saturday 3/6/2021 was horrible, it was in my right ear and right foot.  It was very painful and made me very dizzy. I struggled to walk.  Then on Sunday morning, I felt fine all day.  Today Monday, it feels like it is in my right foot again, but I feel like It is  getting better.

                                                This patient was vaccinated approximately 1 hour prior to presentation here with her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She felt fine right after her vaccination but as she drove to her destination where she was going to take a walk, she started to develop left-sided facial burning and swelling.  That prompted her to call her PCP in that office recommended she come back to the vaccination clinic to be evaluated.   I evaluated her at approximately 2 PM.. She was feeling well for the most part with the exception of left-sided facial burning and swelling and a little bit of redness over her left cheek.  She denied fevers, chills, itching, other areas of rash, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, tongue swelling, lip swelling, wheezing, chest pain, or difficulty breathing.   She recalls a penicillin allergy at age 5 or 6 but cannot remember the reaction. She has never reacted to a vaccine before.   Initial vital signs included a blood pressure of 134/73, a pulse that was 70 and regular, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She had normal mental status and her lungs were clear. The left side of her face was slightly swollen over her left cheek as compared to the right with some slight increased flushing on the left side. There was no stridor, she was speaking comfortably, and her lungs were clear with good airflow. Her heart demonstrated S1 and S2 with regular rate and rhythm.   I administered 2 doses of Benadryl, 25 mg with each dose about 15 minutes apart with her last dose at approximately 2:25 PM.   I rechecked her vital signs at 2:50 PM and her blood pressure was 138/79 with a pulse of 70 and regular and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Her lungs were clear and she was moving good air. I did take a relook at her face which was improved with decreased swelling.   At 3 PM, because she was doing much better, I discharged her to home with instructions to use Benadryl 50 mg when she got home and then 25 to 50 mg every 4 hours today. If she develops any respiratory symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, cough, breathing difficulty, swollen tongue or swollen lips, as well as increased facial swelling, she will call 911 to be evaluated.   She should not get the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

A tingling feeling up my left arm to back of my neck. My neck stiffened and then my throat started to close.  Not to where I can&#39;t swallow but just like when I eat food that I&#39;m allergic too, it closes up. The nurse that was overseeing me was holding the umbrella over my car window with the rainfall.  All of a sudden their was lightning &amp; thunder. The nurse threw the umbrella because she was shocked from the lightning. She started to talk to all the other around her and forgot about me. Since I could still swallow I didn&#39;t get her attention. When she returned she asked me the time so I had to pull my phone out. She didn&#39;t know the time of my 15 minutes and sent me away. As soon as I got out of the parking area but still inside amusement park, I started to feel my cheeks becoming numb and my right eye was blurry.  I quickly moved over to the side lane still inside of amusement park and waited.  I called my husband and told him that with the heavy rain I didn&#39;t feel safe driving with my right eye being blurry.  I waiting another 15 minutes before driving home.  That evening the blurriness came back, my eye&#39;s &amp; forehead was tender to touch but no headache.  Only pressure in my head.  My symptoms of closed throat, swollen cheeks, pressure in my head and blurriness continued on Friday, March 12th, Saturday, March 13th, Sunday, March 14th and Monday, March 15th.  As of today, no other systems other than feeling my body has inflammation.

Took Tylenol but it gradually rose to 102.3. Took 3 hours for fever to go down. By 5:30 fever was gone &amp; I was feeling better. Next day I felt great but by three days later I had a fever blister &amp; very sore, dry and stuffy nose which lasted two weeks. And headache as well. I?m thinking because of stuffy nose. I did have Covid last March/April 2020 so I have heard that I would have side effects.

                                                I was submitting my events daily on website and two days it tells me my session has expired and won&#39;t let me report anything.  On Sunday night, March 21st, I started with very painful joint and muscle aches with fatigue.  The next morning I felt terrible and could barely function, I had a bought with diarrhea that lasted almost the entire day and had no energy.  I developed a large lump on my left clavicle area that seemed to be filled with fluid.  My knees I had replaced are still very painful today ( 7 days post vaccine).  I phoned my Dr. yesterday and they told me to take 1000mg of Tylenol 3 times a day.  I am doing this now for the second day with some relief.  I feel this is very unusual to feel this way 7 days after the vaccine.  On day 1-2 the only symptoms were a sore arm from the vaccine.  Saturday was actually a good day with no symptoms, the other symptoms started on Sunday.  I feel like my heartbeat is irregular also but my BP is good.  I would like to be able to to report daily on v-safe like I was the first few days.

Being an MD ( anesthesiologist), I examined the lump and felt like a size of a walnut in a shell. I immediately called my Primary and I went to his office. We discussed about my Covid vaccine. And he requested Chest X-ray. In the future, head and neck CT.

A 60-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 17:30 (at the age of 60years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. There was no medical history; no known allergies. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (VITA D); ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C); fish oil; ubidecarenone (COQ10); magnesium; and zinc; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that her lymph nodes swelled on the same side where she received the shot. Also, the left side of her checks down to neck and shoulders felt weird, she can&#39;t quite explain the feeling; she thought she was getting Bell&#39;s Palsy which is one of the adverse reactions. She was alarmed as she was unaware of the swelling of the lymph nodes. The adverse events occurred on 19Mar2021 (16:30). There was no treatment received for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of events was recovering.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

After dinner, around 7:30pm I noticed that my lips were swollen and the rash was spreading. Took one Benadryl and waited 1 hour. Condition worsened so left for ER around 8:45pm. Once there, I was diagnosed with an anaphylatic reaction. I was given Prednisone, Pepcid and Benadryl intervaneously. The Benadryl injection caused my throat to close for a few seconds. Things calmed down so we waited an hour to see if I was responding. There was not a lot of improvement so ER doctor decided to use Epinephrine (EP pen injection). After 2 hours of observation, I was set home to follow up with primary care physcian.

Patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 vaccine, Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, NDC number: Unknown, Expiry Date: Unknown) on 08Feb2021 with no reaction. She worked for a health agency and the whole office went and got it. Caller provided that her sister had a reaction the first time, on 03Apr2021, where her sister woke up with itching started in her hands and ended up migrating to her whole body. By morning patient&#39;s tongue had swelled up, couldn&#39;t swallow and her voice was scratchy, like the caller couldn&#39;t understand her sister&#39;s speech well. Caller provided that her sister went to the ER and said there was a whole team giving her urgent care, medication, and such. Caller reported that her sister said the ER didn&#39;t find anything in her bloodwork, and the caller did not think the patient was being treated for any other medical conditions, and caller did not think her sister is on any medications, but caller said to not quote her on that. Caller knew her sister had a weight problem, but she did not know if her sister needed blood pressure medication or anything. Caller reported her sister said that the bloodwork from the ER did not find any-thing, and the patient was not admitted to the hospital. Caller reported that at this time, her sister&#39;s adverse events were no longer ongoing as her sister was given Steroids, like Prednisone, Benadryl and Famotidine, and she took those products as recommended by the doctor. Caller did not know the end date of her sister&#39;s events; all she knew was that the reaction initially started on 03Apr2021. Caller stated that her sister was allergic to nothing, and she has never had incidences of itching like that, where the itching was so bad that she was stripping down and the patient&#39;s daughter was patting the patient down with witch hazel. Caller stated that ER released the patient and gave her some medications and such. Caller stated that a day or so later, there was a second round of reaction: the right side of the patient&#39;s face swelled up and numb and her lips were numb, like when people have a dental procedure. Lips were numb for a while. Upon completion of the medications she was given, the reactions stopped. Patient regularly saw the family doctor. She would go back to see her Doctor on Thursday.

Caller does not have card with her at time of call for LOT, NDC, Expiry date. Caller stated that she knew that all the COVID vaccines are just in the Emergency Use Authorization stage and in clinical trials, but caller really thought that all manufacturers should be advertising that they would like feedback from patients. Caller has not heard anything from any of the manufacturers saying that people are welcome to reach out and report side effects. Caller states that she only knew to call because she used to be a Home Health Worker, and she thought this is an important data. Caller has never seen on any of her 19 TV channels about calling to report. Caller stated that the girl who first answered her call, read a clinical data sheet about joint pain being seen in 23% of patient&#39;s and not knowing a percentage for anaphylactic reactions, caller was wondering if this was true. Caller verified that she just wanted to ask basically that patient was not alone, if other people might have had that happen too. Caller stated that she tried to call, and it would ask another question and it would say press 1 or 2, then it would ask other questions and it would say press 1 or 2, she never got an option 3. Caller asked: how much percentage, has anyone reported this side effects weeks after the second dose. Caller was wondering if this reaction could have been from the vaccine. Investigation Assessment: No. The outcome of the events were unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Apr2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: EW0ISO) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included she had lupus, sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications not reported. The patient previously took Pneumonia Vaccine on 04Mar2021 (Anatomical Location: Left arm); took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 at 10:00 (at age of 60 years old, Lot Number: the lot number starts with ER something and then it ends with a 3) as single dose for covid-19 immunization; took azathioprine for lupus and had allergic reaction; took belimumab (BENLYSTA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Lot Number: PV7G; Expiration Date: Jun2023, NDC: 49401-088-01, Number on the side: 0147098) to an unspecified date, self injection once a week for lupus. She gets it through the VA and it is subcutaneous use and the manufacturer is company. she was immunocompromise, she had lupus, so she was off of her medication (BENLYSTA) for a month per the CDC guidelines. She wanted to let Pfizer know that as well. For her first COVID vaccine she was originally scheduled to go 6 to 7 days after she had her pneumonia shot and they told her that she would have to wait 2 weeks before having her COVID shot and she did. Other than that she had followed the guidelines and she had been able to take her regular medications but she had to stop her Benlysta because of her immune system and everything. She had been following through on what the CDC has said. Patient stated that she just did a follow up with her doctor because of what happened after her second Pfizer COVID vaccine and her doctor recommended her to let Pfizer know about the side effects that she was having. On Friday 16Apr2021 she had her shot at 10 AM and it was no big deal, it was a little warm on her arms. She stated that it just looked like a bee sting and it wasn&#39;t super sore, it was warm to the touch and sensitive to the touch. It had big red spots and there has really been no change since it began. It looks about the size of a bee sting and it was still there. She had a little tiredness and she was not hungry but when she woke up at 06:40 the next morning (17Apr2021) on Saturday she was having severe dry heaves and vomiting bile and she could not get it under control. It had dehydrated her and she was having severe muscles aches. She had the severe dry heaves and the vomiting that lead to dehydration and then she went to the emergency room and she got replenished and they had given her something for feeling nauseous and eventually she was released 3 to 4 hours later. They gave her pills as well so she was doing well now and she hasn&#39;t done anything since she went to the emergency room with the vomiting and feeling nauseous. She went there about 1030 to 1040. Before she went she couldn&#39;t stop and she told herself that if it didn&#39;t stop on the 5th time then she was going to go to the emergency room and it got really bad so she had to call 911 to come and get her. Then she was having severe diarrhea on Sunday (18Apr2021) and the only way she could stop that was for her husband to pick up antidiarrheal pills. That only went away because of the medicine from the pharmacy. She had the over the counter medicine and she took Imodium. She hasn&#39;t been eating a lot so she hasn&#39;t had a bowel movement since she took that medication. When she had diarrhea there was no substance, it was very watery. And now today (unspecified date) she was having another reaction that she was seeing and it was just itching on her hands and her feet. She had been continuing to take the Benadryl and something that they gave her in the emergency room and she had taken Tylenol for the little headache that she has had. She had a slight headache and she was still taking Tylenol like they had recommended. This began the same time as she was vomiting on 17Apr2021 when she was going through all of that she had the slight headache. But her biggest concern was during this time when initially on Saturday (17Apr2021), her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, she was having the dry heaves her airway closed shut and she couldn&#39;t swallow to get any fluids in. Her concern was that the back of her throat was killing her and it was totally closed up so she had to go to the emergency room. She had recognized this because in the past she has had a medication where she had an allergic reaction (she thinks it is the medication that they gave her for lupus because she has been on several different things. She thinks azathioprine but she can&#39;t recall exactly but she thinks that might of been the one that did it to her) and it had closed her esophagus up the same way like this. This time it got worse to where she couldn&#39;t even swallow water no less a pill. This was on 17Apr2021. When she went to the emergency room they gave her the hydrocortisone to take it down and she actually had felt better while she was waiting for the saline drop. She was able to swallow when her airway was opened again by the time they treated it with the hydrocortisone. Around 16:00 she was better when she left the emergency room that same day 17Apr2021. She doesn&#39;t really have a sore throat, it is pretty fine. It seems to be okay she thinks that once the dry heaves and all that stopped it helped to relax that. She was a little raspy from the whole thing and she was struggling with having a dry mouth but that even had been resolved as far as her throat. She had no other reactions than what she explain but she also had a lot of muscles pain but that was to be excepted because it says that on all that she has read. She had had all of the reactions listed except for fever. She had had chills and then when clammy and then was clammy and had chills. She had all of those side effects listed on the sheet and when she went on Saturday following her vaccine to the emergency room most of the side effects were treated in emergency room. They gave her Pepcid, hydrocortisone through her IV and gave her Zofran for the vomiting and they said to keep taking acetaminophen. They gave her cetirizine for allergy or the itching or whatever and they also gave her famotidine which she thinks is Pepcid. Since being off the lupus drug she was getting her symptoms again such as sensitivity to light, inflammation and the dry heaves didn&#39;t help so under her eyes it was swollen and she just takes it as it was because she was not on her medication and she had something else injected inside of her. Also, she had Sjogren&#39;s disease too so her eyes were already drier than normal and she had had puffiness since 17Apr2021 when she was vomiting. She just wanted to make sure that Pfizer got that information because she didn t see that listed. The only side effect she was related was the swollen glands and she has glands in her throat but she wanted to be sure that Pfizer had that data just in case if it could help someone else. Again, she wants to reiterate that with her first dosage she had no problems. She couldn t even see the mark and all of this is stemming from the second dose of the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#34;Dry heaves, Bilious vomiting, Dehydration, Her throat closing up and it being sore from vomiting and dry heaving, Unable to swallow, Dry mouth, Nauseous&#34; was recovered on 17Apr2021. The outcome of events &#34;Feeling of warmth, Vaccination site pain, Hyperaesthesia, Vaccination site erythema, Tiredness&#34; not recovered. The outcome of the event &#34;Headache&#34; was recovering. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 03Feb2021 17:40 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269) as single dose at the age of 60-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation, offered at the health system she works for and administered at hospital.  Medical history included ongoing acoustic neuroma on 8th cranial nerve left side, on the side she felt the intense ear pain, diagnosed 2007-2008, thyroid cancer from 2004 and thyroid removed, her hormone levels are normal, COVID-19 in Dec2020. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect.  No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced I feel pretty awful in Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, ear pain on 03Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, sense of fullness in ears and lymph nodes on 03Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 05Feb2021, body aches on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, headache on 04Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, sleepiness on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, fatigue on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, chills on 04Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, body temperature: 97.5-98.7 on 04Feb2021 with outcome of unknown. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The course of events was as follows: Patient expected that since she just had COVID in Dec2020, she thought her response to the vaccine would not be severe because she already had some immunity from the infection. The evening of the vaccine, on 03Feb2021, she experienced ear pain and a sense of fullness in her ears and lymph nodes. The ear pain was almost immediate after vaccination. On 04Feb2021, the next day, she woke up with a headache. It was an unusual headache. It did not go away with Tylenol. Then about halfway through the day, she developed significant body aches like when she had COVID. She also experienced extreme sleepiness like when she had COVID too. She took Motrin and had to lie down during her work day. The Motrin did help. Then mid morning 04Feb2021, she got a chill. She couldn&#39;t get warm enough. She had no fever. She checked multiple times. Her temps ranged from 97.5-98.7 on 04Feb2021. She experienced fatigue. She did not know the seriousness for any of the side effects she experienced. As of 05Feb2021, her headache has improved. She was still experiencing sleepiness and fatigue. The chills she developed mid day. She had not them right now. She has better and worse moments just like when she had COVID. She was worried about the second one. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 97.5-98.7 on 04Feb2021, COVID-19: positive in Dec2020. No other relevant tests. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headache and sleepiness. A Product Complaint was filed.

A 61-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EH9899), intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 12:30 to at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization in hospital. Medical history included crohn&#39;s disease. No known allergies. Concomitant medications within 2 weeks of vaccination included estradiol, progesterone, colestipol hydrochloride (COLESTID), ustekinumab (STELARA), cyanocobalamin (B12).

The patient experienced small bowel obstruction with diffuse bowel and pelvic lymphadenopathy 36 hours after injection on 22Dec2020 22:00 with outcome of recovered in Dec2020. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization for 3 days. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of event included inpatient observation, nothing by mouth (reported as NPO), intravenous fluids. No COVID prior vaccination, COVID test nasal swab was negative on 23Dec2020 post vaccination. It was not reported as serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that reported events small bowel obstruction and lymphadenopathy are related to BNT162B2 vaccine.  The patient had underlying Crohn&#39;s disease, which put patient at risk of developing the event.

A 61-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 12:12 at SINGLE DOSE at right arm for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included SVT this was recognized at least 20 years ago, around the age of 30, she started to deal with high blood pressure, allergic to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took codeine, levothyroxine: allergic to codeine, levothyroxine. The patient also previously took Tylenol with Codeine and that was horrible and she can&#39;t ever take it again, when she was around the age of 40 years old. The patient received the COVID vaccination around Wednesday 30Dec2020 at 12:12 p.m. She was perfectly fine until late Thursday afternoon 31Dec2020, around 3:30-4:00 pm. She started to have swollen lymph nodes. It was only a little bad at first and then she started getting more and more swelling. She spoke with her facility&#39;s RN who suggested she use some cold and warm packs/compresses and also take some Tylenol to deal with it. She has had the swelling for this many days now. It&#39;s not bad swelling but she her lymph nodes are still so swollen. She thought it was a regular reaction, but now it&#39;s been too long. Her lymph nodes are not swollen humongous. There is no redness. Her lymph nodes are not hard, just swollen. The swelling was a little bit better on Friday and Saturday but yesterday, it started bothering her again. She has had pain in her whole arm on an unspecified date. On 03Jan2020, her face also started to feel funny. She clarifies by &#34;feeling funny&#34;, she meant she started to experience numbness in her right cheek, only her cheek, like when one gets a vaccination when they go to a doctor&#39;s office/dentist office and it starts working and one can feel it getting numb. She also experienced numbness in her arm. She clarifies when she puts pressure on her arm (like putting her arm on the desk), she feels numb in her hand. She verifies the numbness in both her cheek and arm started occurring on 03Jan2020 around 7-8pm. She is fine today and then she&#39;ll start to feel the numbness again in her cheek and arm. She clarifies the numbness comes and goes. It comes in the morning and then goes away and then the numbness starts again. She started to feel numb in her face and cheek, like when one gets a Novocain at the dentist office and it starts working- it&#39;s like the same feeling. The outcome of the events Swollen lymph nodes and numbness in right cheek/numbness in arm/hand was not recovered, while unknown for the other event.   Information on the lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                fever; nausea; general feeling of unwell; soreness at site; redness; whole upper arm was swollen after the injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient, Respiratory Therapist) reported that a 61-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE , Batch/lot number: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 around 6:00 PM in left upper arm at 0.3mL single dose for COVID Prevention. The patient&#39;s medical history was covid at the end of Apr/May2020 with shortness of breath, seasonal allergies and allergies to &#34;some anitbiotics.&#34; The concomitant medications was reported as none, received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced soreness at site, redness and swelling, fever, nausea, general feeling of unwell 3 days. Patient stated, &#34;I had covid at the end of April/May with shortness of breath. I thought I would have less reaction from the vaccine. I know someone who was out of work for a while week after the vaccine.&#34; States that she read that the 2nd dose is supposed to have worse side effects than the first. If she had bad side effects from the 1st dose, will the 2nd be worse? Also asking if the side effects are the immune system reacting or just an allergic reaction. Patient was anxious about getting her second COVID shot on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that she had all the side effects listed, for three days. Patient stated that she didn&#39;t mind the side effects at the time, she had fever, soreness at the injection site, nausea, and a general feeling of unwell, but Patient stated that she could not work like that. Patient stated that her question was, statistically she has read that the side effects from the second shot are supposed to be worse than the first shot, but she was wondering, if she had bad side effects from the first shot, will her side effects be worse after the second, or will they maybe be lessened because she already had bad side effects. Patient reported that she did fill out the VSafe significant because she had to work on the third day after her shot, which was Christmas Eve, and work, was so busy and she did not feel well. Patient stated that she does have two days scheduled off work after her next injection, but it is the third day that she was worried about because she does not want to work feeling like that. Patient stated that the arm soreness started that same day (21Dec2020). At first, Patient reported that the arm soreness resolved, but then she states that it is still a little sore to the touch. So Patient confirmed that it is ongoing but improved. Patient reportsed that the fever started the day after the injection, 22Dec2020 and it has resolved. Patient reported that the last day she recorded a fever was on 24Dec2020. Patient  stated that she woke up on 24Dec2020 and her temperature was normal, so she went to work and she did not feel so well at work, but they were so busy that she barely noticed, and then when the Patient  went home that night, she took her temperature and it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Patient reported that the nausea started on 22Dec2020, which was mild at times, but then she got to where she did not want to eat. Patient reported that the nausea has resolved but she was not entirely sure when it resolved because she had been so busy at work on 24Dec2020, and it was hard to tell what she was feeling because she was non-stop busy that day. Patient stated that she was nauseous for a full three days, and she remembered that she did not eat much on the 24th either. So Patient stated that her nausea may have resolved on the third day after her injection, but it is unknown to her what day exactly that it resolved. Patient was also experiencing the general feeling of unwell from 22Dec2020 for a few days, but stated that by 25Dec2020 she felt okay. Patient also included that her left arm was also swollen, like her whole upper arm was swollen after the injection in Dec2020. Patient stated that she also experienced redness, there was a like a red mark that was further down her arm than the injection site in Dec2020. The outcome of soreness at site was recovering.  Patient confirmed that both the swelling and redness had resolved in Dec2020.The outcome of fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The outcome of general feeling of unwell and nausea was recovered on 25Dec2020.

                                                Monday afternoon, January 25, I started feeling achy and chilly.  Just not well.  I work 5 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.  I went straight home from work.  I took shoes off and got in bed.  I was very cold and felt that the coldness was from inside out especially in my hands.  I covered with a sheet and 3 blankets with an extra blanket to my feet and used winter gloves on my hands.  I got up at 5 p.m and felt better.   Tuesday morning, January 26 at 3 a.m. when I got up to shower,  I noticed a soreness and large swelling under left armpit, ? lymphadenopathy.  All others symptoms had passed.  Continues to be the same on today, January 27.  Seeing MD on Thursday, January 28.

A 61-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 18Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been otherwise well prior to receiving the bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020. Within 72 hours, she experienced fatigue, body aches, chills and sweats since 21Dec2020, though she was able to work Xmas week. On 31Dec2020, she contacted her PCP to report neck and leg muscle stiffness and pain, difficulty ambulating, fatigue, chills and sweats. She had a negative COVID test on 02Jan2021 and essentially negative blood work, other than an ESR of 124 mm/hr and CRP of 4 mg/dl. I had a negative PET scan on 12Jan2021. Currently, she had pain/stiffness in her neck and legs, and progressive difficulty w/ ambulation (both of which are worst in the early hours of the AM), and difficulty with ADLs since 31Dec2020. She had been unable to work since 03Jan2021. Her physician had not indicated or endorsed any relationship between her symptoms and the vax. She forewent dose 2 out of an abundance of caution. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events muscle stiffness , neck pain and gait disturbance appeared 13 days after administration of single dose BNT162B2. The Company considers that the events are less likely related to suspect BNT162B2 injection given the weak time association. The detailed clinical course and cause of the events would be helpful for further assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Getting my 2nd dose today. I have paperwork from Pfizer that I need to fill out for their data keeping.  Pain was excruciating for nearly 2wks and started to settle down a few days ago, where I don?t have to sit with a heating pad or take motrin and flexaril.  f/u 1/28/21-&#34;My neck still hurts, worse on certain days, but is bearable. I haven?t had any imaging done and just heard of another person with same symptoms. My 2nd dose was fine. No pain at all, not even at injection site. I will keep you posted if anything changes. I?m hoping it will just go away on it?s own. I?ve heard it takes months&#34;.  Referred employee back to PCP.

                                                facial flushing for 1 hour after shot. Redness on nose and cheeks for about an hour. No hives, no itching. Didn&#39;t notice until I left the vaccine site and was on the way home in car because covered by mask. Note I am a very fair skin, freckled red haired woman. I was very, very nervous and had gotten myself to the point of tears. Perhaps the flushing was from that. Have had similar flushing when drinking red wine.  Swelling in lymph node in supraclavicular area on same side as shot. Has happened with Flu shot once. Slight fever for a short period of time and fatigue. I continue to have slight shortness of breath from having covid on. 4/3/20. Nothing different.

                                                61 yo F with history of bilateral lung transplant 6/23/17 presented to ED on 2/4/21 with chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath, nausea and diarrhea for past week since receiving since receiving COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 1/28/21. Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 09:00 (at the age of 61-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced numbness in her lips, swelling in her face, her tongue was feeling funny, her throat was feeling strange, she had itchiness to her right hand, and started to develop hives on 01Feb2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: Approximately 3 hours after receiving the vaccine, the patient started to experience numbness in her lips, swelling in her face, her tongue was feeling funny, her throat was feeling strange, and she had itchiness to her right hand and started to develop hives. The patient stated that she cannot take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), but she did take cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) to help with the symptoms. The patient was still having symptoms at the time of reporting. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all of the events as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of numbness in her lips, swelling in her face, her tongue was feeling funny, her throat was feeling strange, she had itchiness to her right hand, and started to develop hives was not recovered.   The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

I looked in the mirror and could see the left lower part of my face (lower cheek by the edge of my mouth) swell and my right upper lip started to swell. I took a Benadryl (25mg oral tablet) and my roommate drove me to the Emergency Room. That area of my face continued to swell and impacted my lower lip as well. My lips were numb and tingling and I could feel my cheek swell more inside my mouth as it was touching my teeth. I was monitored (vital signs and pulse ox) for 90 minutes and received 20 mg of pepcid oral tablet and 10 mg dexamethasone oral tablet- both 1x only.

Extreme widespread stiffness, pain, joint swelling and heat, muscle weakness and pain. I also had swollen lower lip and have had an increase in headaches and nausea. Two weeks after the injection I awoke with my right arm swollen, hard, and itchy. The arm and my lips have resolved, but I am still having all the other problems. I have reported these symptoms to both my primary doctor and my rheumatologist.

It felt like the stiffness was creeping up my neck. After about a hour I felt my ear lobes tingling and the left side of my face in the jaw area  seemed a bit swollen and felt a little numb. It resolved and I had only a sore injection site the next day and no other symptoms. I&#39;m wondering if I should be concerned about getting the second shot

Will break out in different areas on arms from day to day. Abdominal rash remains constant.  Started using OTC cortisone to minimize the itch and started taking Zyrtec for the itch. It still remains as of this report and hasn&#39;t gotten any better.

                                                Around 11, 11:30 the pain woke me up because it was so bad. It was hot and there was a big lump under my left arm pit (was very tender). I did not go to sleep like that. I did not have any symptoms by the time I went to bed. I also felt hot, and then cold, then hot, then cold, I would feel too hot and then too cold, freezing, I could not keep my temperature under control. I had to call in at work during the weekend I was feeling so bad. I had a lump under my armpit the size of a fist and I could not close my arm completely. It was huge and painful. I decided to go to a clinic over the weekend (unsure if Saturday or Sunday) to seek medical care and they ran some labs and a CBC to check for infection.  All results came well no infection. They suggest to keep taking Tylenol. By Monday or Tuesday I started feeling well enough to return to work. The lump was still present and took about a week to go down. The injection site also was sore for a while, about a week also like the lump.

I left the clinic and got in the car to drive home and felt a weird feeling in my throat reminiscent of my esophageal spasm and then it felt like someone had their hand on my throat squeezing my throat and felt like I needed to take deep breaths to expand my lungs. Within a minute or two at most, my lips, tip of my tongue, tip of my nose and face beside my lips and under my cheeks started to tingle and go numb.  My insides felt swollen.   I had a doctors appointment and went there after picking my son up at home.  I reported my feeling to my doctor who prescribed a steroid for 3 days and told me to also take Benadryl or Claritin, which I did. However, today is day 4 after my vaccine and today is the first day my insides don?t hurt.

My arm was not sore but that muscle was.  That seemed to calm it down (Advil). The next morning, I was very swollen under my right armpit - I figured it was my lymph node. It was uncomfortable and very noticeable - quite swollen for three days. It took about a week to go back to normal. I also had abnormal fatigue and that took longer to resolve - that took about two weeks to be resolved.

She is inquiring if the side effects that she is experiencing are common side effects and if it is ok to get 2nd shot.  Her second vaccine is scheduled for 17Mar2021.  She stated that she wanted to take the time to make a report as she is allergic to medications. While inquiring about dates of vaccines and side effects, she stated that she was experiencing tightening of chest every so often.

She is unable to concentrate (unspecified date) and she has been experiencing headaches, experiencing them twice in 2 weeks.  She also reported that she has been having upper abdominal pain radiating to her back. This concerns her, every time she gets it, it scares her. She had pancreatitis when she was 36. It is a nightmare thought. Does this sound like maybe she is possibly starting Diabetes? She reported that this shot has triggered everything. She has an old injury in her right arm. Her arm is killing her, her hands are swelled up, she has acid reflux again, she felt terrible. She stated that the dizziness not as strong as it was at the beginning. The fatigue it comes and goes and that she has spurts where she is energetic.  She stated that it&#39;s more on than off. She is no longer having stomach aches. She compared the pain to pains of constipation. She also stated that she was constipated after receiving the vaccine on unspecified date. She had nausea at the beginning. The tightening of chest happened off and on, the last day that she experienced tightening of chest was on Sunday. For acid reflux, she is taking Zegerid as treatment, 20mg 20 mg capsules by mouth once daily as needed. She started this on 02Mar2021. She experienced upper abdominal pain yesterday and some this morning, but it was mostly in her back this morning. Her Sweating is off and on. She experienced headache just a couple of times but that she has not had one in a while.  She stated that they lasted only an hour or two, and that she does not usually get headaches. She suggested that these may be due to sinuses and weather change. She has been taking Ibuprofen twice a day as treatment. But she normally takes Ibuprofen for chronic pain. Supposed to be 3 times a day but she does not want to take that much. She stated that all of this could also be stress related and that this could also be menopause. The patient recovered from stomach aches on 02Mar2021. The outcome of the events dizzy, sweating, tightening of chest every so often, upper abdominal pain radiating to back, headache was recovering; the outcome of stomach feels odd, hot flashes, severe fatigue, acid reflux was not recovered.

                                                On 3/22/21 I experienced several bouts of diarrhea coupled with clammyness/sweating/heart rate of 102. On 3/22/21 and continue to have swelling in my left armpit (Lymph node area), spasms in my left shoulder blade and surrounding soft tissue adjacent to my left armpit and neck area.  I have experienced soreness in that arm/shoulder but not at the injection site - overall bicep and clavicle area. I have been able to alleviate symptoms to a degree by taking a tylenol once or twice a day but the pain is limiting some of my daily activities to a degree.

After she received her vaccine she felt fine. On Tuesday night she started to feel some itchiness. She said the itchiness got worse over the next two days. She talked to her husband and he advised her to take Benadryl so she took two Benadryl. On Wednesday she had some soreness at her injection site. Very early Thursday morning she noticed a golf ball sized knot in her armpit. She said it was sore and if she rubbed it, it felt like it was pushing into her breast. She said it felt like pressure going all the way to her breast bone and along her esophagus. She ended up calling EMS and her blood pressure was up to 181/107 and had a high heart rate. She said she never had any hives but did have some throat, tongue, and lip swelling and said that her throat felt raw. The EMS gave her 2 nitroglycerin tablets and 5 aspirin. She spent Friday and Saturday in the hospital. She said the hospital did all kinds of cardiac tests on her and everything can back clear besides a leaky heart valve. She said she is feeling much better now and that the hospital was not sure if it was a reaction to the vaccine, something else, or a combination of things that caused it.

A 61-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 09:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Asthma, HBP, High Cholesterol, prediabetes. Known allergies: Penicillin, Sulfa, Peanuts. Concomitant medication(s) included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; atenolol, chlortalidone (ATENOLOL/CHLORTHALIDONE) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; metformin (METFORMIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; sertraline hydrochloride (SERTRAL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. No other vaccine in four weeks. No covid prior vaccination. No covid tested post vaccination. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reactions, tired, earache, swelling, itching, stinging, peeling, hurt my, throat was swelling, couldn&#39;t sleep, rash, burning, the neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse. It was reported that 09Apr2021- got her 1st Pfizer COVID shot. Left arm. Felt okay afterward, got a little tired later on. On Sunday, she woke up w/an earache on her left side, which moved down into her neck - near her lymph nodes. Later, her neck started swelling/itching/stinging/feeling warm, and it hurt her throat to swallow anything. She went to get Benadryl and anti-itch creams, but they didn&#39;t work. The neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse, and at one point it felt like her throat was swelling and getting narrow, and she wondered if this was one of those anaphylactic reactions. So she took 2 Benadryl, and that seemed to help. That night she couldn&#39;t sleep for the neck heat, itching and throat pain. Monday AM (12Apr2021), she took her temp, which was 100.2. She did a Teladoc Zoom so the doc could see the situation, and he said that it could be a severe vaccine reaction, or some kind of infection. He prescribed prednisone &amp; clindimycin. The rash left scars, which are peeling. Ae resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Prescription drugs. Outcome of the events was recovering.

A 61-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in Arm Right on 08Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) (at the age of 61-years-old) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included breast cancer (2-time breast cancer survivor), had lymph nodes removed, and has low thyroid. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for low thyroid from an unspecified start date and ongoing; ascorbic acid, betacarotene, biotin, calcium, chloride, chromium, copper, folic acid, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, phosphorus, potassium, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin, selenium, silicon, thiamine, vanadium, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, vitamin k nos, xantofyl, zinc (CENTRUM SILVER WOMEN 50&#43;) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine (PEPCIDAC) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. Patient previously took shingles vaccine on an unknown date (reported as number of years ago) for immunization, flu shots on an unknown date for immunization and also previously took the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EN6200) (at the age of 61-years-old) on 15Feb2021, intramuscular administered in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation, and experienced injection site pain in right arm, sore arm and swollen gland. Patient stated having what was considered typical, like a sore arm and did have some swollen glands with the first and second dose. It was also reported that after 1st and 2nd dose, there was injection site pain in right arm. After second dose she developed shingles, or what was later found out to be shingles, she had extreme pain in her hand. She thought it was injured or something, it was very painful. She got shingles blisters on her hand, and then also got some on her arm, the opposite arm as the injection. Her dermatologist and internist verified it was shingles. Her internist said it may have been triggered by the vaccine. She clarified it started in the palm of her hand and then traveled up her arm on the opposite side of the vaccine, she got the vaccine in the right arm and the shingles in the left arm. She felt quite ill as a result of the shingles. Her dermatologist put on Valtrex, three times a day. It helped with the spread; it stopped spreading. Her dermatologist was not associating it with the vaccine, and she was not sure she was either. After not feeling well for several days she told internist and he was confident that the vaccine was what caused the shingles. She doesn&#39;t remember for sure the event extreme pain in left hand, but it was within a few days after the 2nd dose. The swollen glands started within 24 hours, as well as, the sore arm. It wasn&#39;t anything she didn&#39;t expect. Like with the flu shot maybe a little worse, but it wasn&#39;t severe. Her sore arm was not ongoing. It recovered completely by the next day. Swollen glands came back when the shingles first happened, but they initially began within 24 to 48 hours, for both doses. After the second dose she took two extra strength Tylenol again on the first night again; she just took it once after the 2nd dose. Pain in the hand was 98 to 95 percent better. Her doctor did whole blood work up (unknown results) just to see her white count (unknown results) to rule out something else. The blisters were too small for the dermatologist to scrape and get a biopsy. She did not get the most current 2 dose vaccine for shingles, she only got one dose and that was a number of years ago, she was going to get it but then COVID happened. The outcome of event herpes zoster and pain in extremity was resolving while for other events was unknown.   No follow up attempts are possible. Information about Lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 61-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COMIRANTY; Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 22Apr2021 12:10 (at the age of 61-year-old) as unknown single for COVID-19 immunization. This report was not related to a study or programme. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations was first time had flu shot made her very ill, next year doctor suggested she should just have half of a shot instead of full shot to see if she tolerated it and she was able to tolerate that. She had not any other problems with flu vaccines in general. Some of the other vaccines, she was just supposed to take Benadryl with them because of some of the filler ingredients people put in things. She had previously had the 1 dose shingles vaccine, but she had gotten probably shingles probably a couple of months after that so they encouraged her to get the 2 part shingles vaccine at a later date and told her to do the pre-medicate routine like Benadryl day before, day of and at least 2 days after shingles vaccine doses and if any major problems call for help. She did not have a noticeable problem from the 2 part shingles vaccine. Some of the times depends on what filler ingredients people use. She was allergic to nutmeg which was used as an emollient oil or it&#39;s called Myristicin something or other oil; if something has too high a dose of mannitol it can cause a problem. She has a very long list of allergies and high sensitivities; if it was a high enough sensitivity it goes in allergies list, even though it may not be a true allergy. Family has lots of allergies. Regarding prescribed indication additional details: She had 3 doctors who initially advised her to get the vaccine including her primary care physician, oncologist and haematologist; this was because she was a high risk person because of various health issues. Her haematologist 2-3 months ago when she had her last appointment with him he was saying to get the shot and prescribed the epi-pen at that time; no one was having it yet, but he expected she would have some sort of reaction to it not able to be covered by Benadryl alone. Medical history included ongoing platelet disorder Verbatim: Unidentified platelet disorder, Lots of allergies, cardiac murmur, ongoing asthma, osteoarthritis, glucose tolerance impaired, hypoglycaemia slow thyroid and back and neck pain. Concomitant medication(s) included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) taken for hypersensitivity (50mg taken as needed), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for hypersensitivity (10mg daily), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma (250/50 twice daily), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism (137mcg-1 tablet daily), methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN) (20mg tablet twice daily), salsalate, colestyramine (QUESTRAN LIGHT) (2-500mg tablets 3 times daily), sucralfate (CARAFATE) (1mg tablet 4 times daily-dosage verified with caller as milligrams and captured as provided), loperamide hydrochloride (LOMOTIL [LOPERAMIDE HYDROCHLORIDE]) (2.5/0.25 takes 2 tablets of that 4 times daily), calcium carbonate (CALCIUM OYSTER SHELL [CALCIUM CARBONATE]) (Alternates dose of 500mg and 1000mg on days takes Vitamin D), vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) (250 mg), vitamin D (50,000 units every other day taken), vitamin B12 (1mg injection every 14 days), clonazepam (KLONOPIN) (2-1mg tablets at bedtime), montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for asthma (10mg tablets at bedtime) and cefixime (FLEXERIL [CEFIXIME]) taken for back pain, neck pain (10mg tablets 3 times daily as needed). On 22Apr2021, Onset time: She had a note saying her eyes itchy at 12:20, but they were itching before that because she waited long enough to report it; so onset time was less than 10 minutes when her eyes started itching. Then her pulse; she could feel chest pain; heart palpitations; pulse felt like her heart was racing very hard. They did check her pulse while she was in their initial observation and her pulse was only in the 70s, but oxygenation was at 96%.When at doctors office less than 1 hour before that reading, oxygenation was at 98%.Recorded at 12:30 eyes itching much worse, throat felt like it was starting to tighten, heart felt like it was starting to race. By 12:50 hands were starting to swell. She had already been pre-medicated with Benadryl before this before she went down to get the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, she had Benadryl in her system. She had that same morning with her morning meds had taken Zyrtec and Benadryl in anticipation of getting the possibility of getting the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine because she has to pre-medicate for vaccines just in case she starts to react in anyway. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines was not administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. Emergency Room taken from the location where vaccine administered-they gave her Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine shot had her sit for basic observation then sit for extended observation. In that time period telling them her symptoms were going on, increasing. They gave her another 50mg Benadryl even though she had already had 1 before and then called emergency room, took her down, left her in waiting area even though she had heart and chest palpitations. Physician Office seen prior to event on 20Apr2021, seen after event 27Apr2021. Primary Care Physician didn&#39;t hear anything in lungs either visit. Not admitted to hospital; seen in emergency room, theoretically she got treated; however her basic blood pressure and stuff even with what they were doing was higher than when she was triaged in the ER; blood pressure was up and something else,oxygenation level moderately reduced from when she came down to when she was just let go; however her symptoms were worse when she was leaving than when she got there. She knows what they gave her while she was there was IV of normal saline, solumedrol and IV Benadryl. Thinks they later gave her Tylenol tablets. Finally got them to do an EKG because kept saying her chest was getting worse but that was several hours after she was back there even though came there having chest pains. In her opinion this hospital was not taking reaction seriously. Not admitted to hospital even though symptoms were worse and blood pressure higher on discharge, well above her normal levels. Currently trying to get them to explain why they took so long to do anything for her. Finally did a chest x-ray on 22Apr2021:discharge papers say abnormal x-ray and they gave a couple of different possibilities as to what that might be so Primary Care Physician wrote a prescription to get a follow-up chest x-ray to make sure that everything is fine and back to normal and not ongoing or progressing or anything because they gave some strange things: what their impressions were: findings: there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. It says the left lung appears clear; cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits; impression restates non specific right findings there is non specific interstitial disease in the right lower lobe that could represent atelectasis aspiration organomia. This was from front and lateral views of the chest x-ray at 19:00pm 22Apr2021. 2 ECGs: She guesses this is what they call EKG not, relevant point is that in the notes there for the records: Says abnormal ECG compared with blah blah blah, hard to find when exactly they wrote this, trying to get the exact wording for each of the two. Machine results CED, which caller explained is what they call themselves now instead of ER, notes for MD interpretation; one done at 17:53 , other at 21:32. They both say there was slightly different readings, however both say abnormal ECG. One of the wordings that is in both. She had no further details to provide regarding relevant testing/investigations. She had to be in the ER back in the room for several hours before they would do the EKG and that&#39;s only because she said I have chest pain and standard procedure is to do an EKG, had been back there for hours, they had done no tests, the only thing they did was basic blood panel, had not done a troponin or heart enzymes test, had not done EKG that&#39;s why she knows they were not taking her seriously at all; if someone says chest pains and you don&#39;t do anything in the standard protocol they are not taking you seriously. On this Monday, 2 days ago she had gone down to pick up the records from the ER to go to Primary Care Physician appointment 27Apr2021, finally actually got to speak to someone who said they would get back to her on 27Apr2021 to look into why the EKG tests were not done for someone having chest pains. That&#39;s one of the first things you do for someone having chest pain, no matter what the source. Frustrated with them because they&#39;re still not communicating back, they had not taken her seriously while she was there; unknown if they were actually going to be reporting, as they were still trying to convince her to get the second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. If she reacted to the first dose in first 10 minutes, second dose could be much more of a reaction. With the amount of anti-histamines in her system with Benadryl and Zyrtec and she was still starting to react in under 10 minutes. It&#39;s possible to be one of the inactive ingredients but she doesn&#39;t see anything in the pamphlet provided that she could identify at first glance as being the culprit to the problem other than 2 possibilities: potassium chloride and other is monobasic potassium phosphate. There is a possibility of her having a reaction to those because she was known to react to certain potassium products; sometimes it was the inactive ingredients. She definitely would have wanted to get the second part of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine series until after she was not getting the medical attention she needed after reaction to the first dose. Because ideally you&#39;re supposed to have it at the same location, that just made her very nervous at the prospect of worse reaction at location that did not take her serious the first time. She was a big fan of Pfizer thought they do a great job; she had not known it was a 2 parter, not that it should make much difference. When her Primary Care Physician was saying second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine was out of the question and she had been saying to people that she did not think it would be prudent to take the second part, they kept trying to say oh you need to get the second part, talk to so and so so they can convince you to get it, and doctor is going no. She reacted to ringers lactate or lactated ringers whatever the name is, her retired nurse sister sat and watched her getting some ringers lactate prior to surgery for her tear duct and saw her starting to break out in red splotches, patient said she was itching. Action taken in response to the events was drug withdrawn. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 62-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 28Dec2020 at 14:15 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included environmental allergies, she has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume, blood pressure (abnormal) and sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included ongoing lisinopril for blood pressure, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took novocaine but was allergic.  She got all this information when she got the vaccine on Monday at (place name) in (state name). It tells all the side effects from the first injection. She wanted to report that it is the same arm that she got the vaccine in. She has swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm.  It says you can have joint pain, but nothing about swelling. She thought she better report it. This was her first shot. She is supposed to get the second one on 18Jan2021. She wanted to make sure she can take it. She received the vaccine on 28Dec2020. She laid around that day. Today is the first day she doesn&#39;t have arm pain and swelling at the injection site.  It was the first time she has had arm pain. She has never had that with flu shot. The arm pain started within the 15 minutes she was observed. It hurt like hell until that day. She got a bruise at the injection site. It bled a little bit when she put it in. Swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm: she doesn&#39;t know if it was later that day. She can&#39;t remember. She really noticed it yesterday. She has never had joint pain or swelling. She doesn&#39;t have any problems with arthritis. Now her little finger is bigger than the rest of her fingers. It hurts because of the swelling. She doesn&#39;t want to take anything. It might be fluid. She has a high pain tolerance. She keeps bending it thinking it will get better. It isn&#39;t as bad, but its still swelled up. At first she thought it was better, but it is still pretty swollen. To her this is a reaction. She was thinking if she took paracetamol before, it wouldn&#39;t hurt as bad, but she can&#39;t remember if she took it that morning. She takes 500mg before bed for the heck of it at night. It helps her sleep better. She has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume. They think she was allergic to the preservative in the flu shot, but she has never had any trouble with the flu shot since. She has environmental allergies. They thought she was allergic to Novocaine once at the dentist office. Who knows, it only happened once. She&#39;s been to the dentist many times and who knows what they injected and why she reacted that way. She felt like she was going to pass out. They don&#39;t give it to her anymore. She doesn&#39;t know what was in it. She is worried since this vaccine is emergency authorization. She doesn&#39;t want to get the next one and have a worse reaction. She is not sure if she should be worried. The events of swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm were assessed as medically significant. Outcome of the event of &#39;swelling of fingers&#39; was not recovered, the other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event joint pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the event swelling with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

For the past 3 years I have been medication free and virtually symptom free.  The symptoms of the last few days are consistent with those I had during the years when my MCAD  was active.  I am concerned that the vaccine has reactivated the hyper-sensitivity of my mast cells.

I had covid 19 in October 2020 and found the body aches after the vaccine to be worse than having the virus itself. Second day after vaccine I noticed lymph node in my armpit to be very swollen. This was the same side of my body the shot was given. I am worried about getting the second dose but I am still going to get it.

                                                I am submitting this as a supplementary report to the report assigned on March 1, 2021.  This is day 10 after the vaccine and my mast cell reactivity symptoms have increased by the day--internal and external swelling, flushing, pruritis, wheezing, tightness in chest, as well as pain and pressure in arm pits, groin, and ears.  By late afternoon I am severely fatigued, weak, and foggy-headed.  These symptoms are consistent with those I experienced during the twenty years when my mast cell disease was unstable.  Through identification of my triggers and avoidance of the same, I have been symptom and medication free for the past three years--until taking the Covid-19 vaccine.  It appears that the vaccine has reactivated an excessive degranulation response in my mast cells and that response is getting worse as my body responds to the vaccine.  I realize that the percentage of persons who suffer from a condition like mine is small, but I would have appreciated having the information that I am submitting to you when I was weighing the pros and cons of vaccination.  I know from the twenty years of navigating this disease that there is nothing that can be done at this point other than taking various H1 and H2 blockers.  This vaccine appears to be undoing the hard-won level of stability achieved through years of careful lifestyle management.

I stayed in place until I felt better about 30 minutes. For the rest of that day and the next day I was extremely tired, a little nauseous, and kind of out of it. The third day I had very sore left arm at site and very sore and tender lymph notes on left side of Arm and trunk. Six days after the shot I came suddenly down with a massive headache and diarrhea. Al has since resolved and I am on day eight.

Swelling, consistent aching pain, and limited range of motion/inability to lift arm over her head.  Motrin for 2 days was self administered with improvement in severity of pain but recurred when Motrin discontinued.  Motrin was taken as needed thereafter and was the pain continued until 2/26.  Employee was followed up on 3/10 and verbalized that the pain had fully resolved. No further interventions.

                                                Patient has allergies to several medications and keeps epipen on hand with her always. Was asked to sit for 30  minutes after vaccine. At minute 27 she started getting swelling and redness of her lips and face slightly. She normally takes Benadryl when this happens so gave her a Benadryl 50mg one dose. Her throat then became tight in a few minutes and she said that she needed an epipen because she was starting to have a little bit of trouble breathing. Gave epipen and her symptoms resolved within a few minutes. Kept her for 15 minutes. She stated that she knew she would be ok and asked if she could leave. I stated she needed to see the ER if she had any more trouble. I also consulted with her to check with her doctor about getting the 2nd dose because more than likely it&#39;s not recommended.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after vaccination, patient began feeling bumps on lip and swelling under jaw.  Soon after, she felt flushed with itching in feet and swelling of feet. I observed a mild redness to face and upper chest. I saw no swelling of neck, lips or oral cavity. I ordered 25 mg. benedryl po be administered at 3:10 PM.  A few minutes later, she felt tightness in chest. At that point (3:15 PM) an EMT tried to inject an Epipen but only left the pen in for less than 1/4 second before she withdrew the pen. I then administered another Epipen directly after and the pen was in her thigh for over 3 seconds. The patient was transferred light and sirens to ER. She received no further Epi in the ER and received steroids, benedryl, and famotidine  according to the ER Resident. She was doing well 90 minutes after vaccination per Dr.

The next morning on 20Feb2021 when she woke up she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed, but that went away. The armpit swelling has continued since the day of the vaccine. Now this morning in Feb2021 she had a mucus plug and was bleeding she haven&#39;t had her period for 8 years, every two days she had something new. Patient wanted to know what had been woken up in her body.

On 2/8, I had a tele visit with my doctor. I took Tylenol as instructed to make sure that I didn&#39;t develop a fever. My doctor said that it could be from the vaccine. My left leg and foot were swollen on 2/13, so I called my doctor again and he sent me for a Doppler to check for a blood clot. I saw him on 2/15 in person. I have lower back pain and weakness in my legs at times, but it doesn&#39;t prevent me from doing anything. They feel heavy, especially if I walk for an extended period of time.

                                                My arm has remained sore since the shot 4 days ago.  Specifically in the armpit but aches all the way down to my hand at time.  My armpit is swollen and painful.  The pain goes thru my underarm down to my hand. The pain makes it difficult to sleep. Tylenol doesn&#39;t take the pain away.  At first I thought the pain was a side effect to  the initial vaccine, but it got worse as time went on.  Finally I researched it on line and saw that lymph nodes have been reported as swelling due to the vaccine.

Medics responded, as we were talking, realized numbness had followed the trigeminal nerve back to the ear, and then from the ear, toward the nose. we determined it was not life threatening, and I was asked to contact my healthcare provider. Left lower quandrant of cheek/face was swollen for between 24 - 36 hours. Developed diarrhea 24 hours after injection.

This 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Feb2021 at 12:00 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was unknown. Concomitant medications were none. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks or other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced fever 103 white posture on knee that turned into cellulitis and lymphadenitis. The patient had IV antibiotics twice within 5 days of vaccine as treatment for events. The patient still had swollen from groin area down to knee. AE resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had no covid prior vaccination, no covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event cellulitis is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2 based on the information provided. The event onset date is not reported, therefore the drug-event temporal relationship is not clear. In addition, the BNT162B2 vaccine was administered in the arm but the reported cellulitis was at knee area. It is very unlikely that the cellulitis was related to BNT162B2.

A 62-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: FR8737and expiry date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in left arm, on 07Apr2021, as a single dose (at the age of 62-years) for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6201 and expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, in left upper arm, on 05Mar2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient arm hurt after first dose (began immediately and lasted for about 4 days) which was resolved on 09Mar2021. Patient second dose was scheduled on 27Mar2021, but she did not get it till 07Apr2021. It was reported that on 08Apr2021, patient had such an awful reaction to the second dose of the vaccine. She started to get dizzy and weak, chills, everything was a blur, sweating, could not drink threw up if she tried dry heave went back to sleep and slept for 48 hours had just chills the whole time. She was in bed sleeping trying to drink, getting up to go to the bathroom and feeling like she was going to die for the next three days. She was nauseated and is still nauseated and could not drive. She took Tylenol an antiemetic at urgent care that stopped. She took Zofran with the saline solution infusion and she went home and slept. She was dehydrated and had soreness all over. On 09Apr2021, she could not roll over and had a sore on her left butt cheek that was still there cold sores on lips. She thought the sore on her left butt cheek came from laying in bed so much, and it was not in any other space but that one spot almost like she would have gotten the shot there, but she didn&#39;t. On 10Apr2021, patient felt like she was going to die, and went to urgent care and asked if they could give her fluids. They gave her fluids and Zofran and that helped a lot. This one shocked the hell out her, she thinks it was her gums that started to bleed on 11Apr2021. She had the best oral hygiene and went to the dentist all the time. She was flosses like crazy. She started to drink a ton of water and has not seen it since. She cannot guess what the reason was. On 11Apr2021, she could function a little and had chills again last night and sweating. She did not have a fever. She ate chicken noodle soup water and a little bit of ginger ale. She started to feel better, but not 100% better not even 90%, not even 80%, but was heading towards the right direction. Patient also hasn&#39;t eaten for 5 days after second dose. She experienced cold and hot. She was not complaining at all and she has been sick for days and cannot eat and will throw up but will gain it right back. The dizziness and weakness were subsided. She feels like she is getting beat up but is recovering. Patient thought that vaccine pulled out with a syringe and that&#39;s the problem everyone gets the same dose. Patient&#39;s weight was 136 or 138 lbs. Outcome of the events nauseated after second dose was resolved on 10Apr2021, and dizzy and weak after second dose was resolved on an unknown date in Apr 2021, and for the events chills and sweating it was recovering, and for all other events, it was unknown.

She adds that maybe she had a reaction to the chemicals in there.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient, self-reported). A 62-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6206 and expiry date: was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in arm left, on 10Mar2021 at 03:30 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization, at hospital. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID-19, before the vaccination, however, results not provided. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19, after the vaccination. Patient&#39;s medical history included breast cancer survivor, chronic lymphatic leukemia. Patient had known allergies with penicillin and sulfa. Concomitant medications included calcium, colecalciferol (D3), macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX), multi vitamin, and ibuprofen (ADVIL DUAL). The patient previously took ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and morphine: and had allergies with both drugs. The patient reported that on 11Mar2021, her heart was fluttering and beating it out of her chest with elevated heart rate which goes up and down. She also felt her heart was racing. It was very erratic. The highest heart rate was 130 (non-sustained). It was started since morning after the vaccination and was still happening now and wanted to know that it was a normal side effect. She had a cardiac work up and couldn&#39;t find anything however, everything was normal. Her heart rate went up to 130, 140, 150 and went to 80. This was happened over a period of 5 or 6 days. She felt like she could not do anything and was lying in bed or on the couch for three days. Her white blood cell count was higher that it should be. She went to her regular doctor who did the EKG, however, results not provided. Further, she went to a Cardiologist and they did another EKG and wore a monitor for a week and did echocardiogram and blood work all results were normal. She was wondering, if this could possibly be a side effect from the vaccine because it did occur in the morning after she got vaccinated. She also reported that she had allergies to medications but not what was in the vaccine and that maybe she had a reaction to the chemicals in the vaccine. She was supposed to get the second shot of vaccine which was scheduled on 31Mar2021 and had concerned about getting the second shot because she had some allergies and now this happened. She was very frightening and thought that she was going to die. It was very scary for her. The product complaint was not reported. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. Outcome of the event Allergy to chemicals was unknown and for all other events it was recovered on an unknown date in Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

                                                Bell&#39;s Palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 63-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: ELD14D, via an unspecified route of administration, in left side of arm, on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included early breast cancer from 2017 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included tamoxifen citrate 20 mg tablet by mouth once daily from 2017 and ongoing for breast cancer (cancer pill, she has to be on it for 5 years). The patient received the vaccine as she is &#34;with fire department, thought she needed to take it, she had early breast cancer, is around lots of people&#34;. On 09Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, assessed as medically significant and in Jan2021 she experienced earache (she thought it was an earache, but it was more than that, but it made her ear hurt, and she has no infection), her mouth was drawled a little, further detailed as numbness and &#34;the eye, it is messing with it, when she is trying to see out of it, she can see, but it&#39;s blurry like&#34; and, &#34;where the ear thing is&#34;, on the back of the lymph node was real sore and her face was kind of puffy, which is the reason she went to the doctor. The patient had to go to her doctor, he told her she had a reaction to the shot, he called it Bell&#39;s Palsy, and said to let Pfizer know. Her doctor gave her something to take for mouth drawled/numbness, which is supposed to help, and she has to go back in a week. The event Bell&#39;s palsy outcome was unknown at the time of the report.

Just the injection process alone made me feel ill. So I waited the 15 minutes before I left, until I felt safe to drive. At noon the meds started affecting me, which is what I expected. I&#39;ve continued to experience arm pain, weakness, armpit swelling and tenderness, arm not wanting to work and posturing. This is day four and its just starting to feel like its coming back &#34;online.&#34; Monday I reported to Colleague Health, who advised me to contact my physician, who I consulted via phone this morning. Physician requested I fill out Adverse Event form.

                                                Patient received her vaccine on Thursday, 1/21/21.  From then until Saturday afternoon she had been experiencing extreme fatigue.  On Sat. around 5:00 PM she was standing at her flat-top stove cooking dinner.   A wave of very extreme fatigue came over her, so she leaned over to turn off the burner.  When she did this, she passed out leaning forward with her hand on the burner and touching the frying pan.  When she came to, she went to the couch and laid down - not realizing for 10 minutes that her hand and right breast were burned.   The resulting injuries lead to her having to see her PCP on Monday, and then a General Surgeon on Weds 1/27/21.   Injuries sustained include a second degree burn on her right breast, On the right arm, laterally above the wrist is a small superficial partially healed burn.  On the dorsal aspect of the right fifth finger there is a longitudinal burn that goes from the MCP joint to almost the tip of the finger.  She has limited range of motion due to discomfort and swelling.  The blister encompasses the entire dorsal lateral aspect of the finger. The fourth right finger has a less extensive blistered area on the PIP joint.   The burn on the fifth finger is  deep second degree.

A 63-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot EJ1686, expiry date not reported), intramuscular on 02Jan2021 17:00 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, known allergies to latex and has covid-19, all from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient was not pregnant at the time of the vaccination. Concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide, potassium chloride, and calcium citrate (CITRACAL). The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Patient stated that a cooler used to transport the covid 19 vaccines had a temperature of 31 to 33 degrees F and she was concerned about the vaccines on the bottom of the shipper that were next to the dry ice in the shipper (date unspecified). Patient wanted temperature excursion data for the covid 19 vaccine and stated in Jan2021 she felt hot at the injection site, swelling, tired, arm pain and had bruising after the first shot because of improper technique (02Jan2021 17:00). Patient reported on the first dose having only arm pain, chills, and tiredness, and headache in Jan2021. Patient also stated that the first dose was much better tolerated. Patient stated some of her pharmacist friends have had the same effects from the vaccine. Patient wanted to verify that the vaccine in the syringe is good for 6 hours and that she read Moderna is effective for 1 year and Pfizer is good for 6 to 12 months. She does not think her vaccination of covid 19 was valid because she thinks the temperature that the pharmacist recorded was not correct. Patient wanted to know if she should get tested to see if the vaccine worked. Patient stated that Pfizer is too complex and has too many pieces and states they need to give more information about how to use the thermal shipper. The patient had Covid test post vaccination as nasal swab on (BioReference COVID-19 Nasopharynx) on 26Jan2021 with results as pending. No treatments received felt hot at the injection site, swelling, tired, arm pain, had bruising after the first shot, chills and headache. The patient did recover from the events felt hot at the injection site, swelling, tired, arm pain, had bruising after the first shot, chills and headache on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

                                                Pt complained of throat tightness and being lightheaded beginning at 1127 hours (5 minutes after vaccine).  She arrived at emergency/symptoms reporting station at 1129 hours.  She denied tongue swelling, denied rash, denied difficulty speaking.  No rash was seen by medics either.  Pt did not have wheezing or stridor.  Medics on scene and student medics under the direction of Medics, placed the patient on the monitor.  Her HR was stable in the 70s and her sats were 99-100% on room air, with a strong pulse and RR of 16.  The pt became more anxious and demanded that someone assist her with her Epi pen administration. RN explained sxs of anxiety and sxs of anaphylaxis.  Pt became agitated and again remained adamant that medics give her Epi.  At 1132 hours a student medic under the direction of Medics administered the pts own epi pen to her.  Vitals signs after epi were HR of 88, BP of 170/97, RR 22, sats 100% .  A transport unit was called as precaution and to potentially transport.  Pt appeared to have an increase in agitation as indicated by her speech with medics being short and her stating that she was &#34;irritated&#34; with &#34;everyone talking&#34;, that she &#34;can&#39;t hear everyone all at the same time&#34;, that this is just &#34;too much&#34; and waving her hands in the air.  Pt was transported to the ER via Medics for continued care and follow up.

                                                No issues during 15 minute observation period after receiving the vaccine. So I left the facility to go to my car. Then about 15 minutes later my  face started to get really hot with  slight swelling. Then after several more minutes throat became tight and started to experience extreme  difficulty swallowing.   I was still in the parking lot so I immediately went back inside to the vaccination area asking for help.  I did not experience any breathing difficulties during the entire time but did experience extreme difficulty with swallowing and throat tightening.   The staff did the usual  checks. I was not too awarre of all the things they did but I was given a benedryl tablet which I was able to swallow thankfully. I was told my vitals were very high.  Not sure of exact times but sometime shortly after the benedryl things started to fell better.  The throat/swallowing started to get better.  Face burning started to cool.  Stayed in this area for about 20 or 30 more minutes and then told I could go with a comment that I should see my doctor about my high blood pressure.  Which I explained I do not have high blood pressure and when checked later in the day it was back to my usual 115 - 125 range .  I was concerned about getting the second shot later and was told to take a benedryl either just before I get the next shot or right after.??????   After checking the online cdc guidelines that does not jive at all.

                                                The following day after the 2nd vaccine, I felt a small itching on the left side of my neck/shoulder blade. I didn&#39;t scratch but I felt swelling.   After softly rubbing my neck, I felt a little bubble as if there was liquid in the bubble area.  I thought maybe it was a side effect so I waited  a full week.  Along with the itching &amp; swelling, there was a small amount of tender pain.  The swelling still persists.  On the 10th day after the vaccination (March 15th), I saw my doctor.  He felt the same area  sensation of a bubble around my shoulder blade.  So far, there has been no treatment.

After 2 weeks most of the swelling is gone just a slight bit. Headaches have been every day until yesterday.  Went to dr the following Monday after the vaccine as was give some anti inflammatory shots in my neck as not allowed anything ( cortisone) due to vaccine. Taking Tylenol and Advil and using Valteran.  Dr was not sure if from exercise or the vaccine but have been exercising throughout the pandemic. Never had headaches when my neck would bother me only hand tingling and that was not this time.  The acupuncturist today said still a bit swollen and tender and feels that it is a combination of the neck and the vaccine as the vaccine attacked my most vulnerable spot.  I had a massage today to to try to stretch my neck.  Headache is doing better today and I can move my neck more.

I stayed about an hour because I was scared to drive. I later got chills and fever for about 24 hours.  I eventually developed shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness, tightness in my throat, bruising in my legs and painful lymph nodes in my neck and arms. One day, I felt like I was having a mini-stroke. It only lasted for a brief period and then went away. That has occurred multiple times. My doctor thinks some of my issues were due to anxiety, but I don&#39;t agree because I&#39;m fine now.

I noticed a swelling between my left breast and my armpit. It developed into a very pronounced lump at my armpit and toward left breast. There was tenderness when I used the arm.  As of today, the swelling is down- not quite normal yet- but no tenderness.

She called on 13Mar2021, her blood pressure was so low-they got 58 for the top number, they were unable to pull up bottom number at that point. patient reported that when the ambulance arrived, they described her face as extremely pale on 13Mar2021; her major complaint was that she was so cold- she has never been that cold in her life. When she got to the ER- they had to use the old blood pressure cuff to get her blood pressure because it wasn&#39;t coming up on the machine- the kind where you pump it up and watch the needle, they said it was 58/38. patient states that they asked her about the rash that was all over her body in 2021; caller reports that she did not have a rash when she called at 4 PM. patient describes the rash as an extremely red sunburn rash- like you got really bad sunburn, most of it was on her torso, she also had it on legs on 13Mar2021. patient mentioned she remembers them taking off sock and her toes were purple on 13Mar2021. She also had a red on her eyelids- she described as itchy and swollen on 13Mar2021. patient mentions that unbelievably as sick as she was in 2021, she could understand everything that they were telling her. Treatment was given as they prescribed her Prednisone and Benadryl; she was also hooked up to an IV, and they were trying to warm up her body because body temperature was low in 2021. Discharge paper reads as anaphylaxis due to vaccination on 13Mar2021. patient states that she came home from hospital on Monday, 15Mar2021. patient reports she started a diet. 2nd day (12Mar2021)- From the time she got up, she was too cold to do anything; she couldn&#39;t walk and she was feeling like she was getting the flu. Saturday (13Mar2021)- She woke up and had the worst Charlie horse between ankle and calf- took forever to walk Charlie horse off. Really sharp Charlie horse. Even had less energy today. Really nauseated. patient reports that yesterday and today, she is just tired. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her body catching up on sleep or she&#39;s just tired; she will find out today when she goes to doctor. Caller mentions that she is normally more active than she feels right now. patient reports her eyes have been itchy and she has a rash on her eyelids. patient doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the shot; patient mentions that she decided on 01Mar2021 she would start a diet, get healthy, and see a nutritionist. patient reports that initially she didn&#39;t think her symptoms were from the vaccine and thought it was that she wasn&#39;t eating enough food on Friday. She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021. The diarrhea was gone, but now she has a mixture of soft stools and semi formed. It is trying to improve but hasn&#39;t yet. patient states that because of her creatinine level, they did want her to drink and she might have soft stools because she was drinking so much. patient reports she knows when her husband put the shirt on her she did not have the rash, but when the ambulance arrived, they said she had the rash. Upon discharge, they told her not to receive any further covid vaccines- she cannot get her second one which was scheduled for 01Apr2021. She started experiencing the really cold feeling on 12Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine. She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved. Treatment for her face was so red like the rough sunburn feeling and putting moisturizer on the dried cheeks. patient reports that she doesn&#39;t see any patches of red on her. Part of her has a fear that the stuff is not totally out of her system and it will happen again. patient mentions she has heard comments that this was not a typical reaction from the first one and wants to know if it is typical to be that sick from the first dose. patient reports that now her eyes just feel like she&#39;s allergic to something. She doesn&#39;t know if the redness is from crying now- it was improving, but was still there. Husband has Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia and she is his caregiver, she cannot afford to get Covid, she wants to get back to normal. patient reports that she did not take any of her prescriptions the day of the vaccine, she did not want to get a reaction. patient reports she had her shoulder- torn rotator cuff-operated on in 2018. If nose is really stuffed up or allergies, or Fluticasone nasal spray- she can take it 2 times a day, 2 squirts in each nostril, take it as needed. patient reports that she has the worst sinuses- when it gets too bad, she&#39;ll go to the doctor and she&#39;ll prescribe Flonase, take Metamucil or whatever she thinks will help with sinuses. she still wants to get the second vaccine. patient reports her creatinine came down well enough that she could come home from the hospital, it was still high on 15Mar2021 so they told her to drink lots of water so she does not get dehydrated.

Don&#39;t know if this happened when she got Hashimoto&#39;s, Thyroid, ongoing Vestibular Issues Started 5 years ago. States one doctor thinks it is her bad neck. States when she got old things shifted and changed. One ENT said she has neuritis, where something hit her ear nerve in right ear. States hence that was what the acyclovir was for, when she feels an earache coming on, she takes acyclovir. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). AEs following prior vaccinations: None; reported she hadn&#39;t had any flu vaccines in years because of the ingredients.

On 01APR2021, she could feel rush of pressure to back of head, tunnel vision, cloudy and pressure in her ears and was dizzy. Hx of Hashimoto&#39;s - autoimmune disorder, vestibular issue, concerns with getting the second one (dose). Read about adverse reactions and dizziness was on the list of severe reactions. The instant, within a minute, patient could feel this happening to her, she instantly could feel she becoming dizzy, light headed, out of body experience like floating. (didn&#39;t mention this in report) felt like walking on air. While sitting and chit chatting with other people to distract myself. Patient didn&#39;t have any anxiety. She will admit she was reluctant to get the vaccine because of my health problems.  She was more concerned, she instantly got a headache with the pressure, when she was leaving, she felt her eyes feel weird, almost like an allergy issue, burning, not quite burning either. Kind of like a burning, not quite like a burning, felt like when you walk into the wind that has lots of pollen,  that feeling. She didn&#39;t walk out side, she was inside when this happened, the pressure was already starting, no headache in front of head, it was in back of my skull, at top of her neck and pressure within the ears and ache and pressure on back of her head. Not dizzy, not like when you are in the hospital and they give she something and patient can&#39;t walk, or where you tried to stand and you couldn&#39;t , it was more like light headed, like walking on air like. It lasted all yesterday. As the night progressed by 10PM or 11PM her arm started to really hurt, patient took Tylenol and went to bed, took Xanax as she did and slept, woke up fine. This morning it felt like she wanted to have a headache but haven&#39;t had it since. It&#39;s almost like patient had intracranial pressure, because she had these conditions, so she read a lot. Investigation Assessment was No. States she is calling to report a potentially strange side effect. She states as soon as she got the injection, approximately within one-two minutes, she could feel a rush to the back of her head and the lower part of her head which then made her feel like she had somewhat of her vision clouded, like a tunnel vision. Clarifies her vision was clouded on the sides but she could see forward. Caller states that she was not dizzy like falling over and she does have vestibular migraines and vertigo issues, but she had that feeling of dizziness and when she got up and walked, it felt like she was walking on a cloud. Clarifies she felt a heavy pressure in the back of her head. States as soon as the injection was over, she could feel it. States she is concerned regarding the second dose because of her autoimmune and vestibular conditions. She states is caused immediate pressure in her ears. States that could&#39;ve affected her and put her into a migraine, she doesn&#39;t know. States a friend said jeez you should report that and she read more on the list of side effects and saw something about an allergic reaction and dizziness, and she did have some sort of adverse reaction. States she doesn&#39;t know and it is concerning to her. States she is doing fine today, other than a little headache that comes and comes. States it was bizarre with the  clouded, not cloudy, but tunnel vision. States she does not want to release any medical records; she declines for now to provide. She states CVS administered it, not her doctor. States she is going to discuss it with him. States she doesn&#39;t want to have a worse reaction with the second dose. Caller states a headache is a headache but the pressure she felt within one minute and continuing it concerns her on the second one with the larger dose. States she is also concerned with the second dose if dizziness is a severe allergic reaction, not saying she  fell over and wiped out. Patient wondering if that was an allergic reaction. States as the evening went on and she took Tylenol, it improved. States the dizziness improved as the night went on but had a bizarre feeling when she went to bed. States her arm was sore in the evening and is still sore to the touch. Clarifies that her eyes felt funny. States like walking through a stream of pollen, not that she had itchy eyes, but it felt like she had been effected by something. States it was not like a tired and burning feeling, states she can&#39;t explain it but something felt like had an allergy type situation if she has a problem with seasonal allergies. Treatment included took Tylenol. States when someone has an autoimmune issue they have a lot of issues regarding the stomach and take a lot of vitamins and supplements. Caller states she wants to report she has a lot of food sensitivities and environmental sensitivities because of her Hashimotos. States anything can set off an immune response. States what happens with that is she would get on her face, angioedema near her ears and the gland secretes and the passage way swells up. States she takes Pepcid AC to treat it. States this did not happen with her first vaccine. States she was very hesitant on taking the vaccine because knows she has these issues and she didn&#39;t want to have adverse reactions. States that her reaction to the first vaccine potentially concerns her for the second dose. States going to speak with the medical information department is a good idea. States the location she received her vaccine was very busy. States they did a nice and good job on getting people in. States the girl administering it did good, but she didn&#39;t mention unless you knew you had to wait 15 minutes due to possible adverse reactions, they didn&#39;t really check on people. States she just had to do whatever and she didn&#39;t know whether or not to report it then because she was not in distress. States she thought she just has to get home and drove 30 miles. All events (AEs) did not require a visit to Emergency Room nor Physician Office. The events of Tunnel vision, rush of pressure to back of head and the lower part of head, Headache, dizzy/Dizziness/light headed, cloudy and pressure in her ears/Ear Pressure, was recovered on 01Apr2021, of my arm started to really hurt/Sore Arm; sore to touch was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

A 63-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8729), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Apr2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as many medical conditions, names unknown, just a combination of medical problems. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications, some of which were taken in the morning. The patient had the vaccine on 02Apr2021 (reported as &#34;Friday or Saturday&#34;) in the afternoon and had a bad adverse reaction to it. The patient had swelling in the face, hives on her back, itching that was in her back, and, allergic reactions on 02Apr2021. Due to these, since she was just in a medical facility, doctor and nurses over there were able to inject her with Benadryl that was a strong dose, in a long needle given into the muscle and stuff. It was good enough that she got up and was sent home. She then seemed to be fine but on Monday, 05Apr2021, she couldn&#39;t get out of the bed as the pain all the way down to her back was killing her, like it was paralyzing her. She could not even get out of the bed for like hours. The neck and back pain on Apr2021 were pretty intense, and she does not know where and how it came so she was trying to figure that out and realized she just recently had the vaccine injection. She knew that there could be some kind of reaction, but she was not sure if it were from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure she did not get something serious because she already has rare conditions. She added she did not have any prior treatment for these because she did not even think like this was even a side effect of the Pfizer vaccine but now she was wondering if it was because she had not taken anything prior. She does not know if it was related or not and she was concerned about it. She wanted to know what she could do if these were side effects because she knew there were some people that have something to do with the spinal cord and she was not sure if their symptoms were like hers or not. She wanted to know if she would need treatment for it and if it was an adverse reaction. She added that the swelling in her face and, itching that was in her back went away the same day when she was given the vaccine. The outcome of the events swelling in the face and itching that was in her back was recovered on 02Apr2021. The outcome of the other remaining events was unknown.

A 63-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 14Apr2021 10:00 (lot number: EP7533) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing nickel allergy for decades which was under control and panic attacks. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 14Apr2021, it was reported that the patient didn&#39;t have any of the normal side effects such as fevers or chills but she was just tired and went to sleep early that night. She woke up on 15Apr2021 at 05:00 with incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit that she wears to bed. She has a history of nickel allergy and she bought this particular Fitbit on purpose because it doesn&#39;t have any nickel in it that touches her skin and she has had no problems all year with the Fitbit. The itching was unbelievably bad and when she took the Fitbit off she had a horrible whelp under a tiny piece of metal that isn&#39;t even supposed to touch her skin. She thought well if it has exacerbated her nickel allergy then maybe it is doing something else to her body. On that day (15Apr2021), she thought that she had a panic attack and upon reading some information online, she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction because the symptoms are the same. She was thinking that the vaccine is doing something with her nickel allergy. It had used to be bad until she got it under control and she had it under control for many years. But with the things under the Fitbit she was blaming or associating it with the COVID vaccine so she took it off and then finally fell asleep again. But when she woke up in the morning, just a few hours later (15Apr2021), the bad whelp was still there and then her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling so she decided to look some more on google and she thinks that this is another version to an allergic reaction. She has had panic attacks before and she knows what they are now and she has learned through a therapist on how to get past and manage them but this was different for her. It was like heaviness on her chest and it felt like something was on top of her chest and she was having trouble breathing; both on an unspecified date in 2021. Her husband knows when she has a panic attack but this one was different she can&#39;t really explain it. She asks, what is the difference between a panic attack breathing and this type of breathing and later mentioned that she also had a little soreness (2021). In addition, the physician also called to report that this patient was complaining about 2 types of symptoms. The first was more an allergic contact dermatitis (2021) which the physician is not worried about. The second was lip swelling and tongue tingling which could be a type 1 hypersensitivity (2021). The physician is more concerned about the latter and would like to know if  it is okay to pre-medicate the patient with Benadryl before getting the second dose. The outcome of the event &#39;she was just tired&#39; was recovered on 14Apr2021; incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp was recovering; her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling was recovered on 15Apr2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

This 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 06Jan2021 13:00 on left arm at single dose (Lot # EL1284) for COVID prevention. Medical history included ongoing arthritis in some form probably since 2011 (reported as ten years ago, as of 07Jan2021), ongoing Osteoporosis had it probably at least since five years ago, maybe longer, ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus had it probably since 2016 (reported as five years ago, as of 07Jan2021) High cholesterol this is managed or lowered with medication, and was diagnosed in 2001 (reported as probably 20 years ago, as  of 07Jan2021) her whole family has it. Concomitant medications were none. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM at age of 64-year-old on right arm at single dose (Lot # EL0140) for COVID prevention. She says that the first time she got the injection in her right arm, but the second time her right arm was still hurting, which she has arthritis over there also, this time she got the injection in her left arm. She says that the soreness or sharp pain under her left ear could be or not be related. She experienced soreness to arm injection site. She says that the area below her left ear doesn&#39;t feel swollen, it just feels like not a sore throat, but every so often she has a sharp pain, and it could be that she slept on it wrong. She says she was wondering if that goes away fast or is connected, like a possible side effect. The patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine 06Jan2020 13:00 and reported to have a sharp pain/soreness right below her left ear on 07Jan2021, sharp pain below left ear that comes and goes. She read that swollen lymph nodes were a side effect and is asking if that area is a lymph node and would that be considered a side effect and is asking how long it will it take before it goes away. She is wondering since side effects said might have lymph node swelling or something. She says in her arm where her shot was given is sore, and also kind of right below her left ear, which she thinks that is where a lymph node is. She says every so often she has a sharp pain there that goes away, and she wanted to know if this could be a part of it, since she is guessing that is where a lymph node is, or wondering it this is something even related that could be a side effect. Treatment included she took Tylenol Rapid Relief Extra Strength a while ago, dose queried but not provided. EXP: Jul2022, LOT: SJA072, this is not on the bottle, it must have been on an outer box which was discarded. Treatments received for the events pain, pain in ear, vaccination site pain and swollen lymph nodes. Outcome of the events were unknown.

She read that the lymph nodes could swell under the arm on the side, the shot was given and it did plus the area were sore, this was on 10Jan2021. On 12Jan2021, in the morning, is when she noticed that in the lymph area and going to the outer breast there are red splotches. It was not tender or warm to the touch and she can tell it will fade on its own but she thought it was weird. It might have been there the day before; she didn&#39;t really look. Currently there was still soreness with the lymph nodes but she would have to press to feel it, she would say that was over. She has a picture if needed of the red splotches. Patient stated that she is healthy for her age. She has no medical conditions or takes no medications. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of the lymph node pain was not recovered while for the other events was unknown.

                                                COVID- 19 Vaccine. She was experiencing chest tightness, SOB, and dizziness. 50mg of Benadryl and 20mg of famotidine was administered around 1410. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3mg of epinephrine was administered at 1420. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse ox 100%, HR 68, BP 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care.  Pt seen in Emergency Room 1/16/2021 1513 CHIEF COMPLAINT: reaction to COVID vaccine   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 64y F with PMHx significant for Myopericarditis, Anxiety and HTN who presents to ER after developing tongue swelling, wheezing, tunneled vision and shortness of breath. Patient states that she was getting first shot of COVID19 Pfizer vaccine at 2:00 pm. After getting vaccine she waited 15 minutes like she was told and recalls room getting very hot at approximately 6 minutes after getting vaccine. She also states that her tongue felt swollen. She then noticed her vision started to turn dark and then she felt dizzy. She told pharmacist about symptoms and then she was given one pill of Benadryl. This did not help and actually made her symptoms worse. She recalls wheezing. She was given another pill of what she believes was Benadryl. She also recalls pharmacist measured her BP and her husband, who was present, reported that her blood pressure was in the 140s This did not improve so she was given 0.3mg IM epinephrine shot. This significantly improved her symptoms. However, she was sent to ER.  She denies any hx of recent UTI or GI infection. She denies fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, generalized itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized swelling, headache or syncopal episode. She denies any past reactions to vaccines. She denies current SOB and feels like her symptoms resolved. Denies hx of COPD or asthma. Physical exam did not show any recurrent signs of wheezing or tongue edema. Her SaO2 was 100% on RA and BP was within baseline 140-160s. Given episode, we decided to obtain tryptase levels. We also observe patient to ensure she did not have any recurrence of symptoms. She remained hemodynamically stable and SaO2 remained in mid 90s to 100. She was given a rx for epinephrine pen should symptoms recur though this is highly unlikely as she remained stable throughout ER stay. She was also given instructions to pick up OTC Benadryl and Pepcid. She does have antihistamines listed as an allergy but patient states that she gets tachycardic upon taking tabs, so this could just be a side effect. We will follow up with tryptase levels but even if tryptase levels return as normal, it does not mean she did not have an anaphylactic reaction to vaccine. Her clinical picture puts this diagnosis high in the differential. Teaching and instructions were given to patient and her husband. She was advised to return to ER if symptoms recur.

A 64-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3248) at single dose via an unknown route at right arm on 16Jan2021 about 11:00 for vaccination against Covid. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. Medical history included anxiety, high blood pressure, and ongoing physical urticaria (with no investigation assessment) where if she gets warm her arms itch and she breaks out in a little bit of hives, but never to this extent. Concomitant drugs included lisinopril at 20mg, 1 tablet by mouth once daily for high blood pressure, and sertraline at 50mg, 1 tablet by mouth once daily for anxiety, both ongoing. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was reported as &#34;none&#34;. No other vaccines given the same day and none 4 weeks prior. No history of problems with vaccines in past. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine was &#34;none&#34;. No events following prior vaccinations. Family medical history relevant to the event was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Patient reported an adverse event/side effect to the Covid vaccine, and was not sure if she should go ahead with the second dose or not. Patient received the vaccine on 16Jan2021 (reported as Saturday as of 18Jan2021) about 11am and at 5pm she started getting a warm feeling and changed to cooler clothing. Patient started itching and then broke out in hives on her face, arms, and chest. Patient used a cool cloth to face to cool off and sat under the fan. Her daughter got her some diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) within that 15minutes and about 20-30 minutes of taking the diphenhydramine hydrochloride it was calming down. Patient only took 1 diphenhydramine hydrochloride to help and that took care of it. This was the only occurrence. Her face was really swollen and red, she looked like she was sun burnt, skin was blotchy, but she didn&#39;t have any trouble with breathing or heart palpitations. The event onset date was 16Jan2021. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room/ Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Outcome of the events was resolving.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had my 2nd dose of covid vaccine on 1/15, around 5 pm.  Next day when I got up about 7:20 I felt dizzy nausea and wanted to vomit.  Then I passed out, I fell down and hit my face on the floor.  My family called 911 paramedica.  They ,measured d my blood pressure and it was too low. The area around my right eyebrow was swollen and my neck hurt as precaution I went to the hospital.  I suspect the incident and its symptom are side effects of the vaccine given the timing.  Later on I had headache off and on and brain fog.

                                                This 64 year old female experienced an adverse event. At baseline, she presented in a wheelchair. Within 5 minutes after vaccination, she complained of a racing heart, a new onset tremor of hands and head, and slurred/stuttering speech.  She denied chest pain, shortness of breath or itching.  No facial droop or one-sided weakness was observed.  The patient had a history of hypertension and history of an adverse reaction to albuterol in November 2020.   The patient described being nervous to get the vaccine due to her previous reaction to alberterol which had the similar effects as today&#39;s.    The patient&#39;s new tremor worsened, and speech became more slurred and stuttered while we observed her.  The patient denied any pain and described a similar event that caused her to be hospitalized for a week with no definitive diagnosis.  Her primary care doctor had cleared her to get the vaccine.    Her Vitals were as follows: BP 160/90. HR 65, RR 20. Heart sounds were regular with occasional PVC&#39;s. Lung sounds were clear No visible rash on neck, trunk or injection site. Capillary refill was normal.  Mild edema in both lower extremities. No swelling of the lips. No visible droop in facial muscles. Patient was tearful and struggled to speak.  She repeatedly said she was tired.  She reported nausea.  EMT was called and found similar vitals and O2 saturation at 100% on room air by pulse ox.  O2 via nasal canula was begun.  Rhythm strip showed NSR.  Patient refused transport to the hospital for further evaluation.  She was informed of a possible Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) could be occurring which could need a blood thinner and further work up.    Patient was tearful saying her previous hospitalization was traumatic and did not want to return.  EMS offered her transport to another hospital facility via private vehicle, and she refused.  We offered to contact her primary care doctor and she also refused.  She was concerned about the cost of a hospital stay if she signed out AMA.  EMS left the facility and offered to return if the patient changed her mind.  The patient&#39;s symptoms had not resolved by 4:30pm.  The patient&#39;s son, by phone, confirmed she would be monitored until 5pm.   She was driven home by one of our staffers. The next day, the patient told our staffer that she felt well. She said it took about 7 hours for her speech to return. She said her head, stomach and body felt better in the morning. She said she going to see an allergist as her doctor recommended.   Our presumed diagnosis was a TIA related to uncontrolled HTN with anxiety.

Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (one is patient). A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6204), intramuscular, administered in right arm on 08Mar2021 14:10 (at the age of 64-year-old) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high cholesterol, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, arthritis, stenosis of neck and spine, allergies to dust and cleaners (when she cleans, the bottom of her neck swells up huge); all were ongoing. She has very high cholesterol, she believes it was close to 400 the last time it was checked and that&#39;s why she was given Repatha which brought it way down, but she doesn&#39;t know if she can take the Repatha again. She also has quite a few allergies - allergic to cats, sulfa, grass and Pre-diabetes. She has a fair amount of allergies. Her doctor thinks she has some asthma because she has had a little trouble breathing at different times, but she doesn&#39;t have an inhaler or anything. She mentions asthma and allergies run in her family. The patient also stated that a majority of her life, has had low blood pressure until about 9 years ago when her father passed. States that her blood pressure had been out of control for 6 months and was then put on a low dose of Carvedilol, and eventually evened out. Concomitant medications included ongoing carvedilol taken for blood pressure; ongoing loratadine (CLARITIN) taken for allergies from 1996 (has been taking for 25 years); ongoing lansoprazole taken for acid reflux; ongoing rosuvastatin calcium taken for cholesterol since Sep2020; ongoing calcium; carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure. The patient had a previous reaction to a cholesterol medication evolocumab (REPATHA) from 23Oct2020 to 23Oct2020 - her neck swelled up pretty big and she had hives on her chest, which ended up going away. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if she can take that again or not. The patient also previously took rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) 5-6 months ago and it made her legs ache really bad; esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) and had the problem; lansoprazole (PREVACID) for acid reflux. She took Nexium which was a different product with different ingredients and her blood pressure was still high the whole day. States that her doctor had prescribed another brand, which had the same main ingredient as the Nexium, and told her to double up on it one night, so she did that and about an hour later she just about hit the floor because her blood pressure shot up to about 200 over 100 and something, so she talked to the pharmacist who said that this was not a normal reaction to the ingredients in Nexium, but it happened to her every time she took it. She had been taking Prevacid for a long time but then started to get an allergic reaction. Clarified that feeling like she was having an allergic reaction after taking the Prevacid at night, was something that she has just started noticing within the last month. Wondering if the 2nd dose of the Prevacid is too much. States that she still takes this in the morning but not in the evening. States that she has started taking 15mg at night from an over the counter version of the same medicine (Lansoprazole). She explained that she hasn&#39;t had any vaccines as an adult, she never has had a flu shot. About 5 years ago, she had a bat in the house for 3 days and the bat ended up hitting her in the head and forehead as they were trying to get the bat out of the house, so she ended up getting a rabies vaccine. She was wondering and hoping there were no interactions with that. With the rabies vaccine, she did have a headache. She had to get 4 or 5 shots and she did not feel well most of the time. It took a long time to pass for her to feel normal again. The caller received the first dose of the vaccine last Monday on 08Mar2021, after the shot and while waiting those 30 minutes, she felt a lump in her throat which lasted all day and the next day, but it went away. She confirms by 10Mar2021, she recovered completely. Her arm swelled up and was sore for a day and half on 08Mar2021, but that went away. She isn&#39;t worried about that. She also has a really bad headache and was very dizzy on unspecified dates. She is concerned about the dizziness. She has been driving, but about the second day after getting the vaccine, she was leaning over talking to her mom and she felt like she going to pass out. She didn&#39;t, but she felt like she was. She has been using hot packs. It&#39;s like she has a headache around her temples and the back of her head seems to be hurting. In fact, she put a hot pack there while waiting to speak to this call handler. She doesn&#39;t know if its tension or what. She didn&#39;t have hives or none of that from COVID vaccine which she was excited about, but she is so dizzy she can hardly stand. She can&#39;t get rid of the headache and dizziness. She wants to know whether or not to go ahead with the next vaccination. This is the 5th day of having this dizziness. She was thinking the dizziness was going to last for a couple of days, but its going on 5 days. Even just sitting, She states it&#39;s kind of scaring her. She was thinking it would just go away, but it isn&#39;t. Her heart rate and blood pressure seemed to be very erratic on 12Mar2021. She woke up this morning (12Mar2021) and her blood pressure was very high, but she checked it within a few minutes and was dropping low. Her heart goes fast and then slows down, but she has had problems with this in the past. The dizziness has been bothering her a lot, she has been afraid to drive. The patient had a blood pressure of 150/102 on unspecified date.  On 17Mar2021, She mentioned she will see her HCP at 2:00 PM. She has already filed a report regarding the side effects she had. She filed a report and asked if she should get the second dose shot. However, she was informed if her HCP called, they may be able to provide her with more information. She was informed her HCP could call the medical line. On 26Mar2021, she stated that the first report was filed the first week and that during the second week, more not good things have been happening. She wrote down the report number from the first report but does not have it now. Since the vaccine, she has been having different symptoms; she is not sure if it is related to the vaccine but wanted to report it. She was a little concerned because she has allergies, stating she had just tried an injectable cholesterol drug and she did break out hives and her neck had swelled. States that she has not had any vaccines as an adult, so she was a little bit cautious anyway. She clarified that she did not have hives and did not have any breathing problems when she left. Stated that later that evening and the next day had a really bad headache and bad pressure in the back of her head, which she knew was typical. States that 3 or four times she felt a rush over her body and felt like she was going to pass out. That night and the next day (unspecified date), she was having breathing problems (was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days) and her chest was tight and she was starting to wheeze, and continued for about 3 or 4 days. She kept getting an icky feeling Monday and Friday when she got up and had unwell feeling all over like she was going to pass out on unspecified date in Mar2021. States she had real bad pressure in her head and high blood pressure and felt like her heart was skipping beats on unspecified date. States her blood pressure was around 152/100 on 09Mar2021. One-day blood pressure was real low, 88 over something but that kind of went away. States all that information was already reported. The next week, she thought she was feeling better and that Monday and Tuesday felt back to normal. Stated that on Thursday night (Mar2021), she was just sitting and around 8 o&#39;clock her blood pressure spiked within a few minutes to around 184/105 and she wasn&#39;t doing anything; she couldn&#39;t get it to go down. States that she went to the ER to check everything out last Thursday.  Every night since then, somewhere around 8 o&#39;clock, her blood pressure spikes really high.  Stated she then called her doctor. Stated she was on a really low dose of blood pressure medication, stating that she had occasional problems with her blood pressure in the past but it never went that high. Her blood pressure was usually in the 140&#39;s or 150&#39;s over 90 something. States that now it is much higher and happening every night. Caller stated that Wednesday night (24Mar2021) her blood pressure started to spike every 5 to 6 hours, stating it first started at 830 at night and again at 230 in the morning. She has been feeling unwell since that shot. Her doctor thinks it may be causing inflammation. States that they doubled her medication last night and her blood pressure is still going up and up, but usually goes down after a couple of hours. It is totally uncontrolled and her doctors are trying to figure it out. States that meds have been added, including Xanax and will be going to see a heart doctor. States that this has all been since the vaccine. Caller would like to know if people are reporting these symptoms. States that it is pretty terrible, and that she feels normal and then it rushes over her. States that it is exhausting and that she almost went to the ER last night. States that she does not want to go back if she does not have to. When she filed the first report she did not have issues with blood pressure yet. Again, she had the vaccine on Monday 08Mar2021 and that the next Thursday she felt like her heart rate was really high. During that first week, she felt out of rhythm, like missing beats. Her blood pressure dropped low the first week and that just one time was around 152/100 but it didn&#39;t sustain. It then dropped pretty low one day. The next Thursday, it was uncontrollable. It was around 180 over 104 or 105 and that it kept going up, but then back down to 160/90 something. Took Xanax and went to bed, when she woke up this morning it was low, but went right back up within 5 minutes. In the first couple of days, they increased her blood pressure medicine and it seemed to be bringing her blood pressure down and she was able to go to bed. The caller stated that Monday, it will be three weeks. States that a day and a half after the vaccine, her arm was not hurting but was still puffy, but not bad. States that when she runs her hands over it, it is still sore to the touch and a little swollen but nothing extreme. She was concerned that her blood pressure keeps going up and then down. States that the blood pressure started spiking on the 18Mar2021, in the evening very quickly and was very high. Stated that this was happening every night since then until the 24th, when it started spiking every 5-6 hours; and her blood pressure medicine wasn&#39;t controlling it like it was earlier in the week, even though the dose was doubled. For one day it worked good and brought it down low but then, it wasn&#39;t controlling it anymore. She stated no relevant tests, related to this event but states that in her last 2 labs her cholesterol was high. States that it was over 300 and her bad cholesterol double or more triple. States this has been going on for many years. States that she changed her calcium to calcium with vitamin D and her vitamin has come back up. When she was in the ER they did a Metabolic panel and everything looked okay. The adverse events require and emergency room visit. The patient recovered from the event lump in throat on 10Mar2021; the events arm swelled up and was sore recovered in Mar2021; the events erratic heart rate, chest was tight, was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days, wheezing resolved on unspecified date.

Imaging revealed small diffusion in the left knee with concerns for septic arthritis.  Arthrocentesis with WBC count 35,000, no organisms or crystals.  Labs significant for leukocytosis and elevated CRP and ESR. Pain has progressed to involve multiple joints particularly on the left side.  Given polyarticular involvement, reactive arthritis secondary to immunization verses Crohn&#39;s disease seems likely, although cannot definitively rule out septic arthritis at this time.

A 64-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, at age 64 years, administered in left arm on 05Apr2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8734) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, in order to go back to normal, without a mask so she was told she had to have one. Medical history included hysterectomy, anxiety, disorder in thyroid and cholesterol. Patient had family history of dementia, had to stay home and take care of her mom who is a heart patient and has dementia. Patient had no history of previous immunizations. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes unspecified medications one is for thyroid, one is for cholesterol and the other 2 are for anxiety. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. Patient&#39;s symptoms started with a headache the morning after the shot (05Apr2021), was on and off for a couple of days, lasted 3 days or so for a couple days and she took paracetamol (TYLENOL). On 09Apr2021, Friday morning, patient woke up so nauseous she couldn&#39;t hold anything down. It was just bile coming up, and she had severe diarrhea and so sick vomiting that wouldn&#39;t stop, stomach pain, couldn&#39;t hold her own weight up. She got medication at a walk in clinic and that didn&#39;t stop it. She started out at acute/urgent care, where she was taken by her daughter on Sunday, 11Apr2021, because she was feeling so bad and was tested for COVID and they said if it does not get better to go to the Emergency Room and she continued having problems. It was not COVID. They said she was dehydrated and send her home to push fluids and drink Pedialyte. Monday or Tuesday (Apr2021) she was in the ER all night (she does not remember the day because all of her days are mixed up). They did CAT scans on her abdomen and ran blood work. They didn&#39;t see anything in her abdomen. Her white blood cell count and kidney and liver function were all elevated and they said it was from being dehydrated from diarrhea and vomiting. They gave her fluids and sent her home. Within another 48 hours she still had vomiting and diarrhea, it was a clear bile and a sharp pain in her side. Her stools were dark tarry stringy stuff so she went back to the ER and waited in the lobby for 9 hours. In that 9 hours as she was waiting, she felt like she had to go to the bathroom. She was then wheeled into the bathroom and started passing blood. It wasn&#39;t coming from the urethra. It must have come form the vagina, she doesn&#39;t have a uterus. There were clots. She started passing blood in her urine but most was in the vaginal area but she has already had a hysterectomy. She was passing clots and her doctor who works in the healthcare field looked at it and said they were clots. Very shortly after, she passed the clot and the pain went away.

I began to have an adverse reaction on Friday, 18Dec2020 at 11 PM and then until the Saturday, 19Dec2020 until after dinner I had (Incomplete sentence). You want me to break it down like what the time and what the affect was? Okay 11 PM on Friday 18th my hands swelled up, they were red and they were itchy. I couldn&#39;t get the itching to stop. Hand cream or cold water they finally subsided with cold water and I was able to get sleep. Then I woke up Saturday, 19Dec2020 at 6 AM then was my hands, my feet swollen, red and itchy. Itching was just like, I did not know what to do about it. Used cold water and that rested for about 4 hours. After that stopped I had a rash on my arms, my leg and my abdomen and it just came out of nowhere. It was red like a bubbly rash like a size of pea. You think I looked at I thought what I was going to do. I went I got a cool shower another 4 hours that subsided not completely but enough where it wasn&#39;t scary anymore, it was bearable. Closer to dinner time I had Lymphadenopathy under both arms, red, swollen then I took another 4 to 5 hours to subside. During this I have sore arm that was slightly swollen. The arm was swollen, the shoulder was swollen and the clavicle area was also swollen and that&#39;s my reaction. I work in healthcare and I was just at a point I went to work, I reported the incident and I filed a VARIS report. I talked to my administrator she said I should call Pfizer, let them know. I spoke to my primary doctor, to let him know. I just wanted to report this to someone.&#34;Registered Nurse stated, &#34;My work place. It was offered in &#39;(Name)&#39; hospital (not clarified).&#34; Treatment: Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I took Tylenol.

This consumer reported similar events in two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number and expiry date: not reported), intramuscular on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. Concomitant medication included vitamins nos. It was reported that both the patient and her husband received the Pfizer Vaccine on 10Jan2021; and they had reaction to it. They both both had bad arm swelling and pain. Her was worst she couldn&#39;t even lift or move her arm. At first, they just thought it was a reaction as they read reactions could be and then she started to get small cough but by Friday, her husband went and got tested and on Wednesday he was tested positive and this is after the vaccine and then he got the results and it said he was positive. So, Saturday, they both went and got tested, they did the rapid and they did what they call the PCR, and they both came positive for both of them and this was after they receive the first vaccine. So, she thought they need to know that they got sick and it was after the vaccine. The patient needed to ask a question as they were supposed to go for their second vaccine on 31Jan2021 and do they do it even though they got sick. They knew they were claiming that they can&#39;t get sick because of the vaccine but it&#39;s very ironic that they did get this. They had been following CBC guidelines, both her husband and the patient because they are older and they wear mask all the time and they did everything they needed to and they could not understand how they got this. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Rapid and PCR: positive in Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of &#34;bad arm swelling and pain; worst she couldn&#39;t even lift or move her arm&#34; which included treatment with Tylenol. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021092094 same reporter and drug, similar events in a different patient

                                                About 1/2 hour of the vaccination, I felt mild tingling of the lips.  Very gradually, that got worse (over the nest few hours) and I had tingling of hands and feet.  I gradually developed facial swelling (my lips were enlarged and felt firm, as did my nose).  I checked my pulse ox, and it remained above 97%.  I never had rash or trouble breathing.  But  about 5 hours after receiving the immunization, I took some Benadryl, and over about 1/2 hour I could feel that things were improving.  Over the next 24 hours I took Benadryl again two times, due to return of the tingling sensation of my lips.  I also felt very cold, and had a hard time getting warm.  This also improved with the Benadryl.

                                                Second COVID vaccine on 1/14/21 - The patient is  received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine at Hospital.   Post dose she experienced intermittent sensation of tingling on left posterior neck area with no paresthesia and difficulty lifting bilateral extremities.  Three days after administration of the vaccine she began noticing weakness in her legs that eventually progressed to her arms bilaterally.   She developed pitting edema and SOB.   Per infectious disease MD, the main suspicion is for GBS Guillain-Barre Syndrome given exam findings. Pt&#39;s weakness and resulting inability to ambulate may have pushed pt into CHF exacerbation.   Patient received 3 days of IVIG which was discontinued due to worsening mental status.   Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.

Experienced myalgia  and severe migraine-like headache with light sensitivity. The arm pain from shoulder to mid-palm was so severe that I couldn?t lift my arm. This resolved by approximately noon on 02/10/2021. The other symptoms largely resolved by midday 02/11/2021 wit residual low-grade headache, dizziness, and unsteadiness on my feet.  I woke up on 02/11/2021 around 7AM with left axillary lymphadenopathy approximately the size of a tennis ball cut in half with associated moderate discomfort. The discomfort resolved by 02/14/2021, but the lymphadenopathy remains at about half the mass noticed originally.

                                                On February 11, 2 days after my vaccination, I woke up with pain and swelling under my left eye.  Over the next 2 days, the left side of my face under the eye experienced redness and swelling then subsided and localized into a large stye on the lower left eyelid.  Now,  a week later, the stye is still red and pus filled but has improved and is slowly resolving.   I would not normally think that this affliction had anything to do with getting a vaccine but it does seem strange that something like this could occur in someone who is very healthy and and does not experience any side effects from vaccines.   The last time I had a stye was in my 20&#39;s and it wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as the one I am now experiencing.   Since the Covid vaccine is so new and however unrelated this coincidental affliction seems, I thought I should report it regardless.

On night of 2/3 spread to back ? shot side line of nodes paralleling spine  and shoulder/neck area-  back pain not as severe as original breast area and heat helps to reduce back pain Pain interferes with sleep - 2/4 finally able to get 4 hours sleep ( hot shower temporary relief while showering)( normal is 7 hrs) As of 2/5 still in moderate to severe breast area pain almost continuously. Hope I am recovering but its 10 days and still mostly constant incapacitating pain. Very slight intermittent node pain by Feb 17 when got second shot in other arm per Physician Assistant?s recommendation. So far after 51 hours 2nd shot adverse effects minimal and does not interfere with thinking or sleeping

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

                                                I had injection site discomfort, about 4-6 hours after vaccination. I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

She then had a rash that started on the left side of her neck, went towards the back now.  This started a few days after the vaccine, all on the left side.  She also got a cold sore on her lip which she had all the time as a child, but not as an adult, which has pretty much resolved.  She has been cold, chills and some dizzy spells.  She did get a bump on her head concussion in December.  One day last week she just stayed on the sofa with a blanket due to feeling poorly.  3 days ago on her back by her shoulder blade an area has been really sore.  She did take some Tylenol for the back pain which did not help so she stopped this.   She did not call her doctor.    The rash is still there but not as intense.  It has not itched, but she has felt it.

A 65-year-old female patient (weight: 77.56 kg, height: 157 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the upper left arm, on 23Jan2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included thyroid condition from an unspecified date (over 25-30 years before this report) and ongoing, controlled with levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); and breast cancer from an unspecified date, in 2019 (treatment and surgery on an unspecified date, in 2019. Presumed resolved with radiation treatment, but no treatment within a year prior to getting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously, on 05Jan2021 (18 days before the second dose), received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. After the first dose, the patient experienced localized discomfort at the injection site and swelling of feet. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing, 0.88 mg, daily, for thyroid condition. On 23Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site discomfort described as &#34;localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given&#34;. On 24Jan2021, she had dull minor headache. On an unspecified date, the patient was hospitalized after the second dose and was diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome. She clarified that May-Thurner syndrome was where the iliac artery collapses and crushed the iliac vein in the upper abdomen; from that point down it started creating a blood clot. She developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from her left ankle up to her right rib cage area; it was a monster. On 10Feb2021, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis and thrombectomy was performed on the same day (outpatient thrombectomy surgery, performed 10Feb2021. It was a great surgery, very corrective. She never did have any pain or discomfort which confused everyone. She felt fine this whole time, no issues). On an unspecified date, both of her feet were only slightly swollen. Relevant laboratory test, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included computerised tomogram (CT scan with contrast of her abdomen and chest) that showed deep vein thrombosis: left ankle-right ribcage area. The adverse events May-Thurner syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were assessed as serious, hospitalization required from 02Feb2021 to 10Feb2021. The patient recovered from deep vein thrombosis on 10Feb2021, recovered from headache on 26Jan2021, recovered from swelling of feet and vaccination site discomfort on an unspecified date, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown. Her vascular surgeon said he did not believe these events were vaccine related but cannot rule it out; her Primary Care Physician absolutely believed the events were vaccine related.   The information on the lot number has been requested.

I called my primary care doctor&#39;s office and was told by the receptionist that this was a reaction to the vaccine and should subside in a few days and if not to call back.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number RM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at the 65 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included Muscular dystrophy. The concomitant medications included unspecified multiple medications. The patient received the first dose on 03Feb2021. Immediately after the vaccine on 03Feb2021 she had an anaphylactic reaction, received an Epipen, went to the ER was given steroids and sent home. Next day, still having symptoms, received second Epipen administration, went to Urgent Care, was admitted to hospital 04Feb2021. The patient stated she had a history of muscular dystrophy. She stated she was having issues breathing, swallowing, weakness, unable to take anything by mouth, didn&#39;t have normal respiratory support in Feb2021. It had affected her lungs, gut, muscles, everything. She may leave here on hospice. She wanted to know if there were others who had reported side effects such as hers.  She had anaphylactic reaction to the mineral. She was still in the hospital. She had lost ability to swallow and she was still having lung issues in Feb2021. She was a disabled rehab healthcare worker. She did not have an address right now in the hospital but if sent her something later once she get out she will be able to do that but she did not have it now. She takes multiple medications. Right now she cannot take medications she need orally. She had gone to hospital getting meds via primarily IV. She had acute anaphylactic reaction immediately after the vaccine and went by ambulance to hospital and was given steroids, care basically and sent home and she still had issues the next day and it kept going from home to urgent care to admission at the hospital. She had done lot of lab tests in Feb2021. She was very concerned that this was not going to be a temporary issue. She had form of muscular dystrophy and now what was happening was the week before she got the vaccine totally independent in her home, feeling ok, medications okay and now she was at IV medications not being able to swallow. She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated. It was going to take a while to stop the efficacy again and having to be on the phone everyday when she was barely breathing. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Lab test unknown result in Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                The minute I stood up after vaccine, I was very dizzy and my heart started pounding. Then I got nausea.  Was sent to Urgent Care office where I got EKG, which showed no problems with my heart. Went home, weak.  Woke at 2:00 am with night sweats. When I got up I noticed swelling on face, throat, hands &amp; feet. Faint pink rash ran up both fore arms and I had welts rising on my wrists. Nurse line I called said to to to ER asap, Took me a few hours to find a ride, my throat was closing up more by that point. I could tell over a few hours that my throat was swelling up. Went to nearest ER where I was very mentally confused. They  gave me a shot of steroids and Benedryl.  Later that night I got chills and was VERY weak. Had night sweats again. After a few days of rest, am still weak.

                                                No side effects were experienced until 2 days after I received the vaccine.  Two days after I received the vaccine I experienced enlarged lymph nodes on the left side of my back. I experienced pain when I pressed on my back. The pain felt like sore muscles so I used a heating pad which did not alleviate the issue. The enlarged lymph nodes continued to increase to include pain from my left arm pit down my left arm to my forearm and shoulder blade. It also increased down my back into my left buttock and upper thigh. As of today, March 16, 2021 at 3pm, the pain has slightly decreased.

Friday 10/19, slight sore arm, no headache. Around 7pm felt sore right nipple. Upon examination it appears to be a small 2mm cyst-like bump -- white, round, mildly painful, a bit itchy. Inside of right breast felt itchy and became rash like red when rubbed/scratched to relieve irritation.  Saturday 10/20 Noon, right nipple still sore and a bit itchy, bump still there, rash from rubbing night before has  subsided some but still there. No recurrence of headache, pain in arm at injection site or sore lymph node on right neck.  Have not consulted with a medical professional but will do so if condition persists on Monday.

Friday I felt no better - by evening I felt swelling in my neck and chest area. Noticeable swelling in clavicle area on both sides. Saturday &amp; Sunday I rode it out until I could see my Dr. on Monday March 22. Dr. gave me a shot of steroids and a script for MethylPREDNISolone - 21 tablets. Today is Tuesday, March 23, 2021 and I feel much, much better. Dr. said to NOT get the 2nd shot and to report this reaction.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration first dose on 07Mar2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included allergy history to a of number of medication and things (I&#39;m prone to allergies). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  On 07Mar2021, the patient received the first dose and she went to sit in the observation area for 5 minutes. The patient was not anxious at all about getting it but she started having a rapid heart rate/ bounding rapid heart beat and SOB/shortness of breath that lasted about a minute. The EMT checked her out and asked her to stay longer and she did and after about 5 more minutes the same thing happened again. These episodes lasted about 1 minute and she had dizziness with it. Also she did not have any further episodes and she stayed a long time. Her concern was whether this was indicative of an allergic reaction and should she still get the second dose. The patient was asking for information about 2nd dose being given after 42 days. The patient stated that she has not had any more of those symptoms at all. The patient arm was sore and swollen that was all now. The events heart rate increased, dyspnea, pain in extremity, and peripheral swelling was assessed by the reporter as serious (medically significant). The outcome of the events heart rate increased, dyspnea, and dizziness was recovered and unknown for the remaining events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Severe pain on left side of chest, left breast and pain radiating over shoulder to back on left side. On scale of 1-10, the pain was a 9. Extreme heaviness on both sides of chest. I could breath but seemed difficult to take deep breaths. Took an extra dose of my blood pressure meds and it eased the pain to a 4-5 and I was finally able to sleep at 1:00 AM.  Starting on March 8, 2021 I began having severe night sweats and continue to have them at present (March 25, 2021). Dr does not recommend that I take the second vaccination due to my reaction to the first one. He did recommend that I take the Johnson &amp; Johnson but the health department is stating that I have to complete my vaccinations with the same on I started with. I will not have the second Pfizer.

                                                On  March 19 around 8 pm my lymph nodes under my arm started swelling and were very painful. They stayed like that for for 3 days before starting to go down.. The injection hurt when it was given. The  first dose given in my left arm did not hurt 2/22/202. My lymph nodes in my neck swelled a little, but never caused  pain.  I had a mammogram on 3/18 and a place on my left breast/ lymph node has shown that it  could be malignant , but I have to go for more tests to check it out. I have since read about this happening after the Covid 19  vaccine.  The nurses at hospital said to report things like this since the vaccine is still so new, to help know what is happening. So that?s why wam. Thank you!

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: Jun2021), as single dose in left shoulder on 04Mar2021 at noon for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from May2012 and ongoing (autoimmune condition), ongoing undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) (autoimmune condition, unsure when diagnosed, started with polymyalgia rheumatica, then it went to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), then it went between Lupus and undifferentiated connective tissue disease), hospitalization: she had to go hospital twice in last 4 months, one was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril as another blood pressure medication, she had 2 mild anaphylactic reactions in the last 4 months from amlodipine and Lisinopril, patient thought they all have PEG in the ingredients; underwent colonoscopy unknown results. There were no concomitant medications.

Course of events was as follows: The patient drove two hours to get the vaccine. The patient was vaccinated on 04Mar2021 at noon. The reaction started immediately, the caller had a severe headache within seconds, a little bit of sensation in her chest. The patient&#39;s thoughts were getting mixed up, she was not thinking clearly. This was one of first things that happened. The patient stumbled a little bit and the nurses were there around her and said she better sit down now. Then the sensation in her throat was starting to feel like it was closing up, her lips were swollen; so she would say she was a little bit confused. The patient started getting dizzy and her thinking was not clear, her tongue swelled, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, she was gasping for air, she needed a moment to regulate her breathing. In regards to swollen lips she added at first she had a tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips, restriction in her throat, then she started slurring her words before the ambulance got there.  On site they responded and watched her because she did not know if the symptoms were going to get worse. The paramedics gave the caller oxygen and an IV, since she had a mild experience she wanted to see what she did not take any medications before taking the vaccine so she could see what it would do, she did not take an ibuprofen or Tylenol. Patient commented, she knew it was not recommended, but some people do it. The patient mentioned started speaking very badly and very fast, she started gulping for air, and was informed the histamines are hitting her.  She felt like she was going to faint, she thought if she was able to count back from ten she was going to be knocked out. Once she counted back she started to feel better. Like she would not faint. She did not faint often. She mentioned counting backwards from ten when getting a colonoscopy or something like don&#39;t get passed five and then knocked out, so she knows the sensation that can occur.

The patient has been looking around and she thought this reaction it was from the polyethylene glycol. She mentioned historically she had a minor reaction. She had to go hospital twice in last four months. One was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril which is another blood pressure medication. She confirmed she visited the emergency room for all 3 of these cases. The patient was still very confused on 09Mar2021 and over the weekend, she had to rest, she was weak and fatigued.

The swelling in throat created an infection on unspecified date. She wound up going to the doctor and they prescribed her an antibiotic which cleared the infection in her throat. Her symptoms started two days after she received the shot. She is supposed to get the second shot on Thursday 25Mar2021 and that&#39;s why she is calling to find out information on what other people reported as far as asthma patients. She is debating on getting the second shot. Initially caller states that for the most part, it cleared up and went away about three days ago, but then explains it is gradually getting better. Every once in a while, her throat feels dry and raw, but she drinks water and it feels better. At first, she did not want to really talk. She has asthma, the congestion never really goes away and it didn&#39;t really improve this time after prednisone like it usually does. She did not feel good on Friday, but on Saturday it got bad. Her side effects have improved from what they were then. The patient recovered from the event swelling in throat created an infection on unspecified date. The outcome of got pretty sick and throat feels dry was unknown and the outcome of the remaining events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Swelling in face at temples where I had filler a year ago; right eye area swelled up more until eye was almost closed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 66-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: El3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Illness at vaccine included urinary tract infection from Jan2021 and ongoing. Medical history included face at temples where she had filler a year before (in 2019). Concomitant medication included nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infection from 04Jan2021 to 11Jan2021. The patient had historically gotten shingles vaccine, flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine and never had any problems. The patient experienced swelling in face at temples where she had filler a year before (in 2019) and right eye area swelled up more until eye was almost closed on 10Jan2020 17:00. This consumer had the bnt162b2 on 10Jan2021 at about 12:30pm. On 10Jan2021 around 4:00 pm (reported as &#34;10Jan2020 05:00 pm&#34;) she noticed the areas around her temples and under eyes where she had filler placed last year swelled up quite a bit. She read up on this and saw to take antihistamines or oral steroids for this, so she took antihistamines and the event improved, was much better through during the day yesterday (11Jan2021). Last night (11Jan2021) her right eye area swelled up more until eye was almost closed; in response to that event she has been icing the area and the event has improved, swelling come down quite a bit but still ongoing. She called her primary care physician about this event and is waiting for a callback from them about getting a steroid pack. She already reported this information on an unknown Pfizer website online, and also on the VAERS reporting online site today (12Jan2021); but does not have any reference numbers from those reports to provide at this time. She called to ask for information on how to proceed regarding this event; if this has been reported with bnt162b2; if there would be problems with her getting the second dose of bnt162b2 as scheduled on 31Jan2021 because she heard the second dose would be worse. She also noted during this report that she was still taking nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infection when she received that first dose of bnt162b2; she asked if that could have any correlation with event or be a problem taken together. She reported by the time she got that first dose the urinary tract infection itself was gone. Caller verified that she received no other vaccines on the date of first dose of bnt162b2 and onset of adverse event. She verified that she had not received any other vaccines in the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of bnt162b2 and onset of adverse event. She verified that she has no history of any adverse events with any other vaccines. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                After receiving the 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine on Sunday  morning, Feb. 14, my left underarm began to hurt in the evening.  I was tired that day but no other symptoms.  Through the night I had chills and sweats.  In the morning there was a large lump in my left underarm.  Swollen lymph glands about 3 inches wide and 2 inches deep.  This has continued through Monday and now Tuesday morning it is the same.  No sign of it growing larger or smaller.

                                                Two days after the injection I began to have deep pain in my left side axilliary lymph nodes. It felt like a stabbing pain in the front part of my underarm. Over a week the pain has continued at the same level and gradually continued to spread through my underarm area.  Today (with 10 days of reaction) I continue to have pain. Sometimes if feels like stinging.

A couple of days after that right leg started to swell and was warm. Went to ER on 1/29/2021 and had doppler which showed blood clots from groin area to below the knee. I was placed on Xarelto at that time. Got 2nd dose and about 24 hours latter back of thighs started to hurt again. Called doctor and applied heat and elevation and had no new swelling but I remain on Xeralto. Not sure if it was related but I have had no history of blood clots. 2 years previously broke my right patella and was with brace and no weight bearing for about 8 weeks and brace for 12 weeks without clot issues. Traveled by car a couple  thousand miles last year and no issues.

Due to the surgery I developed lymphedema and i have to wear a compression sleeve and glove seven days a week.  A few minutes after the injection i was reading the reaction list and caught that it might cause lymph nodes to swell and about the time i was reading it i felt pressure in left arm i looked at it my arm and hand swelled  to the point my hand and fingers turned blue i started to massage my arm and called the nurse she told to keep massaging after 30 minutes sitting there the arm was still swelled the nurse released me and told me if it got worse go to the emergency room. I came home kept massaging and elevated my arm about the time i went to bed around 9:00pm the swelling came down. The arm was normal when i woke up

She rates it a 6 out of 10, 10 being severe pain. She has been taking Ibuprofen 800mg TID although she has not contacted her PCP. I recommended that she did. Her 2nd shot is due 3/17 and wonders if it would get worse or if she should get it at all. She thanked me for my call back and I informed her to call us back if she has any questions or issues.

A couple of days later, the pain continued over to my right side also and same difficulty getting a deep breath. For awhile, the pain was in my right armpit too. Put warm compresses on areas and it helped a bit. My sister looked up info on the internet and found that ?Aleve? might help the pain, which it did. Called the  doctor?s office and they were not very helpful. The information my sister got from the internet was of more help. The difficulty getting a deep breath lasted 2 weeks.

                                                Morning after 1st shot awoke with sore back and neck. Appeared swollen like inflammatory response to shot as day of shot felt fine. I did go to Physical Therapy that morning for knee but didn&#39;t do anything out of the ordinary since had been doing that for weeks.  That night was in so much pain couldn&#39;t get into bed. Pain  radiated from back to hip to thigh, and down shin, with no feeling in shin. Muscles very tight and was very odd. Seen by provider the next day and received Toradol shot. That did not provide relief so went to local ER. X-rays revealed pinched nerve. Now maybe that was because of the  inflammatory  response or pure dumb luck. Still in lot pain and will receive cortisone shot next week 10 days after 2nd dose today.  Providers feel not related, but one provider said if my back was inflamed even a simple reaching for glass in cupboard could pinch nerve. I was not going to report but then saw someone posted on (social media) had muscle pain and spasms which sounded like what I had. I believe my inflammatory response to shot drove me to the pinched nerve situation. Been in pain for weeks and had to go to 2nd shot in wheelchair.

Some of the swelling went down during the night but came back the following day.  The swelling continued without any improvement and I started wearing compression socks on the 5th. day. (3-18)  I should have started sooner but I was hoping the swelling would go away on its home.  I have had some minor swelling in both feet at various times in the past 3 months due to some minor sprains and also because of limited movement due to my back injury.  The compression socks help keep the swelling down and I do not know how long I will need to use them.

The pain moved from left to right in the throat. Also and worse: swollen mouth tissue and gums: agonizing. Lymph nodes in neck very sensitive to touch.  *****This was strange because at the beginning of the pandemic, I had these same symptoms three times: March 10, March 22, and April 28. I had a Covid test after 3rd time and it was negative. Consulted with doc, could not go to office for swab of throat because might be Covid. Had Covid test, negative. Started Amoxicillin for one week. Am feeling better.

                                                Today at about 11: 30 AM, I took an Amoxicillin for gingival irritation. I have taken this medicine before , but this was the first time since getting my Covid Vaccine. About one hour later, I began having intense itching of both hands, followed by diffuse flushing and pruritus and slight swelling around my face and eyes and a little feeling of throat irritation, but without SOB, wheezing or tongue swelling. My vital signs stayed stable, including a normal oximeter reading.  I took a 180 mg  Fexofenidine and used some OTC Hydrocortisone Cream on my hands when the first symptoms started. When the other symptoms progressed , I took 24 mg Methylprednisolone oral tablets and 25 mg liquid Diphenhydramine and my husband drove me to the ER, to be close in case I developed difficulty breathing.  After about 30 minutes the symptoms stopped worsening and gradually resolved. I didn&#39;t go to ER

A 66-years-old (non-pregnant) female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3302, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy from 2006 and ongoing, since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer in 2006 and burning mouth syndrome. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had other medications in two weeks which included unspecified dietary supplements. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took doxycycline from 2010 to an unknown date for Lyme&#39;s diseaseand experienced burning mouth syndrome. On 11Mar2021 at 02:00 PM, patient had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. These symptoms still continue. Patient stated that people were talking about the second dose being worse. Patient stated that some of the reactions in Mar2021 look like an allergic reaction. They (HCP) only have cautioned the patient about difficulty breathing in Mar2021. They were saying there wasn&#39;t anything they can do for it. Patient asked how long the side effects will last and how to go about changing the appointment. If they are going to continue, patient was very concerned about following up with the second shot and asked if they can have that second shot be postponed until patient was not experiencing these side effects to the effect that she was. She completed the self-reporting on Monday (15Mar2021), but because her side effects were not going away she wanted to reach out to someone. She has reached out to her practitioner and had an appointment yesterday. Doctors didn&#39;t really know because it was all very new. She had the first vaccination shot on 11Mar2021, almost a week ago. In the 15 minutes that she waited afterwards she definitely experienced palpitations and a feeling of lightheadedness. She has an underlying condition of burning and pain called neuropathy. She has had neuropathy since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer. This exacerbated that. She had been very concerned about that prior. Everyone said and the CDC recommends even with neuropathy to go ahead with the vaccine. It also triggered another underlying condition. She had a reaction to a course of Doxycycline in 2010 for Lyme&#39;s disease that caused burning mouth syndrome. Both of these things were really acute now, the neuropathy and burning mouth syndrome. Monday (15Mar2021) was a particularly bad day because the symptoms of an allergy which were swelling of the face and throat, fast heart beat, and dizziness were with the burning mouth syndrome. She didn&#39;t have difficulty breathing. It was the nerve endings of the tongue that go all the way to the back of her throat and gave the sensation of the whole mouth being involved. Monday was difficult. It was 8 hours of an acute episode then it eased off a little that evening. She had no appetite on Monday and barely ate anything. Yesterday was ok and much better although she was being triggered by environmental thing such as food and toothpaste. Things she normally uses were setting it off. She had an acute reaction this morning to a protein shake she has had every day for 14 years. The reaction this morning, 17Mar2021, was a drop in blood pressure and palpitations. It passed. She has been documenting this and made her provider aware of what she was experiencing. She was participating in the V-Safe through the CDC that checks up on her everyday and asks about symptoms. She didn&#39;t know if she was supposed to report this to the vaccine adverse event system or not. Obviously, she didn&#39;t want to get COVID. She was struggling with the recommendation to get second shot because she was extremely concerned. She wanted to know how long will the side effects will last and if she can postpone getting the second shot until she gets reasonably well. No practitioner can recommend whether to do it or not to do it. She reported this information online to Pfizer on 15Mar2021. She provided the lot number when she reported it online. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. No treatments received from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The patient recovered with lasting effects from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The outcome of the other reported events was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12Mar2021 10:30 (at the age of 66-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The vaccination facility type was a health clinic. The vaccine was not administered at a facility. The patient had no additional administered vaccines. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Medical history included ongoing seizures from 1982 (began shortly after she had the surgery for her brain aneurysm (in 1982 to 1982). The patient had not had any seizure activity for 20 years before the seizures that occurred on 13Mar2021. Sometimes electrical activity in the brain hits the metal clamp used to treat the brain aneurysm and that triggers the seizures); migraines (suffered from migraines when she was younger but hasn&#39;t had one in umpteen years. The patient gets tension headaches like most people but not very often); shingles (patient had shingles three times. Patient&#39;s first case of shingles was in the early 1990&#39;s and that patient had recurrences in the mid 1990&#39;s and the early 2000&#39;s. The first incidence was the worst and that the second and third occurrences weren&#39;t nearly as bad as the first); blood pressure high; ongoing cholesterol; ongoing headache (tension headaches) and was adopted. Family history included migraines with grandkids, a couple of them had migraines and had MRI&#39;s she&#39;d had a sister that was 6 years older than her that had died of a brain aneurysm. Concomitant medications included levetiracetam (KEPPRA) for seizures from an unspecified date (in the late 90&#39;s) to an unspecified date then from Mar2021 and ongoing; nadolol for headache from 2001 and ongoing; lovastatin for cholesterol from an unspecified date (been on it for a long time) and ongoing and on a low dose of medication for high blood. The patient had the Pfizer vaccine first shot on Friday (12Mar2021). The husband stated his wife (patient) had a possible side effect to the vaccine shot and was concerned with getting the second dose of Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine. She had 2 seizures the next morning after the shot (on 13Mar2021) which she hasn&#39;t had in 20 years. The patient experienced her first seizure about 11:00 on 13Mar2021. It took the patient about 45 minutes to come out of the first one completely, until she was conscious again. The second seizure occurred about 13:00 on 13Mar2021, about an hour and a half after the patient recovered from the first seizure. fter the second seizure, the fire department was called and she was transported to the Emergency Room. The doctor told the husband that it was up to them if they wanted to receive the second dose. The husband stated, &#34;I know there is something out there that I heard about where you can disqualify yourself from getting the vaccine for medical reasons.&#34; Also on 13Mar2021, the patient&#39;s tongue hurts in the Emergency Room, no one was willing to give her a new tongue after she bit it. The patient&#39;s tongue was what hurt&#39;s the most, but that it was slowly healing.

The patient received first dose of Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and developed numbness of the right side of her face from her jaw to her ear and up to her right eye on 26Feb2021.  It felt like she had received a lidocaine injection.  Her doctor said this can happen with RNA vaccines, affect the 7th cranial nerve and develop Bell&#39;s Palsy.  She was prescribed Valacyclovir 1mg and has taken it for 3 days.  She wants to know what the other Bell&#39;s Palsy cases were like. She wants to know what their treatments were. Her doctor said it was okay to receive her second dose at 8am on 20Mar2021 but she wants to do her due diligence and see if there is a case report or study on these patients that developed this side effect. The patient further explained that she had her first dose on 26Feb2021 and was she was there for the 15 minutes for observation. On her way home, the right side of her mouth and the right side of her nostril were numb like Novocaine that you get at the dentist. She said that the numbness traveled up the right side of her jaw to her ear and then over to her right eye. When she got home, she told her daughter and she said that she thought it was because she volunteered all day and was worn out and anxious (26Feb2021). She said that she slammed water and ate crackers and after about a 1.5 hours she started to feel better. She said that she then she called her physician and the doctor told her that it was flaring the nerve root like bells palsy and that it is a RNA Virus. She said that she was placed on some medication for it, but was wondering if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. She said that the doctor asked her if she had previously had cold sores and she said yes. The caller said that her doctor said that it is exactly what that is. The patient stated that she was also short of breath on an unspecified date, but thought it was from fear and anxiousness. She does not know if it was from fear and anxiety or from the vaccine. She said that the doctor told her to take the medication 3 days before and 3 days after her second dose. She clarified that the doctor put her on Valacyclovir HCl 1Gm tablets 1 a day. She said that she broke out with fever blisters on 02Mar2021. She really did not think anything of it until speaking with friends in the medical field and they told her to follow up with this. She added that the fever blisters are healing and only a tiny bit left. It is at the scab and end of healing. Outcome of numbness of the right side of her face from her jaw to her ear and up to her right eye was recovered on 26Feb2021. Outcome of fever blisters was recovering.

She showed a nurse practitioner her hand and nurse practitioner said patient needs to report that. Patient states it swells right under her finger, swelling under her middle and ring finger. The joint went stiff and the pain. She can&#39;t bend her fingers, it is mostly her ring finger. She couldn&#39;t straighten it out or bend it all the way down, it was like it was locked. Following her second vaccine dose she has had pain in the center of the palms of her hands and bottom of her feet. The pain is inconsistent as it comes and goes. The feet pain come and go not bad like the hands. The middle of the palm pain comes and goes and the joint on 1 finger never did get better, it is worse at night and a teeny bit better in the morning. She felt pain in 1 of her feet for a moment yesterday and not continuous like her hand. The left hand is not swelling, the center of her palm has a weird feeling, states she has never had shingles before but imagines that is what the palm of her hand would feel like, it is an achy pain. States she kept telling her husband she has pain in the center of her hands and on the bottoms of her feet and feels like she is about to have a break out and didn&#39;t. Patient states it has been a month since she had the 2nd vaccine. States the symptoms all started within 24 hours of the 2nd vaccine. On 07Apr2021, nurse practitioner put a lubricant injection (name unknown) into her hand where the swelling was. Patient was told it was a lubricant that might help, and it has helped some. It is moving a little better today after the injection but she still has pain. Adverse events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event &#34;swells right under her finger&#34; and included lubricant injection. The outcome of swells right under her finger, joint stiffness, and joint lock was recovering; other events were not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A currently 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 02Mar2021 16:00 (also reported as 16:30) (Batch/Lot Number: Unknown) as 2nd dose, single dose (at the age of 66-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included bell&#39;s palsy from 07Jan2015; and an unspecified risk factor. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient did not have any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient did not have family medical history that was relevant to adverse events and no relevant tests were done. The patient previously took shingles vaccine (Merck) that started with the letter &#39;Z&#39; and had Bell&#39;s Palsy in Jan2015 which was exactly 6 weeks after she got a shingles vaccine; tetanus vaccines 10 years ago as a booster and experienced severe swelling on her arm, swelling in her body; Quadravalent flu vaccine and never had a reaction to the flu vaccines; and the first dose of BNT162B2 (reported as &#39;Pfizer COVID&#39;) for COVID-19 immunisation on 02Feb2021 in the left arm. On 24Apr2021, the patient experienced bell&#39;s palsy. On unspecified dates, the patient experienced fever blisters, ear ache and stress. The events were reported as follows: Her HCP should have the information on the shingles vaccine she got in 2015. When she had bell&#39;s palsy the 1st time in 2015, she had to go to the hospital for a day and a half to rule out everything and the best they found was that she had herpes simplex based on the blood work done at that time and it was what her HCP believed it was at that because it showed she had some kind of virus but neither time she had bell&#39;s palsy did she have seizure or other symptoms other than the ear ache she had this time. The patient got the second dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021 and on 24Apr2021 she went to the emergency room with Bell&#39;s palsy. She can talk better when she holds her mouth. She was out of town when she noticed the symptoms of bell&#39;s palsy the night before on 24Apr2021 and when she got home she then went to the emergency room on 25Apr2021; she could tell something was happening again and it was noticeable and she had an ear ache the day before and her face was drooping. The HCPs swear there was no correlation between the vaccine and bell&#39;s palsy but she found this very coincidental. The patient stated that she would rather get bell&#39;s palsy again than get covid. For treatment, the only thing she has done was to call the HCP to schedule the follow-up visit as directed by the emergency room (ER) HCP; she went to the ER to rule out stroke and they did rule out stroke; states the only other thing she can think of is that she had quite a bit of stress because they put down her dog on Sunday and other than that she had an ear ache at her granddaughter&#39;s track meet on the day before on 24Apr2021 and the emergency room visit was on 25Apr2021. She has had recurrent fever blisters and her HCP has given her a prescription for Valcyclovir and she takes that at the onset of fever blisters and where she gets the fever blisters is constantly on the previous side where she had bell&#39;s palsy and was in the same spot on her left side of her lip. States the Valcyclovir she has was one gram tablets and she takes one when she has a fever blister and one 12 hours later; states she has two prescriptions for the Valcyclovir and they are in orange pharmacy bottles with no lot numbers, expiry dates and NDC numbers and the other prescription for Valcyclovir is also 1 gram and she takes it three times per day now after this outbreak. The patient required a visit to the ER or medical doctor office. The outcome of the events was unknown.

The other reaction, the one I am concerned about is that my bottom lip began to swell. The swelling continued throughout the night, swelling 3x normal size. It began to recede back to normal within 48 hours. Also, my lymph nodes under my right arm ( the injection arm) was very sore for 48 hours as well.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EH9899, reported as &#34;SARS-COV-2 then it says Pfizer EH9899&#34;, expiry date: Unknown), subcutaneous on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization (reported as &#34;To not get COVID 19&#34;). Medical history included hypothyroidism. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 25mcg, once a day for hypothyroidism. The patient got the vaccine last Tuesday (05Jan2021). When she got the vaccine, the gentleman was from military who gave the vaccine. The patient does not believe that he gave it intramuscular (IM), she believed that he gave it &#34;subQ&#34; because she had no muscle tenderness and &#34;skin a 4.5 by 7cm skin reaction&#34;, and it was nowhere near the deltoid muscle. The patient had a high degree of suspicion that he gave it &#34;subQ&#34; (subcutaneous). When asked for the anatomical location of administration, the patient stated that &#34;He gave it on my right arm but it was not into the deltoid, I think he gave it subcutaneously. I am not positive of that but missed the deltoid, it was lower, it was below the deltoid, it was in between the deltoid and the bicep and I am assuming it was subQ because none of my muscles were sore at all after getting the vaccine, accept that big red spot on my arm&#34;. Patient asked &#34;Now my question to you is because I looked through all your literature and I can&#39;t find anything about this&#34;. Since then the skin lesion within a couple of days it was up to about 4.5 to 7cms. It was still about that size however the redness has gone way down, &#34;the not redness&#34;, just pink, the swelling was almost gone. The heat coming out of it was almost gone. The patient mentioned that the actual skin region was much better, it was still about the same size though. Patient was not too worried about that and stated &#34;what am concerned about is what I&#39;ve also have is a low grade temperature elevation and some fatigue. If I got it on 3 O&#39;clock on Tuesday the 5th that would be day 9. Is the 9 days post injection for dose 1 to still have a low grade temperature elevation and some fatigue. Is that acceptable or does that indicate a problem?&#34;. Patient stated the she went to her internist and he had a look at it and he said &#34;I had no idea, he said that they just don&#39;t have experience like this. Do you have a phone number that I can talk to somebody?&#34;. The patient was about 5&#39; 7&#34; (height) and about 175 pounds (weight) approximately. The patient stated that fatigue and temperature elevation started one or two days after the vaccine (Jan2021). Patient reported that she still have it. The fatigue was much less but it was there and low grade temperature elevation was still there. There was no investigation assessment. The patient assessed that the events swelling, redness, skin lesions, temperature and fatigue were related to COVID-19 vaccine, also reported as &#34;Yes, because I never had that before and I am not taking anything now. So, it is like yes. It is definitely because that. The two main symptoms I am asking about are the fatigue and the low grade temperature elevation&#34;. Outcome of the events fatigue and skin lesion, redness, swelling and heat coming out was recovering, for low grade temperature elevation was not recovered.

                                                2/7: By 7:00 pm, I had fever which rose to 102&#43; before midnight.  2/8: Low-grade fever, flu-like feeling, &#34;heavy head&#34;, lethargic  2/9-2/10: Pretty much back to normal with the addition of an injection site &#34;hot spot&#34;- raised, rashy and feverish 2/11: Began feeling general malaise in the afternoon. Low grade fever, pain behind collarbone on both sides. By 7pm, severe chills.  2/12: Called PCP and advised of symptoms. Went and got a Covid19 PCR test just in case. Negative 2/13-2/15: Still had low-grade fever (usually around 100*) which often didn&#39;t present until 2pm and then stayed until bedtime. Glands became swollen, bad night sweats. Pain behind collarbone worse when sneezing, coughing, yawning, burping, etc. Additional information for Item 18: Almost like a &#34;catch&#34; rather than constant pain. 2/16: Went to local medical center for drive-thru rapid Covid 19 and flu test. Both came back negative as did the PCR Covid test they also ran.  2/17-2/20: Symptoms pretty much the same....no fever in the am and thought I was finally getting better, then it would spike again around 1:00-2:00. Never over 101*. On the morning of 2/21, the &#34;catch&#34; around the collarbone had moved down to the bottom of my ribcage.  2/22: Contacted PCP again and made appointment for bloodwork, chest x-ray, and further tests. &#34;Sick and tired of feeling sick and tired!&#34;

Then I started to have tightness in my chest and used my albuterol inhaler.   I was still having symptoms an hour later so took Benadryl 25 mg.  During the night I woke up with mild wheezing and used my inhaler again.  Throughout the next 2 days, I continued to have these symptoms (except for wheezing) off and on.  Today, I still have some symptoms but not as often or severe.

                                                Four days after, I noticed a soft &#34;lump&#34; right axilla. Cancer Institute did an ultrasound.  &#34;No enlarged lymph nodes.&#34; No sign of cancer The lump in my axilla got very large. &#34;Not as big as a baseball but larger than a golf ball.&#34; I could wrap my fingers around it. Hard as a rock. Within a week my whole entire chest wall on the right (from side to sternum) was scarlet red. And I was getting another &#34;lump&#34; in the fold of tissue where my upper chest meets my upper arm.  I was put on Keflex 500 mg four times a day.   The redness in my chest wall subsided. Five days after being on Keflex, the lump on my chest was hard, red, very painful, &#34;angry.&#34; Fevers, feeling &#34;pretty sick.&#34; (Very uncharacteristic of me. I didn&#39;t miss a day of work through months of multiple rounds of chemo, 5 weeks of radiation.)   February 7 PCP requested I go the ER. Suspecting an abscess. They did an I&amp;D. Expressed &#34;lots of puss&#34; and left a drain in. To be removed in 5 days. Placed on Bactrim twice a day for 5 days.

A 67-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCIN) lot number: GL9266, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 21Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rheumatic fever (occurred age 7), vulvovaginal dryness and sore joints. The patient was negative on Covid test on an unspecified date. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 28Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and flu shot. Concomitant medications included estradiol (IMVEXXY) taken for vulvovaginal dryness; vitamin C [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D); calcium. On Monday, 22Feb2021, the patient felt draggy, but did not think it was a big deal. She just thought it was from the shot and was feeling tired. The draggy feeling lasted a few days, but she was unable to clarify outcome further. On Tuesday, she started to feel achy and felt like that too was to be expected. The achiness went away on 25Feb2021. On Wednesday, 24Feb2021, she was really busy. She was still achy but was busy. She also did not drink much water for several hours. It dawned on her later when she was not feeling good. Late Wednesday afternoon it was like everything cratered and she felt horrible. She was feeling bad. She was freezing and had chills. It was a horrible feeling. She helps with her grandkids since she is retired. They were home from school and had to sit on the couch. She felt cold, yucky, and achy. It was a yucky feeling. She went home a couple of hours later. She told her husband she had to lie down on the couch because she felt horrible. She could not further describe horrible feeling. Her daughter had called her as well and was unable to describe how she felt to her daughter. She could only say she felt so sick but could not explain further. She felt awful and could not put her finger on it. She was laying down and when she got up, she felt like she would pass out. At that time, she had not eaten dinner yet. She ate dinner, took one bite and the food came back up. For a few moments she felt so faint, she felt shortness of breath, but it was only for a few seconds. After that, her and her and her husband took a drive to go to hospital. However, by the time she got to hospital she was feeling better. She was also talking to a friend at that time who said all of this was probably form the shot as well. Since she was feeling better decided not to go into the hospital and went back home. At the time she was thinking this was all from the shot and no big deal. On Wednesday night, things got crazy and worse. That evening Wednesday she was getting ready for bed and noticed her cheeks were flushed. On Thursday she got up and noticed rash. She was covered all over her body. It did not itchy really, but it was a rash. Not a bumpy rash, it reminds her of Roseola. Her joints and fingers were starting to swell. Her hands were swollen. It started with her knuckles, it went to her fingers, up to her hands, wrist. Her wrist was sore. Her joint swelling was worse. On Friday, she tried to see her doctor, but could not be seen by the doctor. However, she got in with the PA. When she saw the doctor, it could be seen her hands were swollen. However, the main reason she went to the doctor was due to the rash. However, her joints were sore and swollen. Treatment for rash included Hydroxyzine, for joints and fingers swollen/ wrist was soreincluded prednisone 10mg one tablet every day for five days. The patient recovered from the event felt like would pass out/felt so faint and shortness of breath on 24Feb2021. The outcome of the events joints and fingers swelling/hands were swollen, wrist was sore and cheeks flushed was not recovered.

                                                About 9 1/2 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to experience flu-like symptoms : Full body aches, chills and a headache.  Also my armpits felt swollen and hurt a great deal. The symptoms lasted about 30 hours. By 7 am on the second day after the shot I felt fine however, both of my armpits are still hurting. I am assuming it is from swollen lymph nodes.   (After the first shot I went for my annual mammogram and one lymph node in my left arm was still swollen.)

A 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 03Mar2021 14:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6203),at the age of 67-years at vaccination, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received first dose on vaccine on 10Feb2021, LOT:EL9266 to Upper Left Arm. On 03Mar2021 at 2:15PM; patient received the second dose of  the Pfizer covid vaccine, in her  left arm; her adverse reaction turned out to be cellulitis, Patient states, it could have been happening two days or a day before she actually noticed it when she took off the Band-Aid, she had chills and didn&#39;t feel well on day 3 of the vaccine she still didn&#39;t feel well it was still hurting, she looked at the arm, it was swollen looked like Popeyes arm, blotches, warm to touch, she didn&#39;t have a temperature but she  knew something was wrong.  She got an antibiotic started from a doctor, and Famciclovir , that she took one day. She thought all of this stressed her out and she would end up with shingles. the medications are  Doxycylcine, Hyclate, and Famciclovir,  A doctor over the phone said that she had cellulitis, and told me to go into the ER, so early in the afternoon, she went to urgent care and they said she had cellulitis, and that&#39;s when she got the prescriptions. They wanted to see her on 07Mar2021 to check, and it is doing better. The patient was also asking, should she be somebody to get an antibody test, to see if it did it&#39;s job. Does she need to re-do the vaccine?  The patient asked, was the bacteria in the vaccine or in the needle? She feel like there was something in the vaccine, maybe the bacteria was in the vaccine.  LOT EN6203 - She has a Band-Aid from the site kept in a freezer at home. The vaccination Center. She stated she feel really fortunate, she was just scared to death of getting covid. For some reason,  she got a bacterial infection that day, she have no way of knowing if it was the health care worker and bad technique, or bad vaccine.  Psychologically, there&#39;s something about not knowing if the vaccine is protecting me because she took these medications, she was not sure I have the protection, and it creates a level of anxiety. Patient states that she believes she had an adverse reaction from her second dose on 03MAR2021. She states that three days later after the shot, she had already had chills and a feeling of being unwell. The arm she got the vaccine in, left arm, really hurt and she looked in the mirror and could see red blotches from her shoulder to the elbow and it was swollen and warm to touch. Patient states that she called around Saturday morning asking if this was typical or to be expected. She states at one point she called an ER and the doctor there said right away cellulitis and said that someone needed to see her. Patient states that she has no transportation so she had to wait until the afternoon and her son took her to Urgent care to be seen and she was diagnosed with cellulitis from the injection. The patient states she noticed when her arm felt unusual, thinks 6MAR2021. Treatment: Patient states that she was given an antibiotic, Doxycycline HYCLATE, 100mg twice a day for 7 days. She started taking it on Saturday 06Mar2021. Patient states the doctor asked her to come back the following day and looked at it again and thought it was improving and sent her home. Patient states that she also took a one day dose Samciclovir Sunday 07MAR2021. Patient clarifies that she had shingles in past and feels stress is going to cause this to occur again for her. She did take one day dose. She states that she does not have a shingles breakout nor did she have one. States that it prevents shingles breakouts and she took it as a preventative dose. Patient states the actual injection site is still warm and painful. Patient states, because she is on the antibiotic and also took the samsivocloir, a total of 2000mg, she is wondering does that make the vaccination ineffective, would she have to redo it? The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on lot/batch is requested

This continued on for every 5 to 10 minute until 2am. My urine was tinged pink and then continued to get worse. By 2am, it was the color of tomato juice with several clots. I went the the emergency room and was given 1 liter of IV solution and an IV antibiotic. I was released around 4am and returned home. I was prescribed a 7 day regimen of oral antibiotics. I did not feel any pain, only the discomfort from the urge to urinate which lasted about 18 hours. By 9am, my urine was clear and in normal amounts. I have never had a UTI in my life which is why I am reporting this.

                                                Started with loss of taste on Tuesday p.m.. Just after 4am, I awoke my husband because I was about to vomit. From there I was going in and out of consciousness. My husband took my temp and it was just over 104 degrees. He wanted to call an ambulance to take me to the ER, but I refused not realizing how bad off I was. This went on for about 4 hours. My husband applied ice cold wash cloths to my forehead and back of my neck for hours. He finally was able to bring my temp down some. I used the cold cloths for just over two days. I was so fatigued I was unable to walk without help. Had a bad headache too. My husband gave me Tylenol off and on for days. My fever finally broke on the 5th day. I am still left with bad fatigue and some headache.  Have also had diarrhea. My husband kept fluids in me which also included Ensure. I had terrible fever blisters on my lower lip and the inside of my mouth was sore. I am due to have my 2nd shot in about a week, but because I still have some lingering symptoms, was advised to not have 2nd shot.

Adds that she is not saying that is what caused all of this, but that it is just a coincidence that it was exactly 2 weeks after the vaccine, exactly 2 weeks out when this happened. She states that she has been thinking if she should be wasting Pfizers time reporting this but it could be a coincidence or maybe a reaction.

The one in the groin was there for about two weeks. On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 1.5 and was not something that people need to take an Advil or something for.

Clarifies it was right hand thumb. Treatment: took antibiotics, which she states they kept her on in the hospital in IV form. She started the antibiotics on Friday 26Feb2021. Took it Friday afternoon, Friday night, and Saturday and Sunday. She thought it was doing better Sunday night before she passed out. Clarifies Cephalexin, 500 mg daily (Keppra) three times a day and by mouth.  Adds that she keeps this medication on her because she travels the world and it is good to have on hand since it is broad-spectrum. Passing out: 28Feb2021 Sunday night noticed the volume on television was driving her crazy and it was irritating. Around a quarter to 9 she got up to brush her teeth and go to the bathroom. She went pee and then fell off toilet. She got really really dizzy, and her husband was standing over her yelling asking what happened.  She saw the wall and she did not know what happened. States she was out cold and he was calling her name but she did not hear him. She heard him asking what happened but it was in the distance. He got her to bed and about 20 minutes later (husband reports 30 minutes later) she was so dizzy and passed out again.

On 03Apr2021, the patient stated that her muscles and nerves seemed to be locking up like almost paralyzed. The patient described the events she experienced slight dizziness and didn&#39;t worry because it wasn&#39;t major and caller was driving herself and with in an hour the dizziness got worse. Caller had severe headache and had to drive home a significant distance and the time the caller got home, she reports being shaky, dizzy, had headache, nausea, was weak and tired and must have been feverish.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP7534),dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 67years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Beta thalassemias. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient stated she has never had a problem with vaccinations, and she gets the flu vaccine every year. The patient reported that after the first injection coincidentally she did develop a blood clot in her lower leg. She thinks that it was due to a plane ride, but she has never had a blood clot before the injection. She added that she had the first dose on 16Mar2021 and developed a clot in a week. She further clarified that she got her first injection on 16Mar2021 and realized when she went on a flight, which is not that far she developed that clot and was having problems shortly after flight home on 24Mar2021 where her leg swelled up and she is on blood thinners since she went to the emergency room. She added that she developed the clot sometime between that flight and 02Apr2021. She had a doppler study on an unspecified date and it showed a blood clot.  She stated that the outcome was she does not have the blood clot (as reported) but she will be on blood thinners and she needs to follow up on her scan to see if the clot issue is resolved but she will not have a doppler scan for another month or two and the blood thinner she is taking is Xarelto. She also stated that her right leg swelled up and it felt like a log. She reported it felt achy and swollen quite a bit from knee down and her leg was achy. It started between 24Mar2021 and by time she went to the emergency room she was not getting better. She had her symptoms for a week and toward the end of the week she thought she had a blood clot since it was not getting better it just got worse. She added that right now it is not swollen but she has been supine, and she does believe that it is better. The outcome of events was recovering. (As reported &#34;outcome is unknown but pretty sure it has improved because of the blood thinners&#34;./She stated she does not think it has resolved because it takes time for clots to resolve./She added that right now it is not swollen but she has been supine, and she does believe that it is better.)  The reporter stated for the seriousness criteria for event blood clot: she believes as a nurse that any blood clot is extremely dangerous, and she was not hospitalized but obviously a blood clot is serious, and she could have ended up with pulmonary embolism. The seriousness for events right leg swelled and achy was reported as medically disabling.  Causality assessment: Patient stated for the blood clot she has doubts if it was related to the vaccine but is it something that should be known about; for the leg swelling and achy she has doubts but it could have been the plane ride.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the reported events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is unlikely related to the suspected drug. The plane ride may provide an explanation for the events.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A 67 years old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199) on 10Mar2021 17:30 at age of 67 years old at single dose in right upper arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included: last year February, she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, she has had acid reflux in the past. digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable). There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No adverse events (AE) following prior vaccinations. Patient had first Pfizer covid vaccine on 10MAR2021, approximately 10 days to 14 days after the vaccine her face swelled up, numbness and red on left side, went to see my  doctor, he treated her with steroid and antibiotic for sinus infection, at the same time she had some shortness of breath and pounding in my chest, and had and still have ringing in ears since then, it kind of flared up some digestive issues she had last year. If she back up to last year February, she had a bad sinus infection, went to see allergist, family doctor and ENT, all treated her for sinus&#39; before covid testing was even a thing, they didn&#39;t think of covid testing at the time. It ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity.  In March2020 her husband came home with covid, after that, talking to his doctor, she brought him meals outside of the door, it occurred to her that queried if this could have been covid. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable), they were still not sure if it could have been covid. She was supposed to get the second vaccine, she postponed it, the numbness and swelling of face is gone, next shot was tomorrow. Since this was a delayed reaction, typically one to three days would be a reaction to the vaccine. she didn&#39;t associate it with the vaccine, asked if it could have been from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure that she was safe to get the second one. Response: Spoke from EUA factsheet for Recipients and Caregivers: LAB-1451-4.0 Revised: 06 April 2021: Sections: who should not get the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and what the risks of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE were. Spoke from attached VR Consumer- Pfizer cannot assess causality (i.e., cannot assess if what you described/are experiencing is associated with the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine). Your doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise you as your doctor/healthcare provider is most familiar with your medical condition, clinical history, how your treatment has been conducted and any relevant information to your specific case. Patient calling about the COVID vaccine. She states that she had the first vaccine 10MAR2021, and 10 days afterwards her face swelled up. She had numbness in it and redness. She went to the doctor and the doctor thought that maybe it was a sinus infection. So she was treated for that. She states that she did have a few other symptoms. To make a long story short, she was suppose to have the last vaccine last Friday. She postponed it for a week (postponed getting the second shot for a week). She wants to know what Pfizer thinks about her getting her second vaccine and her side effects. She says that somewhere between the 10th and 14th day, after receiving the vaccine the symptoms started and that was why she did not think she had a reaction to the vaccine. She has not had anything like that before, it was sort of a delayed reaction. She states she is better now. She had a few symptoms after the face things started and the only thing that she still has now is ringing in her ears. She states it all started around the same time as her face issues, or might have started a little after that. She confirms everything but ringing in her ears have completely resolved. She states that she did have some digestive disturbances, shortness of breath, and throbbing in her chest after receiving the vaccine. She asks if she can go back a little bit to explain. She states that last FEB2020 she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. She went to her allergist, then her family doctor, and then an ENT. She states that it was nothing like she has ever had, it was really bad. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, she has had acid reflux in the past but it was nothing like this. In March her husband had COVID and tested positive for COVID. She decided to get tested and she tested negative. She wonders if she had COVID earlier but at that time they were not testing for COVID. Her digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, and she was still on the medications her gastrointestinal doctor put her on. They are hypersensitive esophageal medication. She states that she has been exhausted all the time. The rest of the story she has told already. She states that after the face thing happened she started getting those digestive issues again. Her friend suggested that she call Pfizer, so she is doing that. She confirms that the vaccine card does not have an expiration date, NDC, or dosing information. She states it says 0.3 ml, but she cant see a point, so she doesn&#39;t know if its just 03. She states she got the vaccine to lessen her chances of getting a severe disease, in case she ends up in the hospital. Also, to keep herself safe from other people. She states she wants the second one because husbands works with the public and she wants to be protected when he comes home. She states that she has those gastrointestinal disturbances and is on amitriptyline 10 mgs for that. She states she also takes something for her thyroid but she has no major health issues. She states that she had a endoscopy and a colonoscopy as well as blood work done but she doesn&#39;t have any of the results because they are in her Beaumont chart where she actually got the vaccine. All of this was pre-vaccine so she doesn&#39;t know how relevant it is. The patient did not require a visit to Emergency Room, but visit to Physician Office. The only thing similar had a sister who reacted to a shingles vaccine, She has no information about her sisters reaction to the vaccine. Outcome of event ringing in ears was not recovered, for others was recovered.      No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                skin reaction; skin reaction red rash under both armpits; soreness in arm; ears would get warm feeling very hot; swelling in arm; ears would get warm feeling very hot; skin is dry from being inflamed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6203, expiration date not reported), on towards side of muscle in right arm via intramuscular on 02Mar2021 14:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included female surgery (caller stated she takes Miralax regularly every other day for the last 5 years for a female surgery and her female surgeon says she needs it to stay out but the ingredient is also in Miralax. Caller then stated she knew it was not that ingredient causing the reaction), pneumonia (Caller stated she had the Pneumonia shot). Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (D3) at units everyday from an unspecified date and macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) taken for female surgery. The patient previously took zyrtec [cetirizine hydrochloride] for seasonal allergies like dust (Caller stated she usually takes Zyrtec for seasonal allergies like dust. Caller stated she took no Zyrtec at all for either shots) and received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EM9809), at the age of 67-years on bicep left arm upper muscle on 09Feb2021 14:00 for Covid-19 immunisation. On an unknown date the patient experienced skin reaction red rash under both armpits, soreness in arm, ears would get warm feeling very hot, swelling in arm, skin is dry from being inflamed. The report received as, Caller received the COVID vaccine and stated she had rosy red, inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly her bilateral armpits and then sometimes ears would get hot. She had second COVID 19 vaccine and also had first one. The first dose was on 09Feb2021 and she had swelling in arm after shot and has been using a cool cloth on it and was better by the next day. Caller then states she still feels it though and it has been five weeks. Caller states she tries to turn arm and can still feel it but it is not bad. Caller states a day later she had her first skin reaction which was a red rash under both armpits. She called primary care doctor and talked to nurse to see if she should try some other medication before second shot and the nurse recommended she should not get second shot that she should see an allergist. She got to building for second shot and talked to nurse there. She asked the nurse about the quality of first and second shot working together if she had waited and not got second shot. the nurse told her she would have to come back at least four days after the second shot was due or it would not work together. She went ahead and got the vaccine and it has not been life threatening as of now. She saw an allergist three days after second shot. She had rosy red inflamed armpits and when it would flare up her ears would get warm feeling, very hot, but not anywhere else and it was just mainly bilateral armpit and then sometimes ears would get hot. She would take Benadryl and her primary care physician told her to try to take Allegra 24 hours but caller stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours. She took the Allegra medication on Sunday morning and that it worked for her for about 12 hours and she knew she could not take any more Allegra but the Benadryl seemed to help and her Allergist felt she made the right decision since her events are not life-threatening since it is not respiratory. The Allergist saw her armpits agreed the children Benadryl was working and that she should stick with that, but it is not going away been like this the whole time since 02Mar2021 and still having a reaction in her armpits, after the second shot the flare up was quicker because first shot was already in system still, it is not a flare up like when someone can not eat seafood and stuff like that. She still has a rosy armpit and probably will not see her HCP unless she gets bad but she will go to Allergist. She wanted to wait for second dose before contacting Pfizer to see what would happen. She is really blossoming under the armpits and they are rosy red but no blisters and her skin is dry from being inflamed all this time. She squeezes a rag under her armpits and that it is better during the day than at night, it is worse at night. She is only taking 20 mL of Benadryl in the morning and then evening before bed. The first shot right at the beginning she had to take Benadryl in the middle of the night as well but got to where she was taking it 12 hours apart before second dose. She hopes she is not having to walk around with compresses in the summer as it is easier when it is cold and that she hopes this fazes. Since she had not taken a shower or hot bath this morning that she had rosy red cheeks like a rosy red U on her face. Caller states her sister asked what did she did and she said nothing. Swelling in arm was from the first shot it was really hot like a boil but it was not red it just felt hot, she used a cold compress during the night like a washrag and by the next day it was fine. She got the shot on the left arm on purpose because she was left handed and could move it more but noticed the swelling stayed a while. When she got the second shot she asked the nurse to give in her back upper part of bicep in arm muscle since it was a better location and it did not swell up and it did not hurt. She can still feel exactly where she got the first shot. Swelling in arm was not terrible. her allergist felt she made the right decision since it is not life threating like respiratory related or closing of throat like food allergies just uncomfortable and annoying. Skin reaction red rash under both armpits was the event started the first day after the first shot then still having reaction from the second shot. She had the reaction a couple hours later and did wait half hour before leaving after getting the shot with the second shot she did not experience any swelling or soreness. The reason she went ahead and got the second shot at the medical building was she asked the nurse how many people had skin reaction before second shot. Ears would get warm feeling very hot, she only experienced it six times and it was usually at night or in the morning from the second shot. Every once in a it while flare up from the first. The hurt was always in the center of armpit not in the armpit. Skin was dry from being inflamed from past couple of days her skin has been dry. She has used hand cream but is afraid to put anything else on it because of reaction. The serious criteria is just annoying. She will probably put cream on it so it does not crack, it is very dry and it has not been dry like this. she has been putting water on at night which could have dried it out. Some days is worse than others more red and this was persisting. The second shot is much better and that she does not feel it at all. She can still feel where the vaccine went in left arm. It is annoying but it does not keep her from moving her arm and it has been five weeks. Since it is not going away it is serious. The soreness had not gone away before she got the second shot so double whammy. She guesses right now it is uncomfortable and that she has had better days. She is not taking Benadryl in middle of day like before but it is itchy so she is going to go out in the cold and work in yard, before first week or two she would use cool compresses all day and take Benadryl during day and then at night it petered out. She is hoping it will fade out eventually. Caller stated that the seriousness criteria is medically significant. She is taking Children Benadryl 20mL and would take at least every 6 six hours and was trying to hold off to now taking it 12 hours and will use cold compress if she has to. her primary care physician told her to try to take Allegra 24 hours but caller stated it did not work that it only worked for 12 hours and not the full 24 hours. She took the Allegra medication on Sunday morning and that it worked for about 12 hours and she knew she could not take any more Allegra. The medical ingredient was Fexofenadine HCL 180mg antihistamine. She only took one pill as it did not work. she had not had an an anaphylactic reaction yet. She is taking Children Benadryl 20mL and would take at least every 6 six hours and was trying to hold off to now taking it 12 hours and will use cold compress if she has to. Outcome of the events skin reaction red rash under both armpits, soreness in arm and skin is dry from being inflamed were not recovered and remaining events were unknown.

                                                I immediately sat down for 1 hour, felt I had something , like i felt possible slight chest tightness. I say I was fine until 3-4 hours later, I had extreme headaches. At 430pm, I still had the headaches and I took Tylenol 500mg. At night my headache got worse and it felt like I had the flu. I then went to bed and when I woke up my left arm felt intense like hornets and it was swollen. I then took another Tylenol and Ibuprofen 600mg. At 4am, I felt awful and horrible. I had joint pain with aches, felt nauseated. I called my PCP and he told me to take Prednisone 10mg. My fever was 101.4F. By the night my fever was gradually coming down and it was 102F. By the next day I felt much better.  I also had Covid-19 on March 2020 and also got tested for antibody test in July 2020.  I spoke with my PCP and he is recommending I do not take the 2nd dose injection.

Vital signs were taken.  Blood pressure up slightly, heart rate slightly elevated Sent home without treatment but recommended I should take antihistamine at home. I took a 12-hour allegra about 12pm and a single 25 mg benadryl tablet at bedtime. The symptoms lasted about 3-4 hours before resolving.  They did not get worse from the immediate reaction. Recommended contacting my family physician for advice of what to do before 2nd shot which is scheduled for Feb. 15, 2021

I was cranky, not myself, going to bed, I woke several times as I rolled over onto my right arm.  When I awoke early, I was swollen from Head to Toes, my eyes were slits, my bracelets and rings were swollen into my skin, and my toes and ankles were large. AND I was grouchy about everything.  As the day went on I was just mad about everything,  I began to drink lots of water and tried to exercise to get the swelling down.   About noon, my eyes and face began to ease, but my body didn&#39;t ease till about 2pm, as my rings and bracelets were movable  then. I am still swollen and still angry and it is Friday.

A 68-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EJ1685, via an unspecified route of administration on 22Dec2020 at 11:30, at 68 years of age, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed 3 years before this report, coronary artery disease she has had for about 10 years and takes losartan for it, COVID-19 infection from Mar2020 to an unknown date; her family history is relevant for diabetes mellitus. In 2019 the patient got 2 flu vaccines at the same time, the regular flu and the one for seniors, and also the pneumonia shot. So she got 3 vaccines at once. Afterward she got sick and was in bed with chills and everything, she couldn&#39;t eat and was sick for the day. It was explained that she was at work but left for the day. This only lasted for the one day and she was fine and back to work the next day. There were no concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020 the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes on her left side; she got the shot on that side due to bad arthritis on the right side. It wasn&#39;t that bad and disappeared after 2 days. She did tell the doctor and was told by the doctor it was thought to just be inflammation from the shot. The patient recovered from the reported event on an 25Dec2020.

                                                68-year-old female evaluated for painful movement of her extremities. Patient reports that her symptoms started the day after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at pharmacy. Patient was admitted. Patient has been evaluated by Neurology, Rheumatology and the Ortho-Spine Service. Symptoms improved with prednisone. Although unclear, a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica was being considered due to elevated CRP (inflammatory marker). Relationship to vaccine administration is also unclear. Pt with Hx of arthritis, COPD, CAD, CHF, and HTN received first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Within 24 hours of vaccine administration, pt went to hospital c/o of painful movement of extremities. Pt was treated with prednisone and symptoms improved. She was evaluated by multiple specialties including neurology, rheumatology and orthopedics without a clear diagnosis. Her CRP was elevated to 17.2 mg/dL and Sed Rate to greater than 130 mm/hr and reactive ANA titer. Total CK was normal at 23 IU/L. Rheumatology wrote this is highly suggestive of COVID-19 vaccine induced polymyalgia rheumatica which has been reported with other vaccines but not with COVID-19 vaccines.

A 68-year-old female patient received first single dose BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 29Jan2021 15:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insomnia and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated, &#34;I got the vaccine yesterday about 3 pm and I came home and I had dinner and sat down to watch TV at 9 O&#39; clock, I turn the program on and I was out like a &#39;light&#39; and this stuff knock me out (onset date: 29Jan2021). My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Starting the first  day I had muscle aches, swollen glands, headache, tiredness  and chills, this lasted for three days.  Then I did feel better for a few days but had some tiredness.   Then Sunday the 28th my body seemed over whelmed with sweats and chills, I developed a rash in my groin area and realized that I had a yeast infection that was affecting my vaginal area, groin, and mouth.  I have been treating this with a natural yeast complex and Monistat.   I am starting to do better today but felt that I needed to report it to see if others were having the same problem.  I feel that the injection adversely affected my body&#39;s normal  hemostasis and the yeast was the results.  I am not looking forward to getting the next shot.  I think I did have Covid 19 in late January or early February before it  was widely known  and there were no tests.   I will keep treating myself with natural remedies as chemicals will just inflame the yeast at this time.  This is not life threatening but wanted to report the abnormal reaction I have experienced.

I iced it, took Tylenol and Benadryl at bedtime. Today it is less painful, but larger, redder and with itching. It is raised and looks like a small pancake on my arm. I did not have this reaction with my first dose.

                                                I received the vaccine at 9AM on March 1st in my right arm.  Everything was fine until 3 PM when my right arm started swelling.  I ran a temperature of 100.1, had fatigue and a headache, in addition to aches and pains.  By Tuesday morning my right arm from the injection site to the elbow was twice it&#39;s normal size.  My chest and underarm area were both significantly swollen. I had an 8:30 AM appointment on Tuesday with an allergist who advised me to take Benadryl, which I did. By Wednesday, my chest and abdominal area were both swollen.  I had a lymphedema therapy appointment because I have lymphedema on my left side due to node removal. The therapist measured both arms and they were both swollen, including my chest and abdomen.  The therapist advised me to see my oncologist as swelling in the Right Arm, (where i received the shot) was normal for COVID shots, but she could not explain the swelling in the chest or abdomen.  Other than that my lymphatic system was working overtime. I called my oncologist on Thursday March 4, and they fit me in.  Doctor examined me and he couldn&#39;t explain to me why I was swelling up the way I was.  He has only seen arm swelling in his breast cancer patients. He is referring me to get a PET scan and advised me to see a breast surgeon as maybe the surgeon would know more about the lymph nodes.

A 68-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 10Feb2021 10:30 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety. It was reported that the patient was &#34;physically fit. She was thin and was about 5 feet.&#34; Ongoing concomitant medications included escitalopram (reported as &#34;generic Lexapro&#34;) for anxiety, calcium, and multivitamins. The patient previously received flu vaccine in Oct2020. She also had her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9262) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 20Jan2021 10:30 AM for COVID-19 immunization and felt a little soreness in arm and light headache the same day. Two nights later, her scalp felt on fire and had tingling sensation in her face for three weeks. A week after the first dose, her blood pressure went up to 210/101. She went to the hospital, they controlled her pressure and put her on a pressure pill 1 a day (amlodipine). She mentioned she had felt a weird sensation and noticed some spikes in her blood pressure. Her physician told her to take another 2.5 mg amlodipine if needed. After her second dose, she went to sleep with achy arm. she woke up that night with a tingling sensation from head to toe. Her whole body was tingling. It was a weird and scary on and off sensation. She stated it had improved during the past two days. The patient confirmed that she had no heart rate problems. She actually experienced high blood pressure instead. She never had numbness, instead she had a tingling sensation still present. She mentioned her 97-year-old mother and husband both got the two doses with no complication or reactions. The patient&#39;s cousin was &#34;pretty sure that it&#39;s Guillain-Barre.&#34; The patient stated the Guillain-Barre syndrome has not yet been confirmed. She had an appointment with a neurologist. The outcome of &#39;tingling sensation from head to toe/whole body was tingling/weird and scary on and off sensation&#39; was recovering, of remaining events was unknown.

The patient reported having a hot face and neck was flushed, after the vaccine, she stated she had tingling in her tongue, lips, and face. And she stated her throat felt tight also, her lips were puffy, and a lot of heat of neck and face, thought she was starting to shake. The patient reported the pharmacist gave EpiPen in thigh and 20 mg tablet of Benadryl and called 911, and took her to the local hospital. Patient also reported that she has not seen this doctor yet she asked to see her and has an appointment with her. The patient also stated that her new PCP was not aware of the reaction to the vaccine at this time. The patient further mentioned that she was still having a rash that broke out. She reported that her tongue was tingling and she still has some swelling in her lips. Patient continues to clarify she still has swelling and some tingling on the tip of tongue and half back on her tongue. She stated that the swelling was persisting and that Benadryl or Prednisone does give some relief but it comes back. Patient mentioned being on a 4 day cycle of Prednisone, takes two in the morning with food. The patient clarified the location of the rash as a rash on both arms that was inside of both of the arms, like a pink rash, she states it was on face and on knees around the front and back of her knees like a red rash. She continues it was on the neck down to the collar bone around the back of her neck, like if she was a bust statue it would be all in that area from the collar bones at that point up and around the back of the shoulder blades. It goes all the way around face and neck. Patient also further reported that she had a scary reaction last night (07Mar2021), she said she had blood in her stool, leaking blood around rectum and it had like a burning itch, when she wiped it was blood, she continued to say when she wiped it was like &#39;giblets.&#39; She stated was stool, blood, and giblets.

She has two Epi Pens from the drug store that was prescribed but she was afraid to use it, and she thought to see what happens if she uses the Benadryl. She received the Epi shot at the drug store, at (pharmacy), when her reaction broke out, on 06Mar2021, in her thigh, for the allergic reaction. This was her first time ever receiving EpiPen (Lot 029F20AA, expiration Mar2022, and NDC is 0093-5986-27). The ER doctor prescribed her 0.3 mg every 5-15 minutes as needed for anaphylaxis, and not to exceed 3 doses. She received the Benadryl at the drug store, 120mg tablet, first dose was given at drug store. Patient reported she was given prednisone IV in hand through IV at ER, she doesn&#39;t know how much that was, then was given Prednisone to go home with- 20mg tablets take 2 a day for 4 days, which she started Sunday morning, 07Mar2021. She was told she experienced a life threatening allergic reaction. Patient was taken to the ER in the ambulance, the paramedic who was with her said she was his first COVID reaction patient. ER doctor told her not to take the second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and to be cautious if taking the EpiPen, she states her heart was racing because of the EpiPen and was told it was because she was not younger that her body did not handle the Epi like younger people do and was told she could have a heart attack from the EpiPen. She was scared because she was not covered fully, since she can&#39;t get the second shot of Pfizer, and she was afraid of the Epi Pen, so she was really in a tough spot. ER doctor stated she may be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, as the second, but she needs to talk to her Primary care about that. The ER doctor continued to tell her it would have to be a special case where she was in a hospital setting in case she has another serious reaction, she was concerned for not receiving the second dose because that means she was not completely covered with one vaccine. She was afraid of the Epi-Pen since she can get a heart attack from it because of her age. The patient mentioned she was tested in Oct (clarified as 14Oct2020) for Covid due to having a viral infection at that time but was negative. Added the ER paper work says ED anaphylaxis. The patient wanted to ask about finding out the ingredients in Pfizer vaccine and the ingredients in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. She saw the list on the fact sheet of Pfizer&#39;s ingredients and in a few places it says Potassium, 3 different ingredients, and several months ago, she quit eating bananas, bananas have potassium, and they were giving her stomach upset, diarrhea, she used to eat them all her life, she noticed that there was a lot of potassium in the medicine. Doctor wanted to know if she would be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. He said if she got the second shot, of the Johnson and Johnson, that it would have to be a special case, like in a hospital setting, and there would have to be medical people in a medical center, to take care of her was she has a reaction to it as well. He advised that she take the Johnson and Johnson than not taking it, because by not taking it, she was very vulnerable to catching COVID 19. And patient wanted to know was it a preservative that was causing the reaction. It was reported that rash began around 10PM, bloody stool began between 11 PM and 12:30 AM, all other symptoms within 15-20 minutes, it began around 6PM, maybe sooner 5:55 PM, she was in denial, it felt like tongue and lips tingling, she did have a reaction before to a different shot. The anaphylactic reaction required emergency room visit. Patient was not hospitalized and was in observation in ER.

A 68-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6205, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in her right arm on 05Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included allergy and had prosthetic left knee. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took tobramycin (NEBRACIN) for unspecified indication and experienced sensitivity. On an unspecified date, the patient reported that when she took the inoculation at that moment she developed a form of a response or reaction rather and they had to put her into the medical cubicle for observation and to treat her at that moment. Her arm had gotten very swollen. It became very hot and it became black and blue, it bleed and went black and blue and she was sitting in the medical cubicle for approximately an hour and a half until the medical staff said that she was really not to be and when she did leave she wasn&#39;t feeling well and she was light headed, her breathing was not anyway affected but she felt very fatigue. That itself now was not an issue. They started giving her ice on that particular area where the inoculation took place and she consistently for that an hour and a half used the ice on her right arm until she finally left an hour and a half later. As the weekend preceded, the patient began to feel that her throat bothering her as of today and her throat felt raspy. It was reported that she might and she was not sure because she has not gone to the doctor yet that she might have a Strep throat when she has an allergic reaction to something that her body does not accept very well. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 68-year-old female contactable consumer reporting for herself received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6200, expiry date Jun2021) on 16Feb2021 at 14:45, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine for age and several comorbidities. No other vaccines were administered within 4 weeks. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed 25 years ago, ongoing hypothyroidism diagnosed 25 years ago, liver resection in 2007 for a benign tumor (she had not been sick and it was found accidentally), liver bile duct stopped up from 2017 and ongoing (due to scar tissue from the liver resection surgery; she had an emergency stent placed in her bile duct), chronic Crohn&#39;s disease, ongoing thyroid disorder. The patient previously received flu vaccines on unspecified dates for immunization experiencing unspecified side effects some years ago, but this past year she didn&#39;t have a reaction. The patient previously received pneumonia shots on unspecified dates since few years. Family history included gallbladder problems in her sisters and mother. Concomitant medications included oral amlodipine (manufacturer: Lupin, expiry date: 23Feb2022) from an unspecified date (a few years ago) and ongoing, 5 mg at night, for blood pressure, oral telmisartan (MICARDIS; manufacturer: Alembic, expiry date: 02Mar2022) from an unspecified date (few years ago) and ongoing, 80 mg at night, for blood pressure, oral metoprolol (manufacturer: Mylan, expiry date: 09Feb2022), from an unspecified date (few years ago) and ongoing, 25 mg twice daily, morning and night, for blood pressure, oral levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date (20 years ago or more), 75 ug daily in morning, with water, hour before any eating or other medications, for thyroid disorder. The patient experienced sepsis on 25Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 03Mar2021, gallbladder attack on 24Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, passed out from the gallbladder attack on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of unknown, got dizzy on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, weakness from being hospitalized on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, she was trying to gain her strength from being sick on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of unknown, her head hurt from the fall on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. The patient was hospitalized for sepsis due to a gallbladder attack from 25Feb2021 to 03Mar2021. The events gallbladder attack and sepsis required also an ER visit. They did not require a physician office visit. Additional clinical course of the events included the following details. Gallbladder attack turned into infection/sepsis quickly. She previously had an emergency stent placed in her bile duct and now there was a stone in the bile duct and she was unsure if it was related; they will either remove her gallbladder or place a permanent stent. They removed stones and &#34;goop&#34; and placed a stent. Her gallbladder still needed to be operated on, but she was not sick with sepsis anymore. Regarding gallbladder attack the patient reported that it was controlled until further tests and surgery were performed. They couldn&#39;t do the surgery due to the infection which had cleared up but she did not want the surgery right now. A stent was placed in the duct until something was done and the stone will be crushed eventually. The patient passed out from the gallbladder attack. She never passed out, she had only ever passed out one other time in her 20&#39;s where she stood up too fast. The patient reported that she had to walk slower because she got dizzy and she was trying to adjust to getting home. She walked to the bathroom, used it, and her husband heard a thump while he was using the other bathroom. She was looking at the thermostat and fell in the den and she was surprised she didn&#39;t hit anything. Her head hurt from the fall. Sepsis: caller reported that as soon as she went to the ER, she was diagnosed with sepsis. Sepsis resolved the day she was discharged from hospital and when she was dismissed all tests were negative for sepsis. She went home on antibiotics for security for another week after discharge from hospital. Dizzy: it was just trying to get her strength up. She&#39;ll just be doing nothing and getting up too fast, it happened to any old person with blood pressure medicines. Dizziness began before she went into the hospital. She was experiencing weakness from being hospitalized and she was trying to gain her strength from being sick. Weakness began during her hospital admission and it was ongoing. On 03Mar2021 the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included haematocrit: 30.4 %, haemoglobin: 10.4 g/dl (not in normal range yet), CMP: within normal limits (all results were within normal limits, including sodium and potassium), platelet count: 159, RBC count: 3.33 (supposed to be 3.9 or more but could have gotten better by now), WBC: 6.1 x10?/L, blood cultures: the results were not yet listed but sepsis was gone according to discharge blood work. She went to the doctor regularly. Her doctor knew how sensitive that was with her, but that her side effects were probably no more than anyone that experienced that. In some years she did not experience adverse events, specifically she did not with her flu vaccine in 2020. She has had side effects that had made her feel ill for 2-3 days and her niece was a nurse and thought she was making it up. The patient was advised to wait for the 2nd dose, she was unable to get it as scheduled on 08Mar2021. In meantime between receiving her first dose and her appointment for her second dose on 08Mar2021, she was hospitalized. The patient was just coming out of the hospital before 08Mar2021 and she still did not feel well so she cancelled the appointment. The hospital doctors, as well as the doctors approaching more tests with her gallbladder, recommended to not get the second dose as scheduled on 08Mar2021, but they could not recommend how or when to get it.

                                                A few days after my shot I started feeling very tired and groggy.  My head was dizzy most of the day.  Five days after the vaccination I started to go into a sweat if I exerted myself too much.  I continued to have a dizzy head and my stamina was greatly reduced.  I used to ride my exercise bike for 90 -150 minutes a day but  after the vaccine I could only go 20 minutes the first week and then I got progressively weaker and more dizzy.  I could barely walk a half block.  I also experienced some shortness of breath and a racing heart at times.  The third week out was the worse.  I could hardly care for myself.  I started to get a lot of pain behind my eyes and other sinus pressure.  Also the lymph gland under my ear was swollen and painful.  I was extremely tired for a couple of days at that point but have found it hard to sleep on most other nights.  I have strange dreams that are almost like an hallucination.  I also have head aches but they seem to have improved as the weeks have gone by, especially since I have been taking Aleve every day.  I am unable to exercise and have very little energy still.  The dizzy head continues to persist even  6 weeks out.  I had this same kind of dizzy head in August when I had Covid but it went away in a week or two.  I get dizzy just reading a book or looking at my piano music also.  Having had Covid twice I am very confident that these symptoms were caused by this vaccination.  It also seemed to make my blood sugar more volatile.  The sad thing is that I was feeling perfectly normal when I went in!  I am devastated by these symptoms and they have completely altered my life.  I am so discouraged that they never go away.  Some days I feel like I am improving and then they pop up again.  I was a very active person and now I can hardly do anything.  I think I got the shot too close to when I had covid and that it has triggered an immune response that is overwhelming my body.  Will it ever get better?  I can&#39;t stand to go on like this!

A 68-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6204) at single dose on 20Mar2021 14:54 injected in left arm in the muscle for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included shortness of breath, hypothyroidism and COVID-19 back in Dec2020. She had some food allergies that were diagnosed prior to getting the vaccine. Patient was tested positive for COVID on 21Dec2020 and negative on 20Jan2021. The symptoms followed for patient was a little coughing and no smell for 3 days and a little shortness of breath.  Family medical history was none. Concomitant drug included levothyroxine 0.75 ug, once daily for hypothyroidism, which was taking for 15 years (as of 19Apr2021). No previous history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.  Patient experienced left arm painful on 20Mar2021 about an hour or two after she got the injection, did not have much energy on 21Mar2021 08:00, foggy and not clear from 21Mar2021 to 22Mar2021 08:00, shortness of breath started 24Mar2021 or 25Mar2021, and hyperventilation on an unknown date in Mar2021 (reported as a week or 9 days after receiving vaccine). The shortness of breath was what she referred to as hyperventilating.  That came a week after the vaccine. The same date they took shot was when the arm pain started and the low energy was the day after. Foggy and not being clear was from 21Mar2021 to 22Mar2021. Shortness of breath started 24Mar2021 or 25Mar2021.  In additional to shortness of breath, she had been hyperventilating.  That began approximately a week or 9 days after receiving vaccine. Left arm was painful and it got swollen a bit and lasted for 48 hours. The husband experienced arm pain and said he almost had a fever and felt fatigued.  The reporter thinks patient (his wife) felt the same.  She had arm pain and not much energy. They came out of that ok.  About a week after the first injection, she just cannot catch her breath.  She started hyperventilating to the point where the husband thought she would expire.  She also experienced being foggy and not clear and having no energy.  First, she went to a Cardiologist and he said there was nothing wrong.   She then saw a lung doctor who send for respiratory chest and did chest CT scans and everything was clear on both test.  He did not prescribe any medications. A week after she saw him, she went to the ER on 31Mar2021for hyperventilation and shortness of breath.  They prescribed Xanax (AER 2021434900).  She said it did not work and they prescribed something else. It was 25 mg twice a day which was in a pharmacy vial.  They then prescribed Lorazepam. She was afraid to take it.  She took one instead of two. The dose was 0.25 mg twice daily.  The ER did CT scan of chest with Contrast.  It was negative for thromboembolism (also reported as CAT scan&#39;s negative for blood clots). She had shortness of breath before the vaccination and it got worse. She was managing it though.  Outcome of left arm painful, foggy and not clear, did not have much energy/having no energy/low energy was resolving. Outcome of shortness of breath and hyperventilation was not resolved. Outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 69-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EH9899 and expiration date Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration first dose on 12Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included Asthma, Allergy, and Penicillin allergy. Concomitant medication included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) for allergy at 180 mg, daily, budesonide (PULMICORT) for Asthma at Pulmicort is a inhaler 180, 2 puffs a day, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) for Asthma at 10 mg.  Historical vaccine includes Tetanus and experienced allergic reaction. Past drug includes Sulphur and experienced allergy. It was reported that the patient had the vaccine on 12Jan2021 and patient was working in long term care &#34;administrator&#34;. The patient did get a reaction and the patient hands swelled up about 20 minutes after the vaccine and her tongue swelled up. The patient did take Benadryl. The patient called her primary care doctor and was told to stay on the Benadryl and the patient was okay. The patient stated that the pharmacist that gave her the vaccine gave the Benadryl right away when the patient started swelling up.  The patient spoke to her allergist and stated that she cannot take the second dose vaccine. So, the patient was concerned about her coverage because she work in a long term case. The doctor would not give me the shingle vaccine (unspecified vaccine) because they were afraid the patient would have a reaction to that.  The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                She got the vaccine which was fine, at the end of the 20 minute waiting period had a spot the size of a dime, really sore and pink.  On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

She said the headache pain was a sharp pain at the bottom of the back of her head and neck. She clarified she had migraines when she was 12 or 13 years old, but the headache pain she had now is nothing like the migraines she had then. She further clarified that her severe headache feels like a knife in the back of her head and neck. She said the pain is more severe on the right side of her head than the left. She said right now she has pressure in the front of her head with a slight headache. She additionally clarified that the swelling in her left eye comes and goes and is persisting. She said her left eye didn&#39;t swell close, but her granddaughter told her it looks like something is wrong with her left eye. She added that she had dizziness this morning when she was going to work. She said she stumbled when she was walking this morning but drove to work anyway. She said when she got to work, she wasn&#39;t feeling well on an unspecified date, so she decided to go back home. She said when she was walking to her car, she stumbled again, and fell against her car. She reported when she first got the COVID-19 Vaccine (19Jan2021), she was driving in a bad way. She said after she got her COVID-19 Vaccine, she picked up an elderly lady she sits with, and the elderly lady told her she wasn&#39;t normal.

She said she has never sweated like that before. She reported her left arm is sore too. She said the left arm pain started immediately after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine (19Jan2021). She said she has swelling too, and has been rubbing her left arm with alcohol, but the left arm soreness is still there. She reported that she tasted the COVID-19 Vaccine shot when it was administered. She has blown off calling her doctor when she first experienced her side effects, but then her headache got worse.

She clarified that the medication was dispensed in a pharmacy was oxycodone, acetaminophen (PERCOCET). She called her doctor when she returned home from work this morning, and her doctor told her to call Pfizer to report her side effects. She reported when she went to work this morning, she got lightheaded. She took Percocet and other medications, but it hasn&#39;t relieved it. She says it&#39;s not a migraine. She recalled experiencing &#34;swelling around her eyes&#34; and &#34;had some swelling&#34; after the first dose of the Pfizer-Biontech COVID19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She reported on 02Feb2021 that she was calling back today to report that her headaches were worse. She said her headaches are not a migraine, but more like a muscle spasm in the right side of her head, above her ear. She said the pain is between her neck and ear on the right side of her head. She said the headache pain feels like it is as big as a golf ball. She said her headache pain is so severe, the headache pain wakes her up in a cry. She said the headache pain lasts 15-20 minutes, and then eases up slightly. She said the headaches have been happening twice at night, and twice during the daytime. She said the headache pain doesn&#39;t last long. She mentioned that she has been doing self-remedies.

                                                One week after Vaccine #1 I began to have swelling &amp; itching of the face-eyes, lips and cheeks, extreme itching of both hands, massive diarrhea and some difficulty swallowing. I took oral benadryl (50 mg) and prednisone (@ 50 mg) and applied cold packs to my face and hands. I also took Allegra 180 mg LA 2x/daily for two weeks after the reaction. Vaccine dose 2 was administered on 2/17/2021 (Pfizer, Lot # EN6201) at Hospital, . One week after that (2/25/2021) I again had facial swelling and itching and massive diarrhea. I took Benadryl 25 mg and Allegra 2x/day and continue to do so.  The facial swelling/itching continued.             In addition I had, since the first vaccine, extreme fatigue, resulting in a decrease in my ability to walk (down from 3 miles to just over 1 mile) and to swim (shortness of breath, reduction in ability to swim laps). I visited my Rheumatologist on 3/2/2021 and he administered an injection of methylprednisolone to try and tamp down the continuing reaction. That seems to have made a difference.

I have had several episodes of that since, and my vision in that eye continues to be somewhat blurred. I have continued to have swollen lymph nodes in many areas of my body as well as pressure in my head.

A 69-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number:  EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, second dose on 17Feb2021 at single dose, for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  There were no concomitant medications. Patient took the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Lot: EL9264) on 27Jan2021 for COVID-19 vaccination. Patient got her second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine 17Feb2021 and experienced side effects such as painful lymph node and breast pain on 18Feb2021. She said that her lymph node in her breast is killing her on the side that she had the vaccine. She clarified that it is very painful and her breast itself is very painful. She said that she did go to the doctor to be sure that is what it was. She further reported that by Thursday night (18Feb2021), it started bothering and her breast started bothering her. She thought she pulled a muscle at first. She said that it has progressed and got worse and that Sunday night she was in agony. She called the doctor Monday for her left breast that hurts.  She said that she is taking ibuprofen (ADVIL, Lot: DJ6716, Expiration: Dec2022), taking 3 of them at a time, but it is not really helping. She had no reaction at the injection site. It is not red and you cannot see anything there. She said that is why she is not even sure. She said that there was no pain at all there. She said that there is nothing wrong with her and she does not feel sick, she just hurts. She said that she was tired because she is not sleeping well due to the pain. Patient wants to know what pain medication she could use that will not counteract the vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 3/8/21 (first dose) in the left arm.  She woke next morning with blisters on the left hand, then developed widespread pruritis that only involved the left side of the body.  Had swelling around left eye.  No frank hives, no SOB or dyspnea.  Treated in ER with oral Benadryl.  Now 1 week later, she still has itching throughout the entire left side, from scalp down to feet. Still taking Benadryl once daily now.  Wondering about whether to get the second vaccine.

Intense pain and swelling of right side of neck for 3 days. Also left wrist unable to use.  Pale, ill.  Vital signs ok.  Then on 3/8, pain switched to left side of neck and upper back. 3/10, right neck again with swollen lymph nodes bilateral.   3/11 back of neck and upper back hurts.  Intense.  Could not sleep. 3/12 pain in upper quads and hips, mid pack.  Feeling freezing cold.  Temp ok.  Called my Dr.  Right side of neck continued to hurts even now (3/28/2021) but at least I can function now.  I no longer feel sick, brain fog, cold.  So greatly improved but not normal.  Reaction has lasted a month.  Vaccine number one resulted in 2 days feeling ill with upper back pain, chills but only a few days.  First night vomited, passed out.  First vaccine reaction was frightening but was short lived.  I am a retired RN.

The patient had no medical history. The patient did not receive concomitant medications. The patient did not underwent any lab investigation. Consumer stated, &#34;I am just reporting that I did had a reaction slight reaction to the Shot, Pfizer Shot that I received two days ago. It came about approximately 8 hours after I had the shot my face started swelling, itching, red, so I took couple Benadryl at night, got up the next morning and it was still really swollen, itchy, red. So, I have been on the Benadryl for the last two days. When I got up this morning it is considerably better but I just wanted to let you know that there was a reaction, I am assuming that&#39;s probably but easiest way to handle it just take Benadryl until it goes away. Is that correct?&#34;. When paraphrased the above concern, consumer stated, &#34;I have already taken Benadryl and it helped and I am just kind of wondering how this will probably last?&#34;. Consumer stated, &#34;Well it is getting better, I mean I don&#39;t need to go to the doctor. I just want to make a report because I know you are trying to get all the information you can on vaccination.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Just when I took it or they gave it to me, is that what you want? 27Jan2021, that is when I received the shot.&#34; Consumer added, &#34;I haven&#39;t received the second one yet. It&#39;s due in February.&#34; Outcome of the events were recovering.

It was hard/where she got the injection; It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge.; Fever blister; heart beating so out of rhythm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing coeliac disease; hypothyroidism, is diabetic and has irregular heartbeat from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism; hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan medoxomil (OLMESARTAN/HCTZ MYLAN) taken for blood pressure measurement; metformin, glipizide and pioglitazone hcl taken for diabetes mellitus; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81) taken for thrombosis; metoprolol taken for heart rate irregular, cyanocobalamin (VIT B12) taken for an unspecified indication, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine, rosuvastatin, vitamin d2, vitamin d3 and potassium, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198, NDC: 59267-1000-1, expiry: unknown) on 27Feb2021 at 1:40PM for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn&#39;t get into them and she didn&#39;t want to go to the ER. She didn&#39;t have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn&#39;t able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded.

A 69-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (at the age of 69-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that patient received Pfizer shot a few weeks before reporting. Within 3 hours her left leg (she was inoculated on the left side) swelled up dramatically - - it was painful. Subsequently - a doctor discovered numerous blood clots in that leg; then a blood clot in one of her lungs. She was being treated but the lymphadenopathy has not subsided in her leg and she was now unable to walk without a cane. Lymphadenopathy was not resolved; the outcome of the other events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 69-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 69-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 08Apr2021 14:30 (Lot Number: EW0151; Expiration Date: 11Apr2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from 2020 and ongoing (fought with it all last year in 2020; but was not diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis until Feb2021), ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (probably really got with it about 2012), Breast cancer survivor from 2006 to 2006, and bone density. Concomitant medications included cyanocobalamin (B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]) taken for an unspecified indication from 16Mar2021 to an unspecified stop date; cortisone (CORTISONE) taken for an unspecified indication from 01Feb2021 to 01Feb2021; methotrexate (METHOTREXATE) taken for rheumatoid arthritis from 06Feb2021 to an unspecified stop date; denosumab (PROLIA) taken for bone density abnormal from 16Mar2021 to an unspecified stop date. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 69-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 12Mar2021 about 16:00-16:30 (Lot Number: EN6204) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced additional swelling in her knees and rheumatoid arthritis. The patient had preexisting condition of Rheumatoid arthritis prior to any Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Prior to onset of this event, with her rheumatoid arthritis, she did not have any rheumatoid arthritis problems in her knees. With the rheumatoid arthritis it has always been in her hands and arms. She was taking Methotrexate for Rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatologist told her that additional swelling in her knees event was rheumatoid arthritis. After second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she reported additional swelling around her waist. She had second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine shot on 08Apr2021. On 11Apr2021 she noticed additional swelling around her waist. She asked if these swelling events are a side effect of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, or in combination with her rheumatoid arthritis. Onset time was about 05:30-06:00 after she took a shower, pretty much the same thing as with the first dose: additional swelling in her knees. She noticed swelling around the waist, going towards the back which didn&#39;t look right on 11Apr2021. There&#39;s no pain at all, it just looks like she has lumps. She has had no other effects from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine other than feels like she is gaining weight. Patient reported no other relevant concomitant products or other medical conditions. She mentioned regarding Methotrexate that they tell her this is a high-quality drug that knocks the immune system down. While providing dates of concomitant product doses caller mentioned she can&#39;t get her brain to work on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events &#34;prior to onset of event she did not have any rheumatoid arthritis problems in her knees&#34; and &#34;more swelling on her waist and back/Additional swelling around her waist/ looks like she has lumps&#34; was not recovered while for the rest of the events was unknown. The event &#34;prior to onset of event she did not have any rheumatoid arthritis problems in her knees&#34; was considered as serious (medically significant).  No follow-up attempts are completed; information about batch/lot cannot be obtained.

                                                Patient received COVID pfizer vaccine at 0801PM. Patient left after 20 minutes after observation. Patient was travelling with husband at the car when she experienced warm/hot cheeks, flushing and concerned with history of previous reaction. When patient arrived ( approximately 835pm), patient sat down on the chair. The redness started to extend to her neck and it was then decided to place the patient to the stretcher. Vitals signs were done in which the BP was 183/104 and 174/101 (845pm). The redness spreaded to her forehead and neck. Benadryl 50mg PO was then given (847pm). Patient BP was taken again which was 182/122 , pulse 80, RR 24 (855pm). Patient then complained about pressure in her throat, eyes (right eyes slightly swollen ) and face. It was then decided that epinephrine (859PM) be used but unfortunately the trainer box was removed so the epinephrine was not actually given. The BP documented was then 193/112 (0859PM). EMS  was then called as the epinephrine was administered per protocol. EMS arrived (0910 PM) and BP at that time was 230/112, pulse 70. Patient was started with heart monitor and IV. EMS then took her to the Emergency across the street with husband.

She had most of the symptoms that she had was when she had Covid. She was sick, she was in bed and could not move. The most severe symptoms were on 13th and slowly each day felt better and it was until Saturday was when she really started to feel a 100 percent herself. Events were reported as non-serious. She had recently lab test within the last month or so. She had two or one and blood and everything was negative, everything was normal.

A 70-years-old female patient started to received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dystonia and migraines from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 antibody test positive from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medication for dystonia and migraines. The patient experienced a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; to her first dose of BNT162B2 in Feb2021. She had all-over body rash that was &#34;very red, like a tomato&#34; and showed up 35-40hours after her dose.  She states her doctor does not recommend she get the second dose. The patient meant by allergic reaction, she had a number of things, she experienced tiredness, injection site pain, joint muscle pain, she felt unwell, this all happened on the Saturday, the same day she got the vaccine on 13Feb2021. Then on Sunday 14Feb2021, all the symptoms she spoke about were still there and so she rested all day. On 15Feb2021, she looked at her elbows, clarifying the inside of elbow, her elbow creases, and on both elbow creases the skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen down to her thigh, it was working it&#39;s way down to the knee, the color was like a beet red, tomato color,  it was under the arms, started with elbow, was at her neck. The more down the redness spread, the more it red in color it also got. When she noticed this she called the doctor. When she called the doctor, the doctor said get over to the Emergency Room right away. Her husband and her were both on the phone and were telling the doctor that she doesn&#39;t want to go to hospital,  she asked if she can just come into the doctors office. The doctor said No. He told her that needs to get special lab work done, and he needs to send her information over to the ER. He said this could do possible damage to the kidneys. The doctor said lets not forget the last time she did a blood test, which was in Nov2020, at that time she came up positive with COVID antibodies. It could have been possible that she had COVID and was asymptomatic, or she had it. The doctor said that they need to do another COVID test or it could be she had a COVID cold or a cold with antibodies, her doctor doesn&#39;t know. The fact that she had that test that came back with COVID antibodies  test but not have COVID in Nov2020 was something to consider. He was concerned may be there is more to this, or just a rash. The doctor said that he is not equipped say what it should be. The doctor said he will speak with them at the hospital. Tiredness subsided yesterday afternoon on 15Feb2021, it subsided before she went to the ER visit. Right now, it&#39;s kind of like a lasting effect because she is not feeling normal. The injection site pain was still there but not as bad. The joint muscle pain subsided this afternoon around 1 o clock. It first began a half hour after leaving the stadium and she was experiencing it while driving back home, the pain continued and got worse. When she got up on Sunday morning her whole body was in pain, she was not getting better on Sunday and that&#39;s when she sat on couch rest of the day. For red skin, with the temperature of the skin, she didn&#39;t feel it to see if it was hot or anything, it was more this feeling that its just not going away getting worse, it didn&#39;t feel hot, there was no texture on the skin either. She just noticed she was flushed red. She called the doctor first, and he said that he was sending information to the emergency room. Then she went to (name of place withheld) ER. They took her temperature, there was no fever. She was then relieved from the ER in 2.5 hours and went home. She still has redness on the skin. In the hospital, they gave her 40 mg of prednisone and an injection or Benadryl, and prescription for prednisone to take for the next 4 days while tapering down. She did take Benadryl about 2 hours ago, she did notice all the sudden she was getting itchy. She is less itchy now. With the itchiness, she just observed this about 2 hours ago. She took Benadryl, she has somewhat improved, she is still itchy but not to the point that she will scratch heavily. She does not have her COVID CDC Card at the moment, her husband has that information but he is on a conference call with a client and she cant disturb him. The patient was scheduled for a second dose on 06Mar2021. That&#39;s where she has a question, the doctor is saying that he is not sure about getting second shot. They took lab work at the hospital and said everything was fine except for white blood cell count, it was on the lower side in Feb2021. She has had no vaccines on the same day or in the 4 weeks prior. She hasn&#39;t had any vaccines. She did have to visit the emergency room. She only called the doctors office, the doctor said not to come in and go tot he ER. She has No relevant family medical history that she would like to share.

                                                Lymph Gland under my left arm became engorged and very swollen.  I would estimate it to be approximately the size of a lemon.  The lymph gland and surrounding tissue became extremely painful to the touch, and remained swollen and painful for 3 days after onset of symptoms

Trunk itches and belly fat feels like someone is squeezing it, swollen hands and feet.  This time had puffy eyes and lips,with neck and genitals itching.  Over my body an erythema that turns white when stroked.  On my right arm, where I received the shot, very large splotch approximately 3 inches by two inches (red and swollen.) Feeling of malaise and dizzy.  Stiff neck and swollen joints in fingers.  Visited outpatient clinic for check up.  Given Hydroxysine HCL 25mg x 3 per day. When I was  in my early 30s had an anaphylactic reaction to something I ate???  Went to ER for shot of epinephrine.  We never discovered what it was I was allergic to.

                                                Within one hour after injection my left side of face started to swell.  The swelling peaked within 24-48 hours and eventually affected my right side as well.  I continue to have a swollen face particularly on left side with whelps particularly near mouth.  I went the an emergency care  facility within the hour on the advice of my Dr.  At that time the swelling was not as bad as it would get.  I was told to take Benadryl the first night and it helped;  I was told I could take Zyrtec or the equivalent generic following the first day.  I continue to be on antihistamines and the swelling remains.  It has been 12 days since the injection.  I want to know if I can safely get my second shot.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

                                                I woke up the morning after receiving the second Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, and the ball joint and toe of my left foot was swollen, red and painful. I ended up taking methylprednisolone (Medrol Dose Pac) for it. A few days after I completed that course of medication, I had another reaction where the left ankle did the same thing, got blood tests and the joint was aspirated; the doctor injected lidocaine and a corticosteroid into the joint, also the Medrol Pac meds again. Seems to be okay now. My doctor considers it a flare of inflammatory arthritis, auto-immune.

The Right Side of my TONGUE and LOWER JAW along the GUM LINE were EDEMATOUS and worsening as was my Right Cheek. I knew immediately what was occurring as I have a HISTORY of ANAPHYLACTIC Response to BEE STINGS and MUSHROOMS.  I have EPI PENS and BENADRYL with me 24/7. I am also a Registered Nurse. I immediately took 50mg of BENADRYL Orally at 0150 hours, and continued to monitor the progression of my symptoms and my vital signs. By 0330 the tingling in my face and jaw abated.  The Edema began to lessen at approximately 0610.  I DID NOT have to use one of my EPI PENS. I DID NOT make an Emergency Visit to the ER, nor to my physician. (pt also noted she attempted to send in four (4 ) VAERS Reporting Forms to know avail.  I kept receiving &#34;ERROR&#34; COULD NOT SEND&#34; messages and she called the VAERS telephone line 9 times, and left messages with no response).

                                                Immediately upon injection I felt totally dizzy as though I was drunk, slight pain at base of tongue left side. The dizziness somewhat passed within 40 minutes but not totally, same with slight pain at base of tongue left side. Went to bed as normal but awoke to having great difficulty breathing as soft tissue around entire neck was swollen as were lymph glands around neck area, that was pressing against my airway making it seem like I was suffocating slowly, being strangled by all the swelling. Hospital injected me with mega dose cocktail of large amount of steroids, Benadryl.  Symptoms subsided quite a bit at hospital only to keep continuing for nearly 2 weeks after. Because of this on Tues March 2, 2021 I had an appointment with my family doctor because the swelling was still quite intense. She put me on a 3-5 day dose of Prednisone.  I still have some swelling going on in my neck area from it today 3/20/21.  On item 21 I clicked Permanent damage as I&#39;m unsure if this swelling will be permanent and continue to come and go at this time or totally subside eventually. It&#39;s unknown at this time.

                                                This was 2nd dose. Starting before I sat down in the observation area: Pressure and pain at back of neck, dizziness, difficulty swallowing. This persisted until 3/17. I had a similar reaction to the first dose. 3/15: Rash on face and neck. 3/16 Rash spread to chest and upper arms. 3/17 face swollen; headache, scratchy throat.  3/18: Symptoms subside by end of day, although skin still a little blotchy. I did tell the person who gave me the injection about my reaction to the first dose and she looked for the rapid response team to watch me, but she didn&#39;t find them. I suggest a sign in the waiting area indicating which symptoms are of concern (hard to distinguish immune response from allergy and/or anxiety attack.

                                                Swollen upper arm and tender for 2 days after the injection.  The ringworm rash seemed to spread like wildfire on the third day and within a couple of days, both my legs were covered with the blotches.  I had continued using the tolnaftate but on Saturday the 13th of March I went to get medical advise at the local ER and was told to take Allegra and Clotrimazole-Betamethazone cream.  The rash got worse and I called Dr. and he told me to contniue to take the Allegra but stop the cream and start with Lotrimin because the Betamethazone in the cream counteracts the positive effects of the Clotrimazole.

Medical history included breast cancer from 1988 to an unknown date , ovarian cancer from 2015 to an unknown date , she has had lymph nodes removed from her right arm &#34;30 years ago&#34; from 1988 to an unknown date, pass out from unknown date to unknown date. Concomitant medication included olaparib (LYNPARZA) taken for ovarian cancer from Feb2020 at 150mg, 2 tablets in the morning and 1-2 tablets at night by mouth.She says she is a little person and couldn&#39;t tolerate the side effects of that, so she varies how many she takes based on her side effects. She says she is supposed to take 300mg in the morning and 300mg at night. She says how she takes it is, she takes 150mg or one pill in the morning, then one or two at night depending on how she is doing. Historical vaccine information included BNT162B2 dose 1, lot no: EL9264, route left arm for Covid-19 immunisation. Past drug history included on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out. The patient reported approximately 15 hours after the shot, on 21Feb2021 she had muscle spasms almost to seizure amount of shaking, full body muscle spasms. She clarifies that her side effects didn&#39;t kick in until 02:30AM on 21Feb2021. She says at 07:00AM on 21Feb2021 she got up and went into the bathroom and passed out, and had a low blood sugar episode she supposed.  She crashed unconscious to the floor. She said that could be from the shot, but she is also a high risk patient, a cancer patient, and is on a maintenance chemo drug. She says on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out, so she doesn&#39;t know if that was related to the COVID shot or not. No testing had been done on high risk patients, so she thought maybe this could be a good heads up for something someone else may experience. Her side effects were on and off for several hours, the shaking and spasms would subside and then start again. She says that they went away, and then she got up and passed out, and her foot was all messed up, she doesn&#39;t know what she did when she fell, but she had it checked and it was not broken, it was all bruised and swollen, but it was not broken. She says this was her right foot. She says she thinks she fell backwards, and she thinks she caught her foot under the vanity. On unknown date, she experienced bruising of foot, fatigue, foot was all messed up/it was all bruised and swollen, but it was not broken. She says this was her right foot. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                70 y/o female of Asian descent developed a mild, pruritic, hive-like rash on her left arm and leg about 2 days (21 Jan 2021) after receipt of her 2nd BioNTech vaccine (injected in her left arm; no other vaccines given on that day). Patient did not self-treat. Rash continued on 26 Jan when patient was evaluated in Medical Center  ER  described as &#34;3 small wheals located on left upper and lower extremity with excoriations&#34;; she was treated with Benadryl 25 mg orally and the itching decreased and the rash significantly diminished. No other signs or symptoms concerning for allergic reaction. Patient also reports onset of muscle aches, starting within 48 hours of vaccine receipt; also reports onset of fatigue, headache, and feeling hot.  The headache and feeling hot resolved within 72 hours, but fatigue and muscle aches continued. Reports muscles hurt in her arms legs, and chest.  Around 22 Jan, patient began having diffuse joint pain in her extremities. The pain became significantly worse on Sun, 24 Jan. Patient self-treated with Ibuprofen with some relief. By 26 Jan, when patient sought evaluation at ER, she described the joint pain as &#34;unbearable&#34; and rated pain intensity as 9/10. In the ER, patient was afebrile and her exam noted: bilateral hand and wrist swelling (left&gt;right), but no redness or warmth at joints; full ROM, but pain increased with movements. Diagnosed as reactive arthritis and prescribed Tiger Balm and Lidocaine patches, with continued Ibuprofen recommended.  At follow-up appointment with patient&#39;s PCM on 29 Jan, she reported continued muscle and joint pains. She reported some relief with topical analgesics and Ibuprofen, but Ibuprofen upset her stomach, so was changed to Celecoxib 200 mg twice daily as needed. Topicals and Benadryl were renewed. (Benadryl helped rash, but patient ran out and had recurrence of pruritic rash.) Muscle pain continued in her extremities. Reported fair control of muscle pain with topical analgesics and Celecoxib. Reported having &#34;muscle spasms&#34; in her hands. Patient reported increased sensitivity  painful sensation when she touched something cold. Reported using a pot holder to hold a cold can of soda to reduce pain.  Joint pain primarily in hands, wrists, shoulders, feet, ankles, and knees. Reported swelling of hands and wrists resolved after about 2 weeks. She also had swelling of her left foot, which resolved. Reported some relief of joint pain with topical analgesics and Celecoxib, but joint pain interfering with sleep. Patient&#39;s fatigue continued. Spouse describes as decreased stamina. An example:  they used to go out to do errands over a 2-hour period and it would not impact patient&#39;s energy level; now, after 2 hours of minimal-to-moderate activity, patient is exhausted.  Follow-up with PCM on 8 and 18 Mar 2021  rash resolved, but generalized muscle aches and joint pains continue.  No localized joint swelling. Full ROM. Labs ordered (see below)  patient&#39;s Rheumatoid Factor was elevated; she is pending a Rheumatology evaluation (appointment on 17 April). No history of recent trauma or injury. No previous history of similar joint pain. No history of arthritis or Rheumatic disease.   Not previously diagnosed with COVID and never tested positive for COVID; was quarantined in 2020 after returning from being on a cruise ship. After 1st COVID vaccine in Dec, she experienced a headache and local redness and tenderness at vaccination site, lasting less than 3 days.

This 70-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6200, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 18Feb2021, 12:00 pm at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 70 years). The patient was not pregnant. Medical history included colon polyps and diverticulosis. Allergies to medications, food, or other products included premarin, ambien and many seasonal allergies. Co-suspect medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AUGMENTIN) for diverticulitis. Concomitant medication patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included acebutolol hydrochloride (SECTRAL), allopurinol, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) and amitriptyline. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9262, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 28Jan2021, 13:00 pm at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 70 years). No other vaccine was received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 18 Mar2021, 4 weeks after second vaccine, the patient took Augmentin for recurring diverticulitis. For the last few years, the patient has taken the Augmentin once or twice a year to treat the problem (alternative to the flagyl/cipro regimine) and she have never had any problems. This time, on the 3rd day of the Augmentin, the patient broke out in large hives, (palm sized) and had swollen earlobes and a swollen palm on her right hand. The next day on 19Mar2021 she had swollen upper and lower lips. The patient took lots of Benadryl and Zyrtec, and by the 5th day her hives and horrendous itching went away. The patient does not know if the vaccine played any role in this at all. She just thought she should report since prior to the vaccine she never had a problem with Augmentin. The patient had absolutely no reaction at all to the Pfizer Covid vaccine itself after either of the doses. No covid prior vaccination and no covid tested post vaccination was reported. The outcome of all the events was recovered on an unknown date in Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                hives; face swelling; itching; rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 71-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EH9899), intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 11:08 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing depression. Concomitant medication included atenolol (tablet, strength 50 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for blood pressure high, simvastatin (tablet, strength 20 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for cholesterol, paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL, tablet, strength 40 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for depression. The patient experienced hives, face swelling, itching and rash on 27Dec2020. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. She got the first Covid 19 dose on 22Dec2020 and was fine, then on 27Dec2020 she had hives, itching, and face swelling for several days. Caller stated her lungs were clear and she was okay other than the extreme itching. The face swelling was what worried her. The hives and itching went away within about 36 hours. The face swelling kind of got worse for a couple of days before it went away. Caller verifies she recovered from the hives/rash/itching within 36 hours. She got a steroid shot and things like that and it went away pretty quickly. The face swelling was completely gone but did last for a good 5 days. She didn&#39;t know if this reaction was related to the vaccine. She wanted to call and let Pfizer know and see if there was any reports of anything else like that or similar to that type of reaction. She was not sure if that really matters or not except she was not sure about taking the booster. She was kind of leaning towards taking the second vaccine. She didn&#39;t have any breathing issues. She asked as far as the second dose after those side affects, was it recommended? Her doctor said she could get the second one and prescribed her an Epi pen and would give a dose of Benadryl at the time of the second vaccine. She may take some Benadryl before getting the second vaccine and have her EpiPen with her just in case. She hadn&#39;t seen her doctor about this experience with the COVID-19 vaccine. She only went to an urgent care. The caller stated she went to urgent care twice. She received a steroid shot but doesn&#39;t have any name, NDC/UPC, Lot number or expiration date for any of the medication she received. She probably threw that paperwork out. She knew she wasn&#39;t given anything the second time she went to the urgent care. The second time she went back was because the face swelling was getting worse. She was prescribed an EpiPen and was told to take Zyrtec which did help. Everything had gone away. She would consider these events to be medically significant because of the face swelling, it kind of scared her. She made the comment she was taking high blood pressure medicine and cholesterol medicine, but other than that she was very healthy. She was not really an allergic person. She had not had any testing done since she received the vaccine. She did have bloodwork done prior but not since the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work prior vaccine with unknown result. The outcome of hives, rash and itching was recovered on an unspecified date of Dec2020 (within about 36 hours); face swelling was recovered on 01Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time gap between the vaccine and the events there is not a reasonable possibility that the reported events were related to the suspect product,  events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

She felt comfortable returning home- husband picked her up.    I will call her to check in this evening and in the morning and will provide updated recommendations regarding second dose of vaccination.     I spoke with patient at 8:09 pm - she was at home- feeling much better, however, she did take the second diphenhydramine on the way home, as she began to feel she was having some swelling between her eyes.  No SOB  Or trouble swallowing.  This improved with the second benedryl and has not recurred.    She will take an additional 50 mg benedryl before bed, and then she awakes before 6 am- if she has any residual symptoms she will take another dose.  Again, she understands to seek emergency care with any worsening symptoms, or new SOB or facial swelling. She can also use her EPI pen if needed.  She felt comfortable with this plan.    We also reviewed current CDC guidelines and she understands at this time we would not recommend she receive the second Vaccination.  She will continue to follow CDC in the event that this recommendation changes.  I will submit a VAERS report after following up with her in the morning.     ADDENDUM 2/3/21:  I spoke with patient again on 2/3/21 at 07:45 am. She is feeling almost completely back to baseline this morning, but planning to take 25 mg diphenhydramine this morning as well. She does note mild headache, which is not abnormal for her.  No residual tongue sensitivity or facial swelling.  She noted that when she got home last night, she felt very sleepy and sedated from the diphenhydramine and went to bed, and did not take an additional dose of diphenhydramine last night.  No SOB, trouble swallowing or any new complaint.  No urticaria or itching.    We reviewed current CDC recommendations to decline second vaccination given her moderate severe allergic symptoms within first 4 hours of first vaccination.  She will follow up with PCP or kidney specialist if she has any continued concern with ongoing symptoms or new issues.  She was very appreciative of the followup and care provided.

Took benedry tablets and allegra cream. 2/3/21  woke up with puffy face.  Still had redness and itchy. Contacted nurse association suggested fill out this form and contact my doctor. my doctor said go to urgent care clinic.  I decided to call my dermatologist who I will meet with today.  Note:  Not sure if this is reaction to vaccination - I have never had an adverse reaction to taking any type of vaccine.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes; Lymph nodes are really itchy/The itching is worse/worsened; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer via medical information team. A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), intramuscularly on the left arm on 09Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes: diagnosed before 2000, the condition was controlled; ongoing blood pressure high: diagnosed about the same time as the diabetes (before 2000), the condition was controlled; breast cancer twice: first time she had breast cancer was in 2008, the second time was in 2017; and had surgery and lymph nodes were removed: four lymph nodes were removed on the side where the shot was done (left). There patient had no concomitant medications. On 19Jan2021, the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes, lymph nodes were really itchy and the itching is worse/worsened in Jan2021. The patient received the COVID vaccine 10 days ago (also reported as almost 2 weeks ago) and experienced swollen lymph nodes. The vaccine was given to her in the same arm where she had her lymph nodes removed. She added that within the last 2 days, her lymph nodes on one side were swelling and really itchy. She added that &#34;it&#39;s itchy to the point she would like to rip her arm off&#34;. The patient was scheduled to have her second dose on the 30th. It was explained to her that she shouldn&#39;t have a problem with getting the second dose, but the vaccine was injected into her left arm and that was the side where her lymph nodes were removed and now it was itchy. The swelling and itching started first thing in the morning on the 19Jan2021, she woke up with it. The itching was worse, or she doesn&#39;t know actually. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s worse or its just annoying because it has now been 2 days of it. The itching and swelling hasn&#39;t gotten any better. Initially she was thinking it was a bug bite. She was thinking it would be better today, but its not. She wanted to make sure it had nothing to do with her breast cancer. The consumer wanted to know how long it took for the swollen lymph nodes to go down and should she take the second dose of the vaccine. She also wanted to know if she should take BENADRYL or apply any ointment on the swollen lymph nodes. The adverse event did not require a visit to the emergency room or the physician office. No relevant tests were done. The patient has not recovered from the events.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  This 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EK9231), via an unknown route, on 19Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. No relevant medical history and concomitant medications were provided. On 22Jan2021, the patient developed an anaphylactic reaction. She went to the doctor and he was reluctant to give her steroids which was the normal way of treating the anaphylactic reactions because he said that the steroid would interfere with the effect of the vaccine. So, he gave her diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). She had to go back to the emergency room later that day and they used epinephrine (EPIPEN) and she had to have an intravenous (IV) and other than that some medications, it had prednisolone in it. Then she had to go back yesterday and she had another IV and they sent her home with an EPIPEN. The event was assessed serious as medically significant. The patient had recovered from the event in Jan2021.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 (at the age of 71-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination and started to receive methotrexate (ACCORD HEALTHCARE, lot number unknown, expiration date 12Nov2021) on an unspecified date (reported as seven years ago) at a dose of 17.5 mg weekly (seven tablets once a week) for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from an unspecified date. Historical vaccinations included &#34;every vaccine known. I&#39;ve had all my vaccines, flu whatever&#34;  (as reported) on unspecified dates. It was unknown if the patient had received any other vaccinationa in the fourteen days prior to this inoculation. Concomitant medications included folic acid (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). On 18Jan2021 (reported as about five days after the shot), the patient had just a little soreness and she thought that was one of the side effects that you have that with the vaccine. So, she didn&#39;t worry so much about it. But then it got progressively worse. And by the time just before she was supposed to get the second shot, it was really bad. But she thought that she was still going to get that second shot which was planned for &#34;02Feb2021 or 03Feb2021&#34; (also reported as on 02Feb2021) because she didn&#39;t want to not get it.  She was struggling with the pain before she got the second one. She mentioned that by the time she got her second dose, she was in an RA flare. She continued by saying that she had her blood work done, &#34;on Tuesday morning&#34;  because she was due for her RA exam in Mar and it was due, and her markers for ESR, and &#34;CR whatever&#34;  were more than double what they should be. Her Rheumatololgist saw her and when she went to the doctor her shoulders, her ankles, her elbows and everything were all hot with flare ups. Treatment included Prednisone 10mg every day which was given, according to the patient,  in order to &#34;calm down my joints and everything.&#34; The action taken with methotrexate was not reported. The clinical outcomes Rheumatoid Arthritis flare up, pain, condition aggravated, ESR increased and CRP increased were reported as unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Rheumatoid arthritis flare up, ESR increased, and CRP increased cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                48 hours after shot in left arm I started to have a earache on left side, traveled down the left side of face, into jaw area and down left side of my throat like tonsils and into neck area.  Into 72 hours after shot my face, neck and throat area started swelling.  At that time I went to ER for assistance due to the swelling and pain.  The ER after taking  review thought it a infected saliva gland and treated me for that.  As told by ER if no large progress contact my local Dr. and see ENT.  On Tues. (one week from Covid injection) I was in touch with my local  Dr. they had me come to their office for some care and scheduled me with a ENT.  They have been able to get the profuse swelling down out of the left side of my face, neck and throat.  I&#39;m scheduled for a CT scan on March 5, 2021 to see where the original problem started.  I&#39;m contacting  you for two reason&#39;s  1.  I have a March 10th. appointment scheduled I need to cancel and am having issues doing this.  Even in light of all this I want to reschedule for late April for my second shot and am not able to do that as well.   2.  Can you assist with any information if this has happened to other folks and if I should be clear to take my second dose.  This has been quite a nightmare and hard to bring under control.  I believe in the vaccine and this maybe just a quirk in how it happened but any information you can give me would be welcome.  I have looked on the website and it does say that there have been people who have also had symptoms like this from the shots where the side they get the shot on reacts.  Thanking you in advance for your time and assistance.

                                                This patient developed a severe, multisystem inflammatory syndrome after covid vaccination that necessitated hospitalization for 6 days. It involved skin (rash), liver (elevated bilirubin and asT/alt), bone marrow (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), cns (hallucinations, visual disturbance), and musculoskeletal system (synovitis). Inflammatory markers were markedly elevated with ferritin over 1000 and CRP over 100. COVID infection was definitively excluded.

                                                After waiting 30 minutes after my injection, I left the hospital and was driving home when I began to feel my face tingling and swelling. This was close to 45 minutes after the injection. I was not sure what I was feeling, but had a similar reaction to the first Shingles shot so I was monitoring what I felt. I went to a walk in clinic about 2 hours after this feeling began. The swelling was on the right side of my face from a midline of my top lip to my right cheek. The doctor I saw told me to take Benadryl and gave me scripts for a Medrol Dosepak and epi pens. I took the Benadryl and got through the evening. I took Benadryl on Saturday and stopped it on Sunday. My face was still puffy, but no worse. Sunday night, my face felt worse and I took the Benadryl again. Monday morning, my face was slightly more swollen. I decided to start the Medrol Dosepak. My face was not feeling good and my throat felt like I was swallowing a boulder when I ate making me think  that my throat might be closing up a bit. I decided to use the epi pen, gave myself the shot, got the shakes from the shot, and went to the emergency room as instructed on the pen. My blood pressure was very high arriving at the hospital which was from the epi pen. I was watched at the hospital, the epi pen had done it&#39;s work, and I went home 4 1/2 hours later. I have had continued puffiness in my face. I have been given Famotidine to add to the Benadryl as I had with the shingles vaccine reaction. This Wednesday after getting the shot on the previous Friday.

                                                The patient initially presented (3/3/21) with headache, fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, malaise. Patient related she was in her normal state of health and only started to feel poorly after she received her second COVID-19 vaccination three days earlier.  She interestingly related that after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination she had significant burning in her stomach that she noted but no other major symptoms and notably did not experience this severe burning in her stomach after the second dose. She denied any chest pain, current dyspnea, productive cough, sore throat, urinary symptoms, sick contacts.  She has no history of C. difficile, no recent antibiotics, no recent spoiled foods, no recent travel, no history of radiation.  She does have a history of GERD and has had gastritis with mild gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and undergone EGD negative for H. pylori infection.  She also has undergone colonoscopies with polyps that have been removed and reported as tubular adenomas.  As her hospitalization progressed, she was diagnosed with Severe Sepsis due to E. Coli bacteremia in setting of liver abscess, Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Transaminitis (which resolved). Patient was appropriately treated for these conditions. Also, her known uncontrolled diabetes was treated. Per an Infection Disease note on 3/9/21: The patient has had hx of biliary colic (self diagnosis) now with discovery of non-obstructive cholelithiasis on RUQ US it is plausible that the abscess originated from self limiting cholecystitis/cholangitis which would be consistent with recent abdominal pain exacerbated with oral intake. Difficult to state definitively any relation to COVID-19 vaccination, though may have resulted from associated dehydration.

Medical history included low magnesium, low vitamin D, allergy to Band-Aids, skin adhesives, and allergy to polyurethane spray tan (She&#39;s had a reaction to polyurethane on wood floors at her dad&#39;s house. Her throat started tightening and it was hard to breathe. She couldn&#39;t be in the house until they were finished with the floors. She had to stay in a hotel. She&#39;s also had a reaction to spray tan. After the spray tan was finished she had the tightness in her throat. She went to the emergency department and was given Benadryl and her reaction stopped after a short amount of time), She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; magnesium taken for low magnesium from an unspecified start date and ongoing; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D) taken for vitamin D decreased, start and stop date were not reported. The patient had allergy to Polysporin (Johnson and Johnson NDC30036385, Lot#103812, Expiry Jan2020), Polysporin caused a bad skin reaction, it was awful. She can only use plain bacitracin. Some make ups she can&#39;t use. She&#39;s had no problems with creams. Foods are ok. She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years ago and she put the polysporin on the wound and that&#39;s when she had that reaction. It was bad around the incision, that wound took a long time to heal because of that sensitivity. She also can&#39;t take zinc oxide because it caused an allergic skin reaction, she also had allergy to Epinephrine, She had a reaction happen to her at the dentist. She was given epinephrine and her heart started pounding and racing. The dentist put her in a shock position. The dentist told her it would pass but it was scary. The patient previously also received Antihistamine for allergy. The patient experienced heart started pounding and racing (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, high blood pressure 220/118 (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, throat felt funny (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, allergic reaction/anaphylactic reaction (medically significant) on 23Mar2021. Events were considered as related to Covid 19 Vaccine by reporter. Event required a visit to Emergency Room. The clinical course as following: She received her first Covid 19 vaccine yesterday, on 23Mar2021. After she received the Covid 19 vaccine she walked down the hall to wait in the other room. When she sat down in the other room her heart started pounding and racing. The nurse took her pulse and took her blood pressure. The nurse asked her if she had high blood pressure and she does not have high blood pressure, she has low blood pressure. And the nurse told her that her pulse was fast. A second nurse came in to recheck her blood pressure and she got a high reading as well. The nurses called the nurse practitioner in also. The nurse practitioner said the caller should go to the emergency department. Her throat also felt funny but not bad. She has had reactions in the past when her throat got tight. In the emergency department she received 2 Benadryl, 50mg of Benadryl. They checked her out in the emergency department. The doctor checked her out. She was hooked up to monitor and she stayed for 4-5 hours in the emergency department in case there was a rebound effect. She was discharged from the emergency department. She reports her pulse was 118 beats per minute. She felt like it was higher than that. Her blood pressure was 220/118 the first time. She takes her blood pressure at home and it runs 118-120 over 68-72. The sensation after the Covid 19 vaccine was her heart started pounding. Her heart was moving she could see it pounding. She asked the emergency room doctor what does she do about the second Covid 19 vaccine. She is scheduled for the second Covid 19 vaccine on 15Apr2021. The doctor told her he wasn&#39;t sure about that. The doctor advised her to call the CDC and let them know what&#39;s going on. She did not speak to anyone at the CDC, she left her contact information for a call back. She found the number for Pfizer and called it. The symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours before the pulse came down to the 90&#39;s (beats per minute). The blood pressure came down quicker then the pulse did. Probably within the hour her blood pressure was down to 158 over something. In the emergency department she was instructed to take Benadryl 25mg every 6 hours for 24-48 hours. She&#39;s not back to her perky self, but her heart rate and blood pressure is normal. She took 25mg of Benadryl last night, 23Mar2021 then 25mg of Benadryl this morning, 24Mar2021. She&#39;s not taking it right at every 6 hours. And she&#39;ll take the Benadryl for only 24 hours. She reports it&#39;s unnerving for this to happen to her. It helped her that her blood pressure was coming down and they didn&#39;t have to give her any other medication besides the Benadryl. She felt like she was in a safe place in the emergency department. She kept drinking water the whole time, she likes to drink a lot of water and she also did some deep breathing exercises. She gets anxious when things like this happen to her. She felt this was medically significant because she didn&#39;t know what caused it. Is something in the vaccine that might have caused this to happen. When probing for relevant tests, she reports she had no tests done in the emergency department. They only maintained her on a heart rate monitor and took her blood pressure. She had no IV or anything like that. All the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction was described as high blood pressure, heart was racing, throat felt funny. Time of onset was minutes after receiving the vaccine, symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours. Patient require medical intervention included Antihistamine, Benadryl 50mg. Patient seen in the Emergency Department, she was monitored in the emergency department for about 4-5 hours on a heart rate monitor and had her blood pressure taken. The patient was not hospitalized. Organ involvement Cardiovascular: Hypertension 220/118, Tachycardia 118 beats per minute. The event was not required the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. Patient&#39;s outcome following the potential anaphylactic reaction was Recovering. No laboratory tests or diagnostic studies performed. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the event being reported. The patient hasn&#39;t received any other vaccines around the time of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported anaphylactic reaction described as high blood pressure, palpitation and oropharyngeal discomfort was likely causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events.

                                                About 30 minutes after 2nd vaccine, I felt abrupt pain, shocks and tightening in 3 fingers on my right hand, starting at the knuckles down to finger tips. Pain occurred with or without movement.  Knuckles are swollen on that  On day 4, pain moved from knuckle to the joint between knuckle and finger tip.  Pain occurs mostly with movement but not always, and is from mild to moderate pain. It is day 16 post vaccine, and I still have intermittent pain in the 3 fingers  where I hadn?t previously had any prior to vaccine. 30 hrs after 2nd vaccine, I also had a severe headache lasting about 1 1/2 hrs.

                                                71- year old woman with past medical significant for hypertension on 10 mg of Lisinopril daily for many years. She had her first dose of Pfizer vaccine two weeks prior to admission (3/11/21). After her vaccination, patient felt unwell and dizzy in the mornings. She felt persistent fatigue and had a decreased appetite. The week prior to admission she noticed a decrease in her urine output. She denied NSAID use. Her primary care physician ordered blood week and her Cr was found to be 16.54 and BUN of 163, phosphate of 17.5. Her last known Cr prior to her admission was 18 months prior and was 1.17. She was asked to present to the emergency room. Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis or stones. Urinalysis showed 1&#43; protein, spec grav of 1.023 with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 0.09. Urine sediment was unremarkable. Her temperature was 95.6 and her BP was as low as 75/46 and she was put on a low dose of levo. CRP was 202.3. COVID was negative. CK wnl.  ANA &#43; to 1:160 (dsDNA, Smith, RNP, SS-A, SS-B all negative). Blood smear was negative. Cultures were all negative. Echo showed an EF of 68% with trivial pericardial effusion. Patient was oliguric, and then initiated on hemodialysis. Renal biopsy was performed.   The biopsy consists of one fragment which is stained with H&amp;E, PAS, Trichrome, Jones Silver, and HPS stains. Review of all stains reveals 12 glomeruli, one of which is globally sclerotic. The architecture of the kidney is well-preserved. There is  interstitial fibrosis with proportional atrophy involving 10% of the biopsy tissue. There is a focal interstitial infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes involving &lt;5% of the interstitium. The tubules show diffuse acute tubular injury.  Calcium oxalate  crystals are present in seven tubular profiles. The glomeruli show expansion of Bowman&#39;s capsule. The mesangium shows normal cellularity. The vessels show no abnormalities.   IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY:   Frozen sections are stained for IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1q, kappa, lambda, and fibrinogen. All immunofluorescence stains are negative.   ELECTRON MICROSCOPY:   Specimens are prepared for electron microscopy and semi-thin sections stained with toluidine blue are reviewed prior to thin sectioning for ultrastructural examination. Electron microscopy demonstrates patent capillary loops. The glomerular architecture  demonstrates segmental corrugation of basement membranes with increase in lamina rara interna.  No subepithelial deposits and no intramembranous deposits are identified. The tubules show dilated mitochondria and injury. There is segmental effacement of  foot processes. There are no subendothelial deposits. Mesangial electron dense deposits are not identified.   Patient received three dialysis treatments and Creatinine began to improved down to 1.46 within 8 days.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 71-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 10Apr2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS), tamsulosin, and iron. The patient got her first injection on Saturday, 10Apr2021 at 1:30 pm in the afternoon around 7 o&#39;clock the same day she started to itch, it was mild across her breast and stomach but her thighs and bottom legs were turning red, swelling, hives there too, and she rubbed alcohol (treatment) on this to stop the itch, that seems to helped a little bit, but the swelling was not that bad today but the redness was still there. She has scabs on her, blood was coming through, and slight bee stings all over and thigh on an unspecified date, she used hydrocortisone cream (treatment), she was lucky she have some of that here because she keep that when going or here but she rubbed that on last night and that was the only way that she was able to get some sleep. The patient doesn&#39;t think that she was going to get the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to experience that again. It feels like that today it was not that bad itching today but at 71 that was miserable yesterday so probably she would not get the second shot. She hopes that the first one can protect her to a point, but she cannot subject herself to that again, that would be senseless for her to experience that again and get a second shot. The patient also stated that her eyelids have been a little itchy too so hopefully you all understand it was 71 years old was suffering from that kind of misery second time. The patient was unable to probe the more question, patient was in pain and not willing to proceed. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Medical history included shortness of breath, asthma. Concomitant medications included albuterol (SALBUTAMOL) and budesonide/formoterol fumarate (inhalation aerosol). Patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 25Feb2021 at the age of 71 years for covid-19 immunisation and she did fine. Patient stated that lot number for shot 2 looked like EDOL71. It could be ENOL71. The lady didn&#39;t write it very well. It could be EN or ED. She was calling to report she had a terrible side effect and she want to document it in the data. She couldn&#39;t give that to computer right now, she didn&#39;t feel well, she had the Pfizer shot 1 and Pfizer shot 2. She had anaphylaxis at 30 minutes and almost she had crashed her car just after the highway. First shot was February 25, she did fine, the second shot was April 22nd and she had a horrible reaction at 30 min. Patient stated that the problem is they didn&#39;t asked her if she was short of breath or if she had any pulmonary complication and so on the second shot she didn&#39;t say anything and she forgot to say she has asthma and no one asked her. she forgot to say and so they had her sit in 15min observation and she was fine and she had gone out after she got her vaccination record card sign, she got in her car and 15min. Later while she was driving she went into anaphylaxis. She had to pull over, thank god she didn&#39;t hit anybody, she pulled over and parked and she had her inhaler with her so she used the inhaler and she got in the back seat for half an hour to make sure that she drove home, she did not call 911. Patient further stated that she wanted to put it in documentation, if someone is taking something for asthma that probably should not have the second shot one medication is not good enough, the second dose and she also woke up in the evening drenched with sweat and chills, completely sweat and that happened about 8 to 10 hours after the shot on 22Apr2021. After the shot at 12:15 pm and she had the sweat about 11 O&#39;clock at night when she had to lay down and she was shaking so badly she thought she was going to call 911, she was that sick. That&#39;s scary, patient stated &#34;I must, I did have crashed in 3 or 4 people during that.&#34; So, it was very dangerous to someone who has asthma. That was probably something in the medication that she was allergic to. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the anaphylaxis.

During the night, I couldn&#39;t get comfortable because my left arm pit started to hurt and could tell it was somewhat swollen.  Woke up next morning and I had a low grade fever and my lymph nodes were tender and hurt to touch.  Fever lasted all day &amp; into the late night day after vaccine, but the arm pit lymph nodes lasted three and a half days.  They are still a bit tender but not swollen today (02/10/2021). I had NO body aches but a little chills.

When I arrived at home the burning increased with redness  I reported this information on Tuesday 1/26/21 to the provider of the vaccine. I was told to take Benadryl which I did immediately.  On Wednesday, I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours. On Thursday, my face continued to burn with redness and a rash.  I then started to get a low grade fever and it appeared my face was swelling and then we decided to go to Urgent Care.  The Doctor said my face was swollen and gave me a 1/2 dose of a steroid shot and a prescription for steroid pills.   I saw my Primary Care Doctor 2/8/21 and he said I should not get the second dose of the vaccine.

My doctor examined me and asked me some questions about when I first felt the lump and how was I feeling, etc.  I told her I had my second vaccine three days prior.  She gave me a prescription for bloodwork which is part of my annual exam process along with an appointment to see me again on March 16th.   I had the bloodwork yesterday morning.

                                                Starting 24 hours after her second dose (Wed), patient experienced fever, chills, body aches, and headaches throughout Thursday and Friday On Saturday she noticed a little &#39;movable lump&#39; on her lower right jaw (opposite side from vaccine site). By Monday the lump had grown to 3.5cm. That day she saw a doctor who examined her and was uncertain if the lump was due to the vaccine. She had a CBC taken that day that came back normal. Nothing was prescribed.  Since Monday, the lump is still hard, slightly tender, and sometimes warm to the touch, but it has been getting smaller. Pt notes her temperature has been slightly higher than normal for her (~98.3&#39;) but otherwise she feels fine and the lump does not impede her swallowing, breathing, or talking.

                                                On March 12, I experienced some pain in left hand.  By the next day, my hand was somewhat swollen, stiff and I had trouble grasping items.  The pain was worse on March 14, to the point that I could barely move my hand.  My arm from below my elbow  was also sore.  I took Tylenol and, later, aspirin.  My hand was swollen and the veins appeared dark through the skin.  My hand felt cold and applying warm compresses helped ease the. pain.  By March 15, the pain started to go away and by March 16, my hand and arm were back to normal.

Then driving home she started feeling itchy, and could feel little hives in each ear.  She was then very lethargic that night and all the next day Sunday, and then first thing Monday morning was covered with a large hives and a rash.  She was covered from one end of her body to the other and into her joints where she was not able to bend her joints.  She tried to use cortisone, but that made it worse.  Also tried Benadryl lotion and Calamine lotion, which also did not help.  She then went to the doctor and he prescribed steroids.  She has had pain as if somebody was sticking needles in her.  In the past 2 days her lips are numb and swelled, and on the right cheek plus her two eyes there is a big swollen area and her eyes are burning.  Now her entire body is peeling as if she had a bad sunburn.   Now her blood sugar due to the steroids is from 250-475.  The site of the vaccine itself was ok.

Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 13Mar2021 15:00, the patient noticed slight swelling of right foot and on 14Mar2021, the swelling increased so the patient texted the nurse who arranged appointment. The nurse said to contact the doctor and the patient spoke with registered nurse (RN) on duty who told the patient to go to the emergency room (ER) because the symptoms indicated the problem was a blood clot. The ER doctor examined and ordered an ultrasound and the results confirmed blood clot. The patient was given a prescription for blood thinner to take for 21 days (times/day, 15mg) and was told to make an appointment with the primary doctor. The patient&#39;s doctor was on spring break and she was walked in to see another doctor who said swelling looked improved and showed her where the clots were located. The patient saw her primary doctor today and she ordered a visit with a hematologist as soon as possible (ASAP) because of concerns about possible underlying issues. The outcome of events, slight swelling of right foot and the problem was a blood clot was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

The patient has been diagnosed with AML back in 2016 and underwent several lines of therapy including chemotherapy with 7 and 3 and the last treatment was decitabine with maintenance treatment with ivosidenib.  Having severe leukocytosis and right-sided leg edema with DVT raised concern about  blast crisis and leukostasis. Patient was admitted to hospital and received. ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible pneumonia.  She underwent leukophoresis on the 4/6/2021, 4/7/2021. Patient received IV heparin gtt for DVT but later on was on hold given worsening thrombocytopenia. She was transferred from one hospital to another hospital.  I do not think the development of DVT was due to COVID vaccine. But prior to COVID vaccine, patient was in AML remission.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8733, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 29Mar2021 11:45, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing latex allergy (developed welts where the straps met the skin) diagnosed 20-30 years ago; ongoing dye allergy (developed warm soreness to leg, tightness in the chest, could not breathe) diagnosed many years ago; sulphite allergy (diagnosed about 1975-1980; cannot eat processed foods, bleached foods, frozen pre-made foods; tries to eat only single item foods; last anaphylactic reaction after eating olive oil at a restaurant because it had sulphites in it; Mother was possibly allergic to sulphites; Son also allergic to sulphites); and blood pressure that runs low. The patient previously took epinephrine and experienced epinephrine allergy; ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and experienced Cipro Allergy (eyes closed, got puffy, couldn&#39;t breathe); amoxicillin for abscessed tooth and had a reaction because of the sulphites in it; epinephrine (EPIPEN) and experienced epinephrine allergy (does not use it anymore); plantago ovata (METAMUCIL) which she then found out the orange one had sulphites. Historical vaccine included flu shot for immunization and she experienced 104-degree temperature and was sick as a dog and she went to the emergency room (she had flu shot maybe 3 times). Ongoing concomitant medication included multivitamins. The patient got her first dose of BNT162B2 on 29Mar2021 at 11:45. On the same day, once she got home, she became really, really tired/wiped out tired; was so sleepy; experienced sore arm/her arm started to hurt; was nauseous; had sore throat/throat hurt; eyes half closed/eyes closing and puffy face. On 30Mar2021, the patient experienced elevated pulse/her pulse got too high/pulse was 165 beats per minute/climbed up to 195. Her heart rate was 194 at some point for a couple of minutes then stayed at 165 for a long time. She hoped she wasn&#39;t having a heart attack. She had tightness in her chest, wasn&#39;t feeling good and was coughing. She stayed in her bed to wait out her symptoms. These lasted for 10 minutes (as reported). She started meditating hoping her heart rate would decrease and it did after about 15-20 minutes. The patient also felt feverish/felt hotter than usual. Before she took the vaccine on 29Mar2021, her temperature was at 96. She stated that her temperature usually runs low as 95-06 degrees. She also felt like her sinuses were congested; was sore; had puffy, bubbled up arms, inflamed. The patient hoped it was not a blood clot she developed. At the time of the report, the patient stated that her heart rate was 61 beats per minute, earlier it was in the 70s; and her temperature was at 96.3. Her second dose is scheduled on 19Apr2021 and mentioned that if these were her reactions with the first dose, she is questioning getting the second dose. The outcome of &#34;blood clot&#34;, &#34;hoped she wasn&#39;t having a heart attack&#34;, &#34;Wasn&#39;t feeling well&#34;, &#34;Tightness in chest&#34;, cough, and sinuses congested was unknown.

A 73-Year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, on 29Jan2021 (Lot Number: EN5318) at age of 72-year-old at SINGLE DOSE in Arm Right for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension from 2010 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  She was taking her regular prescribed medications which are primary for atrial fibrillation and hypertension, however she has been on these medications for years.The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 on 8Jan2021 (Lot Number: EL3246) as SINGLE DOSE in Left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  8 or 9 days later after she received the first dose, she broke out in rash on her upper left chest and shoulder area. It spread, and she then had a patch in the small of her back and then, her legs from her knees to ankles broke out. She reports that after her 1st vaccination she developed a rash 1 week after the injection. Explaining that its a &#34;strange rash some of which I still have on my chest, the small of my back and from my knees to my ankles&#34;, The &#34;ones on my legs have never really resolved, its pretty ugly and the dermatologist said it looks like eczema&#34;. The doctor gave her some topical steroid cream &#34;Mometaesone&#34; for all of these areas. However, her legs are still not cleared up. She still has lesions there. It looks and is like eczema, but the eczema treatments are not working. For some reason instead of staying as little bumps, the bumps developed into some large, scaly patches. It&#39;s those scaly patches that are red and nasty looking which is what the dermatologist has been treating. She was also prescribed Ammonium Lactate lotion which kind of helps with the scaliness that the area produces. The patient received both doses of the COVID vaccine. Both shots were given around 1-2pm. The reaction to the second dose is far more troubling and problematic in all sorts of ways than the first dose. About 7 or 8 days after the second shot, she began to have joint pain in her elbows. She was told she has acute tendinitis and was given oral steroids to take and she was sent to physical therapy. She has had general 24HR a day intense pain in both arms. It&#39;s to the point she can&#39;t straighten her arms out completely, she can&#39;t bend them completely, especially early in the morning when she first wakes up and everything is kind of stiff. She can&#39;t even brush her teeth without having to prop her elbow on the edge of the sink. She can&#39;t brush her hair, wash her hair without pain. She has to get her partner to undo her bra because she can&#39;t. She was given a Medrol pack. With the second one, &#34;My elbows began to hurt, ortho did x-rays and said nothing was wrong with them, and that it may be tendonitis. PT who is a hand and extremity therapist said my swelling is strange and asked if I had Rheumatoid problems. She states she has to go back to dermatologist next week for them to look at the area again. In the mean time, she has taken oral steroids and topical steroids and not much has done any good. She has had reactions autoimmune disorders to both of her vaccinations, the reactions began about a week after getting vaccinated. It was stated that these symptoms are better than dying of COVID but its very unpleasant. She has had X-rays done but it showed there was nothing wrong with her joints. No one has done any blood test. The orthopedic people took X-rays because she told them her elbow hurts. She was told that there was nothing wrong with her elbows, but she does have all this other stuff going on. She clarifies she has tendonitis, tennis elbow, golf elbow- but the hasn&#39;t had anything to cause this, and she was told they are really, really bad. Her right wrist is swollen up twice its normal size as is her right elbow. It has been going on now since February, March, April. Her left arm is doing a little bit better but her right arm is pretty acute. She confirms this swelling is still ongoing and persisting in her right arm.  The AEs require a visit to Physician Office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. AE following prior vaccinations was No. She mentions she was in the military and she received many vaccines from cholera to small pox and beyond. She never had a reaction. The outcome of Joint swelling was not recovered, of left arm swelling was recovering, of other events were unknown.  No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected.

                                                Started with join pain for a few days, started taking one Aleve a day. The muscles became extremely sore. Joint pain increased, involving shoulders, hands, legs, arms, knees and hips. Left hand began swelling on January 23rd and continued so I could no longer see my knuckles and it ballooned and it was hot and very painful. The knees were so bad it was almost impossible to stand from a sitting position and walking was stiff. Could not sleep laying down because pain in shoulders and knees would increase.   I went to the doctor on the 26th.   he prescribed Prednisolone for one week and I am scheduled to see him next Tuesday February 2nd.

I had to increase the Lotemax drops to four/day to get it to stop. My eye surgeon says that it is not a sign of rejection. I also got a cold sore on my upper lip, which is highly unusual. I had reduce the Xeljanz to a half dose before the shot.

Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine she developed new numbness and swelling in her tongue, along with numbness in her extremities. She was given 0.3 mg epinephrine per protocol and was then advised to be seen in the emergency department. Her symptoms resolved once she arrived at the emergency department. She was observed for a period of two hours without worsening symptoms and was then discharged. presented to the ED following pfizer vaccine ingestion. received epinephrine IM prehospital for report of tongue swelling and and numbness at the time. She was improved at the time of presentation to the ED. Observed for several hours and discharged home without recrudescent sx. Although cannot find objective evidence of tongue swelling, administration of epi prehospital with report of improvement of symptoms is suggestive that this was a true anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine.

                                                a sharp pain was coming from the side of my back and shooting to my left breast/ a muscle on the side going down of my back/ sharp pain when I make a turn or reach that goes to my breast; when she moves that she has a pain that goes through the lymph nodes or muscles behind her left breast; when she moves that she has a pain that goes through the lymph nodes or muscles behind her left breast; pain was either from something in her left shoulder, or the left side of her back, or a muscle; feeling a little down and out; she can&#39;t sleep in the heat at night; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number: EL8982 ), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 23Jan2021 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were on patient medical history and concomitant medications. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).The patient said she did good on Saturday, 23Jan2021, saying her left arm didn&#39;t get sore. She said she did good on Sunday, 24Jan2021. She stated &#34;I didn&#39;t get sore, but it just seemed like maybe a few days ago it seemed like a sharp pain was coming from the side of my back and shooting to my left breast (on 25Jan2021). It only does it when I am lying down and not when I am sitting down. I drank plenty of water and continue to drink plenty of water. Today, I am feeling a little down and out because of my breast (25Jan2021). My breast itself is not sore at all. It seems like maybe a muscle on the side going down of my back. There is a sharp pain when I make a turn or reach that goes to my breast. Well, if you have arthritis it could be that.&#34; She said it seemed when she moves or turns, she has a sharp pain in her left breast. The patient asked if the sharp pain she was experiencing in her left breast area were possibly her lymph nodes. She clarified her left breast was not sore, but the area behind her left breast has a pain go through it. She said it was just when she moves that she has a pain that goes through the lymph nodes or muscles behind her left breast. She said she normally doesn&#39;t sleep on her left side, but if she sleeps on her left side, the pain behind her left breast was better. She said she does not have big breasts and was not wearing a bra when she had the pain in her left breast area. She said she was wondering if the pain she has is from her lymph nodes or muscles in her back. She said the pain was either from something in her left shoulder, or the left side of her back, or a muscle. As treatment, patient reported that she has been holding her left breast area when she moves. She said holding the left breast area helps lessen the pain, but the pain was still there. She said she has been trying to troubleshoot her pain. She said she drinks coffee every day and thought maybe she was drinking too much caffeine. She said she can&#39;t sleep in the heat at night, so she turns the heat off in her house at midnight, but her house was still warm (70 degrees) when she wakes up in the morning. She said she thought that maybe the cold weather got into her back and left shoulder. She said she checked her left breast for lumps and didn&#39;t find any lumps. She said the only thing left for her to do was to contact her gynecologist and go have a mammogram. She doesn&#39;t take any medicine. She said she does take something for sleep as needed, but she would have to be going without sleep for a long time before she would take that medicine. She reported she is otherwise a healthy person. She said people talk about hormones changes after when a person used to have a period, and she sometimes doesn&#39;t know if her pain would be because of that. She said she may have irritation in her breasts from wearing a bra that may be too tight, but the pain she was experiencing now was different from that pain. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of the events she can&#39;t sleep in the heat at night and feeling a little down and out was unknown; and not recovered outcome for the other events.

Did a telemed appointment with her physician who told her to take one dose of the Epi-Pen, Benadryl, Prednisone, Ventolin, and Singulair.  These medications have worn off, and wants her to take even more doses of the Prednisone, Benadryl and the inhaler.  She is still having symptoms, but improving.  She does not itch as badly.  Her arm is sore.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer COVID vaccine), lot no. EL347, via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a health department because she was at high risk and she was 73. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient had an injection done 2 weeks, not this last Friday, the Friday before that. They had to make her wait for half an hour before she left and she was okay. Then Saturday (23Jan2021), she started feeling achy but to she was okay. Then Sunday (24Jan2021), she had a very bad experience, she went and start watching TV and she fell asleep. When she woke up, she didn&#39;t know what time, what date, nothing. And she looked at the time on her TV and it said 6:45, she didn&#39;t know if it was am or pm. And it was dark outside and she didn&#39;t know if it was Monday or Sunday. She was all confused, she called someone to make sure what day and time and all and still she was still confused. And then she had to call her aunt and then she told her no it&#39;s Sunday and it&#39;s night time and so on. Then she got better. Then during the week she didn&#39;t have that much body ache, she expected that because that was in that papers. Then today is Sunday, Friday morning (29Jan2021) she got up and she coughed, when she coughed it was blood in that cough couple of times. Then her daughter came over and took her to the hospital (hospitalization details were not clarified). She had lab work the day they took her in the emergency room. At the hospital, they did all kind of tests, on top of that her leg, her left leg swelled up from her feet to all the way up, all the way up. They thought that it could have been some blood clot. And they took test and all and nothing, everything was okay. They couldn&#39;t find out why her whole leg was swollen. On top of that, they did chest x-ray and they did something else she can&#39;t remember, another test. And they took all kind of blood work and all. And they did to see if she had the virus, the COVID. And yesterday they called her from the hospital and they said that she didn&#39;t have the virus. And she asked them about the blood work and they told her if there was anything more than they would call her. So, she thinks all this came from that injection. She called because this was not guaranteed if this was from injection. When confirmed that COVID test was negative and blood work report was not out, she stated they haven&#39;t called her that meant her blood work was okay. The swollen leg has been gone down and blood once in a while she sees a little bit. They gave her 2 prescriptions, one was antibiotic and one is steroid. Due date for the next shot is 12Feb2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Got the vaccine and within 30-an hour she was seated, waiting and she developed a tingling/numbness on her bottom lip to the center of her lip.  It spread throughout the entire bottom lip.  Then it moved to the left hand corner of her mouth as well, and then moved up to the left side of her face to her eye, and then to the corner of the left hand of her head.  This is a tingly pressure, and it then developed into a hard headache concentrated in one spot.  She went into heavy sweating.  The pharmacist was watching her and came over to her, she was there for about an hour and a half.  She had a bottle of water trying to cool off, and her tongue was getting a bad taste in her mouth, and numbness in the back of her tongue.  The pharmacist gave her Benadryl to take and she sat there for a while and was starting to feel really shaky, and she thought she would go back to her apartment to get out of being around other people.  She was feeling weak to walk, and overwhelmingly tired.  Once she did get into her apartment she her taste buds felt dry.   After several days of this reaction, little by little it subsided, but the sweating and chills continue even up until today, 3/26/21.  She goes to bed dry and wakes up soaked from sweat due to profuse sweating.  She has been yawing a lot lately and if she does yawn she immediately has chills.  It&#39;s been back and forth with the chills/fever.  She can be perspiring on one end and the other end cold.  She tried to talk to her doctor but told her to seek out UC for her symptoms as he is too busy.    There is eye strain that is bothering her which leads her into wanting to sleep and sleeps for extended periods of time and really exhausted.  Has also had runny nose, hands and feet swelling.  Her right hand is kind of like a tingling/weakness sensation.

                                                The patient is a 73yr old female with multiple comorbidities including but not limiting to ESRD  on dialysis, DM, COPD on home oxygen, OSA not compliant with CPAP at home, pulmonary hypertension, tachy-brady syndrome s/p pacemaker in March 2021, with multiple admissions (?6) this year already, admitted with septic shock, NSTEMI on 4/13/2021. She underwent R foot debridement and amputation on 4/16/2021. ID team treated with Vanco/Cefepime. On 4/18 afternoon, she developed PEA and coded for about 25min. Since ROSC, she never regained consciousness. This morning, at the beginning of my shift at 7am, she&#39;s on bicarb drip, maxed Levophed 100, Epi 100 drips and full vent. However, she was getting paced and BP stayed in 40s. I discussed with ICU pharmacist and gave her stress dose Solu-cortef. Checked serum cortisol level, turned out to be appropriate later. Lactic acid 22 and bicarb was only 2 despite being on Bicarb drip. I called Shauna/daughter to  inform her about guarded prognosis (imminent death) and asked to bring husband to come see her asap. Before family arrived, she developed another PEA and code blue was called. She was given Epi, bicarb pushes and CPR started immediately. Code blue was unsuccessful. At 8:13am, she was pronounced dead. I called daughter again to notify her of patient&#39;s death. Family arrived around 10am. I met both daughter and husband at bedside and offered emotional support. Chaplain was consulted.

She reported that she went to the emergency room on 06Apr2021 and was found to have an extremely extensive deep vein thrombosis. She reported that she was calling to complete a safety report. She stated that she doesn&#39;t want a deep vein thrombosis to happen to anyone else if her thrombus was from the Covid-19 vaccine. She reported that she and her husband thought they were so lucky as they had no side effects whatsoever following the Covid-19 vaccine doses. She reported that she was not saying that the deep vein thrombosis was from the Covid-19 vaccine but she has never had any blood or clotting problems in her life.

She reported that she had 2 surgeries last year, a knee replacement in her left leg and an Achilles tendon repair in her right leg. She reported that when she was released from physical therapy that the therapist told the caller that she might have lymphedema. She reported that the physical therapist directed her to go to a clinic that had no doctor where the clinic staff wanted her to buy a (dollar)10,000 piece of equipment to pump up her legs in the morning and at night. She reported that she came home from the clinic and called the podiatrist that repaired her Achilles tendon. She reported that she went to see the podiatrist that day and that the podiatrist ordered an ultrasound. She reported that a vascular surgeon called her regarding the ultrasound and stated that there was nothing wrong with the veins in her legs.

After receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, medically, she seemed fine. Then, she progressively has gotten worse. First EMS was called. This was about less than a week later after receiving the vaccine. Then, she was admitted into the hospital with a kidney infection and she has progressively declined. She has no idea if it was related to the COVID-19 vaccine or not. She initially called regarding the second COVID-19 vaccine. She didn&#39;t know what would happen if her mother didn&#39;t show up for her second vaccine. She didn&#39;t know if she would get on the &#34;never going to get the vaccine&#34; list or what as her mother was just so unstable. On an unspecified date, her blood pressure was so low right now they can&#39;t even transfer her to the hospital that can perform the surgery she needs. The reporter stated that she has no idea if this was COVID related or what. She began having problems less than a week later after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, she mentioned Wednesday. On 27Jan2021, her mother began having issues with her kidneys and has progressively declined since. Consumer stated her mother was swollen from head to toe with edema on an unspecified date and that was how this all kind of started. Her mother became very weak and didn&#39;t tell anyone. She fell using her walker on Wednesday and the EMS was called. Her mother told the EMS she wasn&#39;t hurt but was just too weak to get up and EMS got her up.  Her primary care doctor sent her for an x-ray, and she had some wheezing in her chest. She was given an antibiotic for that. The patient fell again, and the EMS was called and had some face lacerations and stuff, so she was taken to the hospital. Consumer confirmed her mother was admitted into the hospital and was first diagnosed with a kidney infection and it has progressively gotten worse. Outcome of event kidney infection was not recovered; and outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information on lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                I had some of the listed side effects. i.e., pain and redness at injection site and fatigue. However, by Feb 21  noticed swelling under my armpit on the left side as well as somewhat swollen nodes in the left side of my neck. The swelling under my arm became worse over the next two days. When I raised my left arm I felt considerable pain. Over the next 2 days I also had swelling in my left forearm near bend in my elbow. I also had a rash the size of a patch above the injection site.  I looked this issue up online and found reports that approximately 16% of women who had received the 2nd Covid shot experienced swelling under the armpit. I contacted my doctor by e mail .  I switched from taking tylelnol to advil.  All side effects are gone except there is still a little swelling in armpit.  I contacted my Doctor and will see her on March 15th if the swelling is not gone.

A 74-year-old female patient receive the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), intramuscularly at site of right arm on 28Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included (synthroid: Taking for years), prevent urinary tract infection (UTI) (methenamine: started a year and a half ago), vitamin supplementation (Preservision Areds 2 eye vitamins more than a year ago; Vitamin C with Zinc 8-9 months ago), dry eyes (Thera tears: dry eye therapy. she has not been consistent with taking), cholesterol (simvastatin: taking 20 years or more), allergic to Sulfa Drugs and Tetracycline, obesity (had been fighting it for 30 years), removed polyps (had a flat polyp that was a little more dangerous the first time and it was removed; non-cancerous), got the flu (08Jun months later, got the flu, went to the hospital and developed PNA) and eczema (took calcium 1200mg). Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid; methenamine for prevent UTI; ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2) for vitamin supplementation; ascorbic acid, zinc (VITAMIN C WITH ZINC) for vitamin supplementation; carmellose sodium (THERA TEARS) for dry eyes; simvastatin for cholesterol; calcium for eczema. The patient previously took Flu vaccine (Injection site was left arm, intramuscularly) in Oct2018 and experienced pain in injection site and redness in arm; took the first dose of BNT162B2 with lot number: EL3246, intramuscularly in left arm site at 09:00 on 08Jan2021. Clinical course: After the second dose of vaccination, patient noticed tenderness at vaccinate site at 13:00 and had pain in arm on 28Jan2021, but on 29Jan2021, the pain was worse, and she had difficulty lifting her right arm at 16:00. On 30Jan2021, she started noticing more pain when she lifted her arm, her arm pits, it was hurting under arm when she was lifting. She thought maybe there were swollen glands but did not feel it. her temperate was 100.8, and she took some paracetamol (TYLENOL), by the evening, her temperature was at 98.6 normal. On 31Jan2021, she noticed a lot of pain, itching and redness, redness moved from actual site down her arm about 6 to 7 inches at 14:00. The pain in her right arm was not as bad as it was, but the redness in the area and itching was there, it was hot to touch area on right arm, and she tried cold compresses and took paracetamol. Also, it was hurting under her arm when she was lifting. She experienced something like that before with a Flu vaccine. She noticed when she looked it up, the information states, yes. And it was still going on today, not so much pain, just swelling and redness, looked like what Moderna calls a covid arm. She had no temperature, a little headache on 31Jan2021 at the back of the head and tired, very tired, she was tired from 29Jan2021, and was better from 01Feb2021. She took paracetamol last night, and cold compress. she used to take baby aspirin; she didn&#39;t know if it would be a problem. She read not to take paracetamol or ibuprofen before vaccination. She felt tugging and redness when she raised her arm, it was not red its blotchy. She didn&#39; t feel any swelling. The last 7 to 8 months, she was running high blood counts, 12.3 (high) and she had no infection, her doctor was a little nervous, the last one on 15Jan2021, it was down to 10.2 within normal range. Her immune system was very active. She had a flu shot in Oct2018 at age of 72 y/o and by 08Jun months later, she got the flu. She went to the hospital and developed PNA. In 2019 and again this past Aug2020, she had a Colonoscopy where they removed polyps. She had a flat polyp that was a little more dangerous the first time and it was removed. It was non-cancerous. The doctor was just watching it. Last blood results were 2 weeks prior to having first shot on 15Jan2021. The only thing that showed was her Liver enzymes were a little elevated. She was told that if she hadn&#39;t gotten the vaccine, it would have been worse, her doctor gave me the zpack. They were calling it a subcutaneous sensitivity, she had eczema, she forgot to mention that. She was taking calcium 1200mg, she forgot to tell her that also. The outcome of events pain in arm, redness and feeling hot was not recovered; of events tiredness, body temperature increased, itching and headache was recovering; of rest events was unknown.

Went to bed, and woke up and her arm is swollen, it&#39;s like she has a frozen shoulder, is pounding pain, extremely tight, difficult to move, can&#39;t move it, and very constricted which prevents her from using it.   The pain goes all the way down to her elbow.  She cannot use the left hand, and when she tries to move her arm at the elbow has excruciating pain.

That nite, my heart started POUNDING HARD all night, not stop. Ativan not help. I slept, weird dreams, wake up and still heart pounding.  8 am --- got up and hands, arms, extremities SWOLLEN!! Heart still pounding,  Felt like allergic to MSG or nitrates or preservatives or too much salt. Felt weird.. Not faint-- just weird. Tired from the pounding heart. Not fatigued.  I did have sore arm, but it was NOT an issue.  My hands, toes were red.

                                                I began feeling deeply fatigued and achy about six hours after the vaccination and went to bed.  The aches and fatigue continued the next day and evening and, additionally, I had a swelling in my left wrist of the arm that I had the shot in.  That swelling was painful; it  was about an inch across and looked like it contained fluid.  All those symptoms continued for two more days and then the swelling began to subside and is now gone..  Today, the morning of the fifth day after the vaccination, I awoke at 3 a.m. with severe body aches, took two Tylenol and eventually was able to sleep again.  I am feeling better but very, very tired and have some bodyaches and headache but not as severe.

                                                I had two symptoms that are normal, they were on the list of side effects, I had soreness on my left arm, I couldn&#39;t sleep on my left arm due to this soreness. This started the day the soreness started. The following day and up till now I felt very tired and like I needed to take a nap. Due to work I have not been able to nap. On Sunday I noticed I had a fever blister on the right side of face, under my lip by my chin. It looked like a herpes blister. I rarely get them unless there is a serious stressor to my body or if my body is emotionally stressed. Valacyclozir I took 4 of those in the morning and 4 tablets in the evening after noticing them. I put a cream on the blister. On Tuesday or Wednesday 3 or 4 days after the vaccine I felt a pain in my gum by back two teeth, the gums were very painful when I brushed my teeth or put my tongue on it.  I went to the dentist Friday the 22nd, however the dentist said it was intraoral herpes that he believes it is looked to the vaccine. Dr. believes the COVID vaccine activated the dormant herpes in my system . He said says it is located over the Greater Palatine Foramen.  The herpes on my chin went away. I still feel light sensitivity and fatigued. Dr recommended to see my dermatologist. Either the 22nd or 23rd I had a virutal appointment with my dermatologist. She recommended I take 4 Valacyclozir in the AM and PM. And then 1 day for 10 days. Both doctors recommended not getting the 2nd dose until the herpes vaccine goes away. Once it goes away they suggested taking the Valacyclozir before taking the 2nd dose. I am still not feeling normal. My dentist said he was going to consult a group of dentists to see if any other dentists have seen the correlation between the COVID vaccine and activating the herpes virus.  I plan to consult my PCP about if I should delay the 2nd dose.

She game the same advise and told to make sure to call back if needed.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                About 11 am I was masked in church and developed a tickle in my throat.  I cleared my throat to no relief.  I took 2 cough drops. About 11:30 I got a bottle of water.  No relief after drinking 8 ounces.  I left the service, went outside, removed my mask and was coughing forcibly for about 15 minutes or so.  Expectorated clear phlegm 6 - 8 times.  Gradually I settled to normal.  Just some residual soreness in throat.  This was an unusual occurrence for me.   I was covid positive in early Dec, but had a very mild case. Back in the 70&#39;s I would have reaction to allergy shots.  I waited in the office 15 minutes, but 45 minutes later when I arrived home I had huge hives and severe itching.

Noticed my left arm was sore at the injection site and now my arm is red and a bit swollen from my shoulder to my elbow, plus a little itchy but no rash.  Was taking Tylenol and icing it until my friend told me not to ice it.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Feb2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 75-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination.  Medical history included reverse total shoulder replacement on 26Jan2021, cardiomyopathy from an unknown date, and type 2 diabetes mellitus from an unknown date.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received her shingles shot (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and flu shot (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); both in Oct2020 for immunization and had no reactions.  On 05Feb2021 at 16:00, the patient experienced hives and itching. On 05Feb2020, the patient had blotches, blistering, swollen hands, and cracked creases with serous fluid coming out of the hands. The clinical course was as follows: She had absolutely no problem at the time of the injection, no soreness with it she was fine and then she had welts starting with 2-3 then all over her body, that were itching terribly. They stared on the left wrist, both hands. The patient took diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL); but it did not help. The patient then went to the emergency room (ER). By the time she got to the ER, the hives moved up to her abdomen and she was covered in big blistery looking raisings and few small raises on her trunk and arms. The hives were concentrated from her fingers to her elbow, and then there were other blotches on her elbows to her fingers that were real concentrated. She stayed at the hospital for 3 hours, but she was not admitted. At the ER, she received pantoprazole (PROTONIX), diphenhydramine hydrochloride, hydroxyzine (ATARAX) and prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient also stated that her hands were so swollen after getting the dose of the vaccine that she couldn&#39;t get them closed and she had cracking creases with serous fluid coming out of both hands. The swelling went down a little bit the next day; but she still had the blotches. She said the itch was tolerated. However, the blistering started again. Her doctor put her on a sliding scale of prednisone and diphenhydramine at 25 mg every 6 hours. The clinical outcome of the swelling hands was recovering; while that of the blotches and blisters were not recovered. The clinical outcomes of the hives, itching, and cracked creases with serous fluid coming out of the hands were unknown. The patient assessed the events to be medically significant as she had never experienced anything like this.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal relationship, a possible contribution role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3248, NDC/UPC number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 12Jan2021 at 10:00 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine facility type was reported as the &#34;doctor&#39;s office/urgent care.&#34; Relevant medical history included high blood pressure, but it was controlled blood pressure/hypertension; asthma, for which she was not taking medication at the time of the report, because it was under control; non allergic rhinitis; pre diabetes; and a little overweight. The patient further stated that she had just general medical history, which she had everything under control. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), atorvastatin (LIPITOR), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), and metformin. The patient previously took to iodine, doxycycline, erythromycin, and azithromycin, for which the patient had known allergies to all of it. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID-19 prior vaccination. She was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient stated that on 12Jan2021 at 10:30, she had adverse reactions to the Pfizer vaccine; she had severe allergic reaction within about 30 minutes and then they call the paramedic she ended up and they gave her a shot, which she did not know if it was prednisone. It was further reported that she took her inhaler too as they said she was wheezing, which she didn&#39;t really feel in her lungs. The patient just felt that what happen was she went to the car as they said to wait 15 minutes as written, and she always follow the rules and the whole thing they said, she waited 30 minutes, so she went down side of her car then she figured that she could just drive off drive home. So, she was in car sitting or waiting for the last 30 minutes and all of a sudden she felt right through her chest like through her right side kind of going into her left; it was weird like she could feel going into her body, then suddenly her heart start beating really fast, and then she pulled down the vizor and looked in the rearview mirror and her face was all red, so she go back to the site. That&#39;s how she transpired and then, that&#39;s how the reaction was. It was further reported that the patient waited 15 minutes in the office, then went to car to wait additional 15 minutes, and suddenly felt strange sensation in her chest and her heart started beating very rapidly. She pulled down the visor in car and saw her face growing red and swelling slightly and her breathing was becoming labored. She had read on side effects on information she was given on departure stating symptoms of an allergic reaction. She returned to the facility at which time she was treated. The adverse events (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient had no investigation assessment. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events, which included that the patient was given a shot of 125 mg of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL), but another report said they gave her prednisone so they were kind of conflicting in the report, but it was a shot, and also cetirizine (ZYRTEC) and famotidine (PEPCID), and her inhaler for wheezing. The patient recovered from all the events on an unspecified date.

The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date (lot EL8982) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the right arm. The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.

                                                At 12:30a.m. I awoke after the shot to shooting pain on the left side of my head that would last for seconds and continue every few minutes.  My arm was hurting a lot also, but I expected that.  I took an Ibuprophen but it continued now coming every 10 minutes.  My son told me to take 3 ibuprofen at a time every 4 hours that allowed me to go back to sleep.  When I awoke I continued the ibuprofen but in the afternoon I was getting the shooting pains in my left ear.  SO I continued the ibuprofen.  On Sunday m72 hours after the shot my arm was so swollen and red with pain and itching.  I called my doctor and she said to take ibuprofen and come in if it is not better on Monday.

                                                arthritis; fingers on right were all swollen; she could barely move her arm; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; light headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient.  A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 at 10:40 (at the age of 75-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included arthritis from an unknown date, renal cancer since 07Dec2020 and ongoing, atrial fibrillation since 2006 and ongoing,  partial nephrectomy on 06 Jan2021. She specified that she has an arthritis flare up about once a year and normally takes a Medrol dose pack.  The patient&#39;s historical vaccines included an unspecified flu vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) on an unspecified date about ten years ago after which she had to go to the Emergency Room for right arm redness, swelling at the injection site and face swelling on right side. She did not get another flu shot for 10 years but did get one this year in Nov2020. Concomitant medication included metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), flecainide acetate (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN, MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reports that she experienced a light headache. She clarified that she is in an unspecified program which includes an e-diary. As part of that program (app) she was sent a text every day for a week asking if she had any side effects; a couple times she had a headache.  On the eighth day (03Feb2021) she had a reaction where her right hand and wrist was painful and swollen. Caller states she couldn&#39;t move her hand without pain. Caller states she put ice on her hand Wednesday evening and this helped a little.  When ice was on her hand it helped with the pain but when it was removed it came back. She also reported fingers on right were all swollen and that she does have arthritis.  She further described the events as on Wednesday she started getting a little pain in her right wrist joint. She does have arthritis, but this pain was stronger, and her hand and fingers on right were all swollen in comparison to her other hand, and her knuckles seemed bigger. States that the pain got very strong and by the next morning she could barely move her arm; even though it was only her wrist that hurt, moving any part of her arm made her wrist her more, so she started icing it and took Tylenol for Arthritis 650mg Extended Release; she took it twice, one each time and reported that it probably didn&#39;t work. Caller clarifies statement about it probably not working; stating that she didn&#39;t notice a difference after taking the Tylenol.  She asked if these events, occurring eight days after the vaccine could be vaccine side effects or is this just a flare up on her arthritis that is unrelated to the vaccine. She added that she had been doing a lot of &#34;chopping&#34; while cooking on the night that this happened so that may have caused the flare up. She has a Medrol pack on hand for things like this (4mg tablets). She started it today and took two tablets before breakfast and one tablet at lunch. She states that it has already made a difference in her pain. She stated her concern, however, which is that she found that taking a steroid could affect the vaccine if taken before getting the vaccine, and right now she is in-between the two doses.  Her second dose is scheduled for 16Feb2021. She inquired as to if she can finish this dose pack without messing up the vaccine. The clinical outcome of headache was reported as recovered. The clinical outcomes of  hand swelling, wrist pain, hand pain and swelling of wrists were reported as not recovered. The clinical outcomes of arthritis flare up, swelling of fingers and could not move her arm were unknown.

I haven&#39;t had a cold sore in many, many years and have only gotten one if I have been in the sun too long or have a high fever.  I called the doctor on call the following morning  and asked for a prescription of acyclovir. Starting it that late resulted in not stopping the progression of the cold sore. Also had runny nose (haven&#39;t had a cold since masking started last year), and a red swollen arm..still red and swollen two days later and a terrible headache (started the day after injection and still bad today which is two days after).

A 75-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6207) at the age of 75-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetic type 2 for probably 13-14 years, sleep apnea for 20 years (2001), arthritis in 2005 (probably 12-14 years), and blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure). Concomitant medications included metformin, sertraline, alprazolam, sitagliptin (JANUVIA), oxybutynin, insulin glargine (LANTUS), lisinopril for blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure), and cortisone for arthritis. The patient received the vaccine on 13Mar2021 in the afternoon and within 24 to 30 hours, the next day (14Mar2021), her right arm, where the vaccine was administered turned all red and swollen and her elbow also hurt. She went to the emergency room because she felt it was a reaction to the vaccine. They told her that it was a bacterial skin infection, an adverse effect of an initial encounter to the vaccine, arm swelling and bursitis caused by that, muscle pain and join pain in elbow and then she guessed it was like cellulitis. They gave her ROCEPHIN at the emergency room and then a couple days later, it wasn&#39;t getting any better and it was all the way down to her wrist. She went to immediate care center and received an antibiotic. She was also given 2 more prescription of antibiotics and told that it had to be administered with the antibiotics to get rid of the reactions. It has finally pretty much cleared up with the antibiotics if they hadn&#39;t put her in an immediate care and put her on intravenous medications. They were really concerned because it was going to get into sepsis or something. At first, the patient thought that it was just inflamed, then it was skin infection and then adverse effect from the initial encounter of the vaccine. She had been on the antibiotics for 10 days when it finally cleared, but the elbow was still sore and it hurts a lot, but the fluid was drained by an orthopedic doctor. She was given 2 different types of antibiotics plus a shot into her buttocks. It&#39;s a little sore because she was informed that &#34;the bruise have been flamed&#34; on Mar2021. When she went to emergency, first they give her 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched antibiotic to DURICEF and to BACTRIM DS, and advised to continue monitoring and if swelling and redness was progressive or worse, then go to emergency room again. She went to emergency room on 16Mar2021, the medicine given was doxycycline and then she was seen by an orthopedic physician today where the fluid was drained from her elbow but swelling and redness was progressively getting worst and she was feeling hot on Mar2021. So, she went to the immediate care. Overall, consistent to cellulitis of right upper arm strongly includes to go to the ER but the patient had something else and had to go right then. And then, she was given 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched to DURACEF and BACTRIM. She came back to the ER on the same day. It was kind of 2 things, like the redness and skin infection which currently was cellulitis. Doxycycline was what they told her to get, that&#39;s what they gave her at the emergency room, doxycycline hyclate. And then said to follow-up with her primary care which she did and that was on 17Mar2021. She looked at it and then they told her to see an orthopedic surgeon and she saw him on the 18Mar2021. They just thought that the antibiotics, that&#39;s why he gave her 2 different prescriptions plus the shot in the buttocks because he said if this will not be cured with the antibiotics, she&#39;ll end up in a hospital. And then it was raft and it took her 10 days to recover. And he marked little black dots to show where wasn&#39;t and if it goes beyond that then call us because it was spreading. The outcome of the events bruise and feeling hot was unknown, not recovered for joint pain, and recovered on 24Mar2021 for all other events. The events required emergency room visit/ physician office visit.
